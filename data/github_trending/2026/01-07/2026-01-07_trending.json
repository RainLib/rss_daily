Download directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/releases) or [opencode.ai/download](https://opencode.ai/download).\n\n| Platform              | Download                              |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `opencode-desktop-darwin-aarch64.dmg` |\n| macOS (Intel)         | `opencode-desktop-darwin-x64.dmg`     |\n| Windows               | `opencode-desktop-windows-x64.exe`    |\n| Linux                 | `.deb`, `.rpm`, or AppImage           |\n\n```bash\n# macOS (Homebrew)\nbrew install --cask opencode-desktop\n```\n\n#### Installation Directory\n\nThe install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:\n\n1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory\n2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path\n3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)\n4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback\n\n```bash\n# Examples\nOPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash\nXDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash\n```\n\n### Agents\n\nOpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between with the `Tab` key.\n\n- **build** - Default, full access agent for development work\n- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration\n  - Denies file edits by default\n  - Asks permission before running bash commands\n  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes\n\nAlso, included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks.\nThis is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.\n\nLearn more about [agents](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents).\n\n### Documentation\n\nFor more info on how to configure OpenCode [**head over to our docs**](https://opencode.ai/docs).\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to OpenCode, please read our [contributing docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.\n\n### Building on OpenCode\n\nIf you are working on a project that's related to OpenCode and is using \"opencode\" as a part of its name; for example, \"opencode-dashboard\" or \"opencode-mobile\", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in any way.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### How is this different from Claude Code?\n\nIt's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:\n\n- 100% open source\n- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen); OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.\n- Out of the box LSP support\n- A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.\n- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow OpenCode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.\n\n---\n\n**Join our community** [Discord](https://discord.gg/opencode) | [X.com](https://x.com/opencode)\n",

The IP associated with a given domain can be found by querying the Domain Name System (DNS) for the domain's A (address) record.\n\n###### Use Cases\nFinding the IP of a given server is the first step to conducting further investigations, as it allows us to probe the server for additional info. Including creating a detailed map of a target's network infrastructure, pinpointing the physical location of a server, identifying the hosting service, and even discovering other domains that are hosted on the same IP address.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [Understanding IP Addresses](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-ip-addresses-subnets-and-cidr-notation-for-networking)\n- [IP Addresses - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)\n- [RFC-791 Internet Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791)\n- [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>SSL Chain</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/kB7LsV1/wc-ssl.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nSSL certificates are digital certificates that authenticate the identity of a website or server, enable secure encrypted communication (HTTPS), and establish trust between clients and servers. A valid SSL certificate is required for a website to be able to use the HTTPS protocol, and encrypt user + site data in transit. SSL certificates are issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs), which are trusted third parties that verify the identity and legitimacy of the certificate holder.\n\n###### Use Cases\nSSL certificates not only provide the assurance that data transmission to and from the website is secure, but they also provide valuable OSINT data. Information from an SSL certificate can include the issuing authority, the domain name, its validity period, and sometimes even organization details. This can be useful for verifying the authenticity of a website, understanding its security setup, or even for discovering associated subdomains or other services.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [TLS - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)\n- [What is SSL (via Cloudflare learning)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/)\n- [RFC-8446 - TLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446)\n- [SSL Checker](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>DNS Records</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7Q1kMwM/wc-dns.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task involves looking up the DNS records associated with a specific domain. DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. Various types of DNS records exist, including A (address), MX (mail exchange), NS (name server), CNAME (canonical name), and TXT (text), among others.\n\n###### Use Cases\nExtracting DNS records can provide a wealth of information in an OSINT investigation. For example, A and AAAA records can disclose IP addresses associated with a domain, potentially revealing the location of servers. MX records can give clues about a domain's email provider. TXT records are often used for various administrative purposes and can sometimes inadvertently leak internal information. Understanding a domain's DNS setup can also be useful in understanding how its online infrastructure is built and managed.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [What are DNS records? (via Cloudflare learning)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/)\n- [DNS Record Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types)\n- [RFC-1035 - DNS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035)\n- [DNS Lookup (via MxToolbox)](https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Cookies</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/TTQ6DtP/wc-cookies.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThe Cookies task involves examining the HTTP cookies set by the target website. Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. They hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, such as site preferences, the state of the user's session, or tracking information.\n\n###### Use Cases\nCookies can disclose information about how the website tracks and interacts with its users. For instance, session cookies can reveal how user sessions are managed, and tracking cookies can hint at what kind of tracking or analytics frameworks are being used. Additionally, examining cookie policies and practices can offer insights into the site's security settings and compliance with privacy regulations.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [HTTP Cookie Docs (Mozilla)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)\n- [What are Cookies (via Cloudflare Learning)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-are-cookies/)\n- [Testing for Cookie Attributes (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/02-Testing_for_Cookies_Attributes)\n- [RFC-6265 - Coolies](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Crawl Rules</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/KwQCjPf/wc-robots.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nRobots.txt is a file found (usually) at the root of a domain, and is used to implement the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) to indicate which pages should be ignored by which crawlers and bots. It's good practice to avoid search engine crawlers from over-loading your site, but should not be used to keep pages out of search results (use the noindex meta tag or header instead).\n\n###### Use Cases\nIt's often useful to check the robots.txt file during an investigation, as it can sometimes disclose the directories and pages that the site owner doesn't want to be indexed, potentially because they contain sensitive information, or reveal the existence of otherwise hidden or unlinked directories. Additionally, understanding crawl rules may offer insights into a website's SEO strategies.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [Google Search Docs - Robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro)\n- [Learn about robots.txt (via Moz.com)](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt)\n- [RFC-9309 -  Robots Exclusion Protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9309/)\n- [Robots.txt - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Headers</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/t3xcwP1/wc-headers.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThe Headers task involves extracting and interpreting the HTTP headers sent by the target website during the request-response cycle. HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent at the start of an HTTP response, or before the actual data. Headers contain important directives for how to handle the data being transferred, including cache policies, content types, encoding, server information, security policies, and more.\n\n###### Use Cases\nAnalyzing HTTP headers can provide significant insights in an OSINT investigation. Headers can reveal specific server configurations, chosen technologies, caching directives, and various security settings. This information can help to determine a website's underlying technology stack, server-side security measures, potential vulnerabilities, and general operational practices.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [HTTP Headers - Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)\n- [RFC-7231 Section 7 - Headers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-7)\n- [List of header response fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields)\n- [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Quality Metrics</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Kqg8rx7/wc-quality.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nUsing Lighthouse, the Quality Metrics task measures the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO of the target website. This returns a simple checklist of 100 core metrics, along with a score for each category, to gauge the overall quality of a given site.\n\n###### Use Cases\nUseful for assessing a site's technical health, SEO issues, identify vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with standards.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [Lighthouse Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/)\n- [Google Page Speed Tools](https://developers.google.com/speed)\n- [W3 Accessibility Tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/)\n- [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)\n- [SEO Checker](https://www.seobility.net/en/seocheck/)\n- [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Server Location</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/cXH2hfR/wc-location.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThe Server Location task determines the physical location of the server hosting a given website based on its IP address. This is done by looking up the IP in a location database, which maps the IP to a lat + long of known data centers and ISPs. From the latitude and longitude, it's then possible to show additional contextual info, like a pin on the map, along with address, flag, time zone, currency, etc.\n\n###### Use Cases\nKnowing the server location is a good first step in better understanding a website. For site owners this aids in optimizing content delivery, ensuring compliance with data residency requirements, and identifying potential latency issues that may impact user experience in specific geographical regions. And for security researcher, assess the risk posed by specific regions or jurisdictions regarding cyber threats and regulations.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [IP Locator](https://geobytes.com/iplocator/)\n- [Internet Geolocation - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geolocation)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Associated Hosts</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/25j1sT7/wc-hosts.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task involves identifying and listing all domains and subdomains (hostnames) that are associated with the website's primary domain. This process often involves DNS enumeration to discover any linked domains and hostnames, as well as looking at known DNS records.\n\n###### Use Cases\nDuring an investigation, understanding the full scope of a target's web presence is critical. Associated domains could lead to uncovering related projects, backup sites, development/test sites, or services linked to the main site. These can sometimes provide additional information or potential security vulnerabilities. A comprehensive list of associated domains and hostnames can also give an overview of the organization's structure and online footprint.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [DNS Enumeration - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_enumeration)\n- [OWASP - Enumerate Applications on Webserver](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/04-Enumerate_Applications_on_Webserver)\n- [DNS Enumeration - DNS Dumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/)\n- [Subdomain Finder](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Redirect Chain</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/hVVrmwh/wc-redirects.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task traces the sequence of HTTP redirects that occur from the original URL to the final destination URL. An HTTP redirect is a response with a status code that advises the client to go to another URL. Redirects can occur for several reasons, such as URL normalization (directing to the www version of the site), enforcing HTTPS, URL shorteners, or forwarding users to a new site location.\n\n###### Use Cases\nUnderstanding the redirect chain can be useful for several reasons. From a security perspective, long or complicated redirect chains can be a sign of potential security risks, such as unencrypted redirects in the chain. Additionally, redirects can impact website performance and SEO, as each redirect introduces additional round-trip-time (RTT). For OSINT, understanding the redirect chain can help identify relationships between different domains or reveal the use of certain technologies or hosting providers.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [HTTP Redirects - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections)\n- [URL Redirection - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection)\n- [301 Redirects explained](https://ahrefs.com/blog/301-redirects/)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>TXT Records</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/wyt21QN/wc-txt-records.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nTXT records are a type of DNS record that provides text information to sources outside your domain. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as verifying domain ownership, ensuring email security, and even preventing unauthorized changes to your website.\n\n###### Use Cases\nThe TXT records often reveal which external services and technologies are being used with a given domain. They may reveal details about the domain's email configuration, the use of specific services like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, or security measures in place such as SPF and DKIM. Understanding these details can give an insight into the technologies used by the organization, their email security practices, and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [TXT Records (via Cloudflare Learning)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-txt-record/)\n- [TXT Records - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record)\n- [RFC-1464 - TXT Records](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1464)\n- [TXT Record Lookup (via MxToolbox)](https://mxtoolbox.com/TXTLookup.aspx)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Server Status</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/V9CNLBK/wc-status.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nChecks if a server is online and responding to requests.\n\n###### Use Cases\n\n\n###### Useful Links\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Open Ports</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/F8D1hmf/wc-ports.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nOpen ports on a server are endpoints of communication which are available for establishing connections with clients. Each port corresponds to a specific service or protocol, such as HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21), etc. The open ports on a server can be determined using techniques such as port scanning.\n\n###### Use Cases\nKnowing which ports are open on a server can provide information about the services running on that server, useful for understanding the potential vulnerabilities of the system, or for understanding the nature of the services the server is providing.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [List of TCP & UDP Port Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)\n- [NMAP - Port Scanning Basics](https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-basics.html)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Traceroute</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/M59qgxP/wc-trace-route.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nTraceroute is a network diagnostic tool used to track in real-time the pathway taken by a packet of information from one system to another. It records each hop along the route, providing details about the IPs of routers and the delay at each point.\n\n###### Use Cases\nIn OSINT investigations, traceroute can provide insights about the routing paths and geography of the network infrastructure supporting a website or service. This can help to identify network bottlenecks, potential censorship or manipulation of network traffic, and give an overall sense of the network's structure and efficiency. Additionally, the IP addresses collected during the traceroute may provide additional points of inquiry for further OSINT investigation.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Carbon Footprint</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/5v6fSyw/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-19-07-50.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task calculates the estimated carbon footprint of a website. It's based on the amount of data being transferred and processed, and the energy usage of the servers that host and deliver the website. The larger the website and the more complex its features, the higher its carbon footprint is likely to be.\n\n###### Use Cases\nFrom an OSINT perspective, understanding a website's carbon footprint doesn't directly provide insights into its internal workings or the organization behind it. However, it can still be valuable data in broader analyses, especially in contexts where environmental impact is a consideration. For example, it can be useful for activists, researchers, or ethical hackers who are interested in the sustainability of digital infrastructure, and who want to hold organizations accountable for their environmental impact.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [WebsiteCarbon - Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/)\n- [The Green Web Foundation](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/)\n- [The Eco Friendly Web Alliance](https://ecofriendlyweb.org/)\n- [Reset.org](https://en.reset.org/)\n- [Your website is killing the planet - via Wired](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-carbon-footprint)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Server Info</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Mk1jx32/wc-server.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task retrieves various pieces of information about the server hosting the target website. This can include the server type (e.g., Apache, Nginx), the hosting provider, the Autonomous System Number (ASN), and more. The information is usually obtained through a combination of IP address lookups and analysis of HTTP response headers.\n\n###### Use Cases\nIn an OSINT context, server information can provide valuable clues about the organization behind a website. For instance, the choice of hosting provider could suggest the geographical region in which the organization operates, while the server type could hint at the technologies used by the organization. The ASN could also be used to find other domains hosted by the same organization.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Whois Lookup</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/89WLp14/wc-domain.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis task retrieves Whois records for the target domain.

This is because the DNS system includes no built-in methods to verify that the response to the request was not forged, or that any other part of the process wasn’t interrupted by an attacker. The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) secures DNS lookups by signing your DNS records using public keys, so browsers can detect if the response has been tampered with. Another solution to this issue is DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLD).\n\n###### Use Cases\nDNSSEC information provides insight into an organization's level of cybersecurity maturity and potential vulnerabilities, particularly around DNS spoofing and cache poisoning. If no DNS secururity (DNSSEC, DoH, DoT, etc) is implemented, this may provide an entry point for an attacker.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Site Features</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/gP4P6kp/wc-features.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nChecks which core features are present on a site.

A website can be included in the HSTS preload list by conforming to a set of requirements and then submitting itself to the list.\n\n###### Use Cases\nThere are several reasons why it's important for a site to be HSTS enabled:\n      1. User bookmarks or manually types http://example.com and is subject to a man-in-the-middle attacker\n        HSTS automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS for the target domain\n      2. Web application that is intended to be purely HTTPS inadvertently contains HTTP links or serves content over HTTP\n        HSTS automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS for the target domain\n      3. A man-in-the-middle attacker attempts to intercept traffic from a victim user using an invalid certificate and hopes the user will accept the bad certificate\n        HSTS does not allow a user to override the invalid certificate message\n        \n\n###### Useful Links\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n- [undefined](function link() { [native code] })\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>DNS Server</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/tKpL8F9/Screenshot-from-2023-08-12-15-43-12.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nThis check determines the DNS server(s) that the requested URL / IP resolves to.

It allows domain owners to specify how to handle unauthenticated mail via a published policy in DNS, and provides a way for receiving mail servers to send feedback about emails' compliance to the sender. BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification): BIMI is an emerging email standard that enables organizations to display a logo in their customers' email clients automatically. BIMI ties the logo to the domain's DMARC record, providing another level of visual assurance to recipients that the email is legitimate. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): DKIM is an email security standard designed to make sure that messages were not altered in transit between the sending and recipient servers. It uses digital signatures linked to the domain of the sender to verify the sender and ensure message integrity. SPF (Sender Policy Framework): SPF is an email authentication method designed to prevent email spoofing. It specifies which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of a domain by creating a DNS record. This helps protect against spam by providing a way for receiving mail servers to check that incoming mail from a domain comes from a host authorized by that domain's administrators.\n\n###### Use Cases\nThis information is helpful for researchers as it helps assess a domain's email security posture, uncover potential vulnerabilities, and verify the legitimacy of emails for phishing detection. These details can also provide insight into the hosting environment, potential service providers, and the configuration patterns of a target organization, assisting in investigative efforts.\n\n###### Useful Links\n- [Intro to DMARC, DKIM, and SPF (via Cloudflare)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/)\n- [EasyDMARC Domain Scanner](https://easydmarc.com/tools/domain-scanner)\n- [MX Toolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/)\n- [RFC-7208 - SPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208)\n- [RFC-6376 - DKIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376)\n- [RFC-7489 - DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489)\n- [BIMI Group](https://bimigroup.org/)\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary><b>Firewall Detection</b></summary>\n\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/MfcxQt2/Screenshot-from-2023-08-12-15-40-52.png\" align=\"right\" />\n\n###### Description\nA WAF or web application firewall helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet.

Either put them directly into an `.env` file in the projects root, or via the Netlify / Vercel UI, or by passing to the Docker container with the --env flag, or using your own environmental variable management system\n\nNote that keys that are prefixed with `REACT_APP_` are used client-side, and as such they must be scoped correctly with minimum privileges, since may be made visible when intercepting browser <-> server network requests\n\n---\n\n### Developing\n\n1. Clone the repo, `git clone git@github.com:Lissy93/web-check.git`\n2. Cd into it, `cd web-check`\n3. Install dependencies: `yarn`\n4. Start the dev server, with `yarn dev`\n\nYou'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (V 18.16.1 or later) installed, plus [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) as well as [git](https://git-scm.com/).\nSome checks also require `chromium`, `traceroute` and `dns` to be installed within your environment. These jobs will just be skipped if those packages aren't present.\n\n\n---\n\n## Community\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions of any kind are very welcome, and would be much appreciated.\nFor Code of Conduct, see [Contributor Convent](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).\n\nTo get started, fork the repo, make your changes, add, commit and push the code, then come back here to open a pull request. If you're new to GitHub or open source, [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3#let-s-make-our-first-pull-request-) or the [git docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) may help you get started, but feel free to

will remain 100% free and open source.\nBut due to the amount of traffic that the hosted instance gets, the lambda function usage is costing about $25/month.\nAny help with covering the costs via GitHub Sponsorship would be much appreciated.\nIt's thanks to the support of the community that this project is able to be freely available for everyone :)\n\n[![Sponsor Lissy93 on

This enables Claude to maintain continuity of knowledge about projects even after sessions end or reconnect.\n</p>\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\nStart a new Claude Code session in the terminal and enter the following commands:\n\n```\n> /plugin marketplace add thedotmack/claude-mem\n\n> /plugin install claude-mem\n```\n\nRestart Claude Code. Context from previous sessions will automatically appear in new sessions.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- 🧠 **Persistent Memory** - Context survives across sessions\n- 📊 **Progressive Disclosure** - Layered memory retrieval with token cost visibility\n- 🔍 **Skill-Based Search** - Query your project history with mem-search skill\n- 🖥️ **Web Viewer UI** - Real-time memory stream at http://localhost:37777\n- 💻 **Claude Desktop Skill** - Search memory from Claude Desktop conversations\n- 🔒 **Privacy Control** - Use `<private>` tags to exclude sensitive content from storage\n- ⚙️ **Context Configuration** - Fine-grained control over what context gets injected\n- 🤖 **Automatic Operation** - No manual intervention required\n- 🔗 **Citations** - Reference past observations with IDs (access via http://localhost:37777/api/observation/{id} or view all in the web viewer at http://localhost:37777)\n- 🧪 **Beta Channel** - Try experimental features like Endless Mode via version switching\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\n📚 **[View Full Documentation](docs/)** - Browse markdown docs on GitHub\n\n### Getting Started\n\n- **[Installation Guide](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/installation)** - Quick start & advanced installation\n- **[Usage Guide](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/usage/getting-started)** - How Claude-Mem works automatically\n- **[Search Tools](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/usage/search-tools)** - Query your project history with natural language\n- **[Beta Features](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/beta-features)** - Try experimental features like Endless Mode\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **[Context Engineering](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/context-engineering)** - AI agent context optimization principles\n- **[Progressive Disclosure](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/progressive-disclosure)** - Philosophy behind Claude-Mem's context priming strategy\n\n### Architecture\n\n- **[Overview](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/architecture/overview)** - System components & data flow\n- **[Architecture Evolution](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/architecture-evolution)** - The journey from v3 to v5\n- **[Hooks Architecture](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/hooks-architecture)** - How Claude-Mem uses lifecycle hooks\n- **[Hooks Reference](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/architecture/hooks)** - 7 hook scripts explained\n- **[Worker Service](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/architecture/worker-service)** - HTTP API & Bun management\n- **[Database](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/architecture/database)** - SQLite schema & FTS5 search\n- **[Search Architecture](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/architecture/search-architecture)** - Hybrid search with Chroma vector database\n\n### Configuration & Development\n\n- **[Configuration](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/configuration)** - Environment variables & settings\n- **[Development](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/development)** - Building, testing, contributing\n- **[Troubleshooting](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/troubleshooting)** - Common issues & solutions\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n**Core Components:**\n\n1. **5 Lifecycle Hooks** - SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Stop, SessionEnd (6 hook scripts)\n2. **Smart Install** - Cached dependency checker (pre-hook script, not a lifecycle hook)\n3. **Worker Service** - HTTP API on port 37777 with web viewer UI and 10 search endpoints, managed by Bun\n4. **SQLite Database** - Stores sessions, observations, summaries\n5. **mem-search Skill** - Natural language queries with progressive disclosure\n6. **Chroma Vector Database** - Hybrid semantic + keyword search for intelligent context retrieval\n\nSee [Architecture Overview](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/architecture/overview) for details.\n\n---\n\n## MCP Search Tools\n\nClaude-Mem provides intelligent memory search through **4 MCP tools** following a token-efficient **3-layer workflow pattern**:\n\n**The 3-Layer Workflow:**\n\n1. **`search`** - Get compact index with IDs (~50-100 tokens/result)\n2. **`timeline`** - Get chronological context around interesting results\n3. **`get_observations`** - Fetch full details ONLY for filtered IDs (~500-1,000 tokens/result)\n\n**How It Works:**\n- Claude uses MCP tools to search your memory\n- Start with `search` to get an index of results\n- Use `timeline` to see what was happening around specific observations\n- Use `get_observations` to fetch full details for relevant IDs\n- **~10x token savings** by filtering before fetching details\n\n**Available MCP Tools:**\n\n1. **`search`** - Search memory index with full-text queries, filters by type/date/project\n2. **`timeline`** - Get chronological context around a specific observation or query\n3. **`get_observations`** - Fetch full observation details by IDs (always batch multiple IDs)\n4. **`__IMPORTANT`** - Workflow documentation (always visible to Claude)\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```typescript\n// Step 1: Search for index\nsearch(query=\"authentication bug\", type=\"bugfix\", limit=10)\n\n// Step 2: Review index, identify relevant IDs (e.g., #123, #456)\n\n// Step 3: Fetch full details\nget_observations(ids=[123, 456])\n```\n\nSee [Search Tools Guide](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/usage/search-tools) for detailed examples.\n\n---\n\n## Beta Features\n\nClaude-Mem offers a **beta channel** with experimental features like **Endless Mode** (biomimetic memory architecture for extended sessions). Switch between stable and beta versions from the web viewer UI at http://localhost:37777 → Settings.\n\nSee **[Beta Features Documentation](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/beta-features)** for details on Endless Mode and how to try it.\n\n---\n\n## System Requirements\n\n- **Node.js**: 18.0.0 or higher\n- **Claude Code**: Latest version with plugin support\n- **Bun**: JavaScript runtime and process manager (auto-installed if missing)\n- **uv**: Python package manager for vector search (auto-installed if missing)\n- **SQLite 3**: For persistent storage (bundled)\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are managed in `~/.claude-mem/settings.json` (auto-created with defaults on first run). Configure AI model, worker port, data directory, log level, and context injection settings.\n\nSee the **[Configuration Guide](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/configuration)** for all available settings and examples.\n\n---\n\n## Development\n\nSee the **[Development Guide](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/development)** for build instructions, testing, and contribution workflow.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf experiencing issues, describe the problem to Claude and the troubleshoot skill will automatically diagnose and provide fixes.\n\nSee the **[Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/troubleshooting)** for common issues and solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Bug Reports\n\nCreate comprehensive bug reports with the automated generator:\n\n```bash\ncd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack\nnpm run bug-report\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

You can do anything you\nwant with them. You have no legal obligation\nto do anything else, although I appreciate attribution.\n\nThey are also licensed under the MIT open source license, if you have lawyers\nwho are unhappy with public domain. Every source file includes an explicit\ndual-license for you to choose from.\n\n#### How do I use these libraries?\n\nThe idea behind single-header file libraries is that they're easy to distribute and deploy\nbecause all the code is contained in a single file. By default, the .h files in here act as\ntheir own header files, i.e. they declare the functions contained in the file but don't\nactually result in any code getting compiled.\n\nSo in addition, you should select _exactly one_ C/C++ source file that actually instantiates\nthe code, preferably a file you're not editing frequently. This file should define a\nspecific macro (this is documented per-library) to actually enable the function definitions.\nFor example, to use stb_image, you should have exactly one C/C++ file that doesn't\ninclude stb_image.h regularly, but instead does\n\n    #define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION\n    #include \"stb_image.h\"\n\nThe right macro to define is pointed out right at the top of each of these libraries.\n\n#### <a name=\"other_libs\"></a> Are there other single-file public-domain/open source libraries with minimal dependencies out there?\n\n[Yes.](https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs)\n\n#### If I wrap an stb library in a new library, does the new library have to be public domain/MIT?\n\nNo, because it's public domain you can freely relicense it to whatever license your new\nlibrary wants to be.\n\n#### What's the deal with SSE support in GCC-based compilers?\n\nstb_image will either use SSE2 (if you compile with -msse2) or\nwill not use any SIMD at all, rather than trying to detect the\nprocessor at runtime and handle it correctly. As I understand it,\nthe approved path in GCC for runtime-detection require\nyou to use multiple source files, one for each CPU configuration.\nBecause stb_image is a header-file library that compiles in only\none source file, there's no approved way to build both an\nSSE-enabled and a non-SSE-enabled variation.\n\nWhile we've tried to work around it, we've had multiple issues over\nthe years due to specific versions of gcc breaking what we're doing,\nso we've given up on it. See https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/280\nand https://github.com/nothings/stb/issues/410 for examples.\n\n#### Some of these libraries seem redundant to existing open source libraries. Are they better somehow?\n\nGenerally they're only better in that they're easier to integrate,\neasier to use, and easier to release (single file; good API; no\nattribution requirement). They may be less featureful, slower,\nand/or use more memory. If you're already using an equivalent\nlibrary, there's probably no good reason to switch.\n\n#### Can I link directly to the table of stb libraries?\n\nYou can use [this URL](https://github.com/nothings/stb#stb_libs) to link directly to that list.\n\n#### Why do you list \"lines of code\"? It's a terrible metric.\n\nJust to give you some idea of the internal complexity of the library,\nto help you manage your expectations, or to let you know what you're\ngetting into. While not all the libraries are written in the same\nstyle, they're certainly similar styles, and so comparisons between\nthe libraries are probably still meaningful.\n\nNote though that the lines do include both the implementation, the\npart that corresponds to a header file, and the documentation.\n\n#### Why single-file headers?\n\nWindows doesn't have standard directories where libraries\nlive. That makes deploying libraries in Windows a lot more\npainful than open source developers on Unix-derivates generally\nrealize. (It also makes library dependencies a lot worse in Windows.)\n\nThere's also a common problem in Windows where a library was built\nagainst a different version of the runtime library, which causes\nlink conflicts and confusion. Shipping the libs as headers means\nyou normally just compile them straight into your project without\nmaking libraries, thus sidestepping that problem.\n\nMaking them a single file makes it very easy to just\ndrop them into a project that needs them. (Of course you can\nstill put them in a proper shared library tree if you want.)\n\nWhy not two files, one a header and one an implementation?\nThe difference between 10 files and 9 files is not a big deal,\nbut the difference between 2 files and 1 file is a big deal.\nYou don't need to zip or tar the files up, you don't have to\nremember to attach *two* files, etc.\n\n#### Why \"stb\"? Is this something to do with Set-Top Boxes?\n\nNo, they are just the initials for my name, Sean T. Barrett.\nThis was not chosen out of egomania, but as a moderately sane\nway of namespacing the filenames and source function names.\n\n#### Will you add more image types to stb_image.h?\n\nNo. As stb_image use has grown, it has become more important\nfor us to focus on security of the codebase. Adding new image\nformats increases the amount of code we need to secure, so it\nis no longer worth adding new formats.\n\n#### Do you have any advice on how to create my own single-file library?\n\nYes. https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt\n\n#### Why public domain?\n\nI prefer it over GPL, LGPL, BSD, zlib, etc. for many reasons.\nSome of them are listed here:\nhttps://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/why_public_domain.md\n\n#### Why C?\n\nPrimarily, because I use C, not C++. But it does also make it easier\nfor other people to use them from other languages.\n\n#### Why not C99? stdint.h, declare-anywhere, etc.\n\nI still use MSVC 6 (1998) as my IDE because it has better human factors\nfor me than later versions of MSVC.\n",

Because it's model-agnostic, multi-modal, and works fully offline, developers are using Memvid across a wide range of real-world applications.\n\n- Long-Running AI Agents\n- Enterprise Knowledge Bases\n- Offline-First AI Systems\n- Codebase Understanding\n- Customer Support Agents\n- Workflow Automation\n- Sales and Marketing Copilots\n- Personal Knowledge Assistants\n- Medical, Legal, and Financial Agents\n- Auditable and Debuggable AI Workflows\n- Custom Applications\n\n---\n\n## SDKs & CLI\n\nUse Memvid in your preferred language:\n\n| Package | Install | Links

`useProviderActions` - Provider operations\n  - `useMcpActions` - MCP management\n  - `useSettings` series - Settings management\n  - `useImportExport` - Import/export\n- Integration tests\n  - App main application flow\n  - SettingsDialog complete interaction\n  - MCP panel functionality\n\n**Running Tests**:\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests\npnpm test:unit\n\n# Watch mode (auto re-run)\npnpm test:unit:watch\n\n# With coverage report\npnpm test:unit --coverage\n```\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend**: React 18 · TypeScript · Vite · TailwindCSS 4 · TanStack Query v5 · react-i18next · react-hook-form · zod · shadcn/ui · @dnd-kit\n\n**Backend**: Tauri 2.8 · Rust · serde · tokio · thiserror · tauri-plugin-updater/process/dialog/store/log\n\n**Testing**: vitest · MSW · @testing-library/react\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\n├── src/                      # Frontend (React + TypeScript)\n│   ├── components/           # UI components (providers/settings/mcp/ui)\n│   ├── hooks/                # Custom hooks (business logic)\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   ├── api/              # Tauri API wrapper (type-safe)\n│   │   └── query/            # TanStack Query config\n│   ├── i18n/locales/         # Translations (zh/en)\n│   ├── config/               # Presets (providers/mcp)\n│   └── types/                # TypeScript definitions\n├── src-tauri/                # Backend (Rust)\n│   └── src/\n│       ├── commands/         # Tauri command layer (by domain)\n│       ├── services/         # Business logic layer\n│       ├── app_config.rs     # Config data models\n│       ├── provider.rs       # Provider domain models\n│       ├── mcp.rs            # MCP sync & validation\n│       └── lib.rs            # App entry & tray menu\n├── tests/                    # Frontend tests\n│   ├── hooks/                # Unit tests\n│   └── components/           # Integration tests\n└── assets/                   # Screenshots & partner resources\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version update details.\n\n## Legacy Electron Version\n\n[Releases](../../releases) retains v2.0.3 legacy Electron version\n\nIf you need legacy Electron code, you can pull the electron-legacy branch\n\n## Contributing\n\nIssues and suggestions are welcome!\n\nBefore submitting PRs, please ensure:\n\n- Pass type check: `pnpm typecheck`\n- Pass format check: `pnpm format:check`\n- Pass unit tests: `pnpm test:unit`\n- 💡 For new features, please open an issue for discussion before submitting a PR\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=farion1231/cc-switch&type=Date)](https://www.star-history.com/#farion1231/cc-switch&Date)\n\n## License\n\nMIT © Jason Young\n",

      "readme": "# Chrome DevTools MCP\n\n[![npm chrome-devtools-mcp package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/chrome-devtools-mcp.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/chrome-devtools-mcp)\n\n`chrome-devtools-mcp` lets your coding agent (such as Gemini, Claude, Cursor or Copilot)\ncontrol and inspect a live Chrome browser. It acts as a Model-Context-Protocol\n(MCP) server, giving your AI coding assistant access to the full power of\nChrome DevTools for reliable automation, in-depth debugging, and performance analysis.\n\n## [Tool reference](./docs/tool-reference.md) | [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) | [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) | [Troubleshooting](./docs/troubleshooting.md) | [Design Principles](./docs/design-principles.md)\n\n## Key features\n\n- **Get performance insights**: Uses [Chrome\n  DevTools](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-frontend) to record\n  traces and extract actionable performance insights.\n- **Advanced browser debugging**: Analyze network requests, take screenshots and\n  check the browser console.\n- **Reliable automation**. Uses\n  [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to automate actions in\n  Chrome and automatically wait for action results.\n\n## Disclaimers\n\n`chrome-devtools-mcp` exposes content of the browser instance to the MCP clients\nallowing them to inspect, debug, and modify any data in the browser or DevTools.\nAvoid sharing sensitive or personal information that you don't want to share with\nMCP clients.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20.19 or a newer [latest maintenance LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) version.\n- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) current stable version or newer.\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).\n\n## Getting started\n\nAdd the following config to your MCP client:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Using `chrome-devtools-mcp@latest` ensures that your MCP client will always use the latest version of the Chrome DevTools MCP server.\n\n### MCP Client configuration\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Amp</summary>\n  Follow https://ampcode.com/manual#mcp and use the config provided above. You can also install the Chrome DevTools MCP server using the CLI:\n\n```bash\namp mcp add chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Antigravity</summary>\n\nTo use the Chrome DevTools MCP server follow the instructions from <a href=\"https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp\">Antigravity's docs<a/> to install a custom MCP server. Add the following config to the MCP servers config:\n\n```bash\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\",\n        \"--browser-url=http://127.0.0.1:9222\",\n        \"-y\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will make the Chrome DevTools MCP server automatically connect to the browser that Antigravity is using. If you are not using port 9222, make sure to adjust accordingly.\n\nChrome DevTools MCP will not start the browser instance automatically using this approach as as the Chrome DevTools MCP server runs in Antigravity's built-in browser. If the browser is not already running, you have to start it first by clicking the Chrome icon at the top right corner.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Claude Code</summary>\n    Use the Claude Code CLI to add the Chrome DevTools MCP server (<a href=\"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp\">guide</a>):\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add chrome-devtools npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Cline</summary>\n  Follow https://docs.cline.bot/mcp/configuring-mcp-servers and use the config provided above.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Codex</summary>\n  Follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/advanced.md#model-context-protocol-mcp\">configure MCP guide</a>\n  using the standard config from above. You can also install the Chrome DevTools MCP server using the Codex CLI:\n\n```bash\ncodex mcp add chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\n```\n\n**On Windows 11**\n\nConfigure the Chrome install location and increase the startup timeout by updating `.codex/config.toml` and adding the following `env` and `startup_timeout_ms` parameters:\n\n```\n[mcp_servers.chrome-devtools]\ncommand = \"cmd\"\nargs = [\n    \"/c\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"-y\",\n    \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\",\n]\nenv = { SystemRoot=\"C:\\\\Windows\", PROGRAMFILES=\"C:\\\\Program Files\" }\nstartup_timeout_ms = 20_000\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Copilot CLI</summary>\n\nStart Copilot CLI:\n\n```\ncopilot\n```\n\nStart the dialog to add a new MCP server by running:\n\n```\n/mcp add\n```\n\nConfigure the following fields and press `CTRL+S` to save the configuration:\n\n- **Server name:** `chrome-devtools`\n- **Server Type:** `[1] Local`\n- **Command:** `npx -y chrome-devtools-mcp@latest`\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Copilot / VS Code</summary>\n\n**Click the button to install:**\n\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF\" alt=\"Install in VS Code\">](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=io.github.ChromeDevTools%2Fchrome-devtools-mcp&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22chrome-devtools-mcp%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%7D%7D)\n\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5\" alt=\"Install in VS Code Insiders\">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode-insiders%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522io.github.ChromeDevTools%252Fchrome-devtools-mcp%2522%252C%2522config%2522%253A%257B%2522command%2522%253A%2522npx%2522%252C%2522args%2522%253A%255B%2522-y%2522%252C%2522chrome-devtools-mcp%2522%255D%252C%2522env%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%257D)\n\n**Or install manually:**\n\nFollow the MCP install <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server\">guide</a>,\nwith the standard config from above.

For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\",\n        \"--channel=canary\",\n        \"--headless=true\",\n        \"--isolated=true\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Connecting via WebSocket with custom headers\n\nYou can connect directly to a Chrome WebSocket endpoint and include custom headers (e.g., for authentication):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\",\n        \"--wsEndpoint=ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/<id>\",\n        \"--wsHeaders={\\\"Authorization\\\":\\\"Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\\\"}\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo get the WebSocket endpoint from a running Chrome instance, visit `http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version` and look for the `webSocketDebuggerUrl` field.\n\nYou can also run `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --help` to see all available configuration options.\n\n## Concepts\n\n### User data directory\n\n`chrome-devtools-mcp` starts a Chrome's stable channel instance using the following user\ndata directory:\n\n- Linux / macOS: `$HOME/.cache/chrome-devtools-mcp/chrome-profile-$CHANNEL`\n- Windows: `%HOMEPATH%/.cache/chrome-devtools-mcp/chrome-profile-$CHANNEL`\n\nThe user data directory is not cleared between runs and shared across\nall instances of `chrome-devtools-mcp`. Set the `isolated` option to `true`\nto use a temporary user data dir instead which will be cleared automatically after\nthe browser is closed.\n\n### Connecting to a running Chrome instance\n\nBy default, the Chrome DevTools MCP server will start a new Chrome instance with a dedicated profile. This might not be ideal in all situations:\n\n- If you would like to maintain the same application state when alternating between manual site testing and agent-driven testing.\n- When the MCP needs to sign into a website. Some accounts may prevent sign-in when the browser is controlled via WebDriver (the default launch mechanism for the Chrome DevTools MCP server).\n- If you're running your LLM inside a sandboxed environment, but you would like to connect to a Chrome instance that runs outside the sandbox.\n\nIn these cases, start Chrome first and let the Chrome DevTools MCP server connect to it. There are two ways to do so:\n\n- **Automatic connection (available in Chrome 144)**: best for sharing state between manual and agent-driven testing.\n- **Manual connection via remote debugging port**: best when running inside a sandboxed environment.\n\n#### Automatically connecting to a running Chrome instance\n\n**Step 1:** Set up remote debugging in Chrome\n\nIn Chrome (\\>= M144), do the following to set up remote debugging:\n\n1.  Navigate to `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` to enable remote debugging.\n2.  Follow the dialog UI to allow or disallow incoming debugging connections.\n\n**Step 2:** Configure Chrome DevTools MCP server to automatically connect to a running Chrome Instance\n\nTo connect the `chrome-devtools-mcp` server to the running Chrome instance, use\n`--autoConnect` command line argument for the MCP server.\n\nThe following code snippet is an example configuration for gemini-cli:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\", \"--autoConnect\", \"--channel=beta\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: you have to specify `--channel=beta` until Chrome M144 has reached the\nstable channel.\n\n**Step 3:** Test your setup\n\nMake sure your browser is running. Open gemini-cli and run the following prompt:\n\n```none\nCheck the performance of https://developers.chrome.com\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> The <code>autoConnect</code> option requires the user to start Chrome. If the user has multiple active profiles, the MCP server will connect to the default profile (as determined by Chrome). The MCP server has access to all open windows for the selected profile.\n\nThe Chrome DevTools MCP server will try to connect to your running Chrome\ninstance. It shows a dialog asking for user permission.\n\nClicking **Allow** results in the Chrome DevTools MCP server opening\n[developers.chrome.com](http://developers.chrome.com) and taking a performance\ntrace.\n\n#### Manual connection using port forwarding\n\nYou can connect to a running Chrome instance by using the `--browser-url` option. This is useful if you are running the MCP server in a sandboxed environment that does not allow starting a new Chrome instance.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide on how to connect to a running Chrome instance:\n\n**Step 1: Configure the MCP client**\n\nAdd the `--browser-url` option to your MCP client configuration. The value of this option should be the URL of the running Chrome instance. `http://127.0.0.1:9222` is a common default.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\",\n        \"--browser-url=http://127.0.0.1:9222\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Start the Chrome browser**\n\n> [!WARNING]  \n> Enabling the remote debugging port opens up a debugging port on the running browser instance. Any application on your machine can connect to this port and control the browser. Make sure that you are not browsing any sensitive websites while the debugging port is open.\n\nStart the Chrome browser with the remote debugging port enabled. Make sure to close any running Chrome instances before starting a new one with the debugging port enabled. The port number you choose must be the same as the one you specified in the `--browser-url` option in your MCP client configuration.\n\nFor security reasons, [Chrome requires you to use a non-default user data directory](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/remote-debugging-port) when enabling the remote debugging port. You can specify a custom directory using the `--user-data-dir` flag. This ensures that your regular browsing profile and data are not exposed to the debugging session.\n\n**macOS**\n\n```bash\n/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-profile-stable\n```\n\n**Linux**\n\n```bash\n/usr/bin/google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-profile-stable\n```\n\n**Windows**\n\n```bash\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=\"%TEMP%\\chrome-profile-stable\"\n```\n\n**Step 3: Test your setup**\n\nAfter configuring the MCP client and starting the Chrome browser, you can test your setup by running a simple prompt in your MCP client:\n\n```\nCheck the performance of https://developers.chrome.com\n```\n\nYour MCP client should connect to the running Chrome instance and receive a performance report.\n\nIf you hit VM-to-host port forwarding issues, see the “Remote debugging between virtual machine (VM) and host fails” section in [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](./docs/troubleshooting.md#remote-debugging-between-virtual-machine-vm-and-host-fails).\n\nFor more details on remote debugging, see the [Chrome DevTools documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging/).\n\n## Known limitations\n\n### Operating system sandboxes\n\nSome MCP clients allow sandboxing the MCP server using macOS Seatbelt or Linux\ncontainers. If sandboxes are enabled, `chrome-devtools-mcp` is not able to start\nChrome that requires permissions to create its own sandboxes. As a workaround,\neither disable sandboxing for `chrome-devtools-mcp` in your MCP client or use\n`--browser-url` to connect to a Chrome instance that you start manually outside\nof the MCP client sandbox.\n",

      "readme": "Protocol Buffers - Google's data interchange format\n===================================================\n\n[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)\n\nCopyright 2008 Google LLC\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nProtocol Buffers (a.k.a., protobuf) are Google's language-neutral,\nplatform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. You\ncan learn more about it in [protobuf's documentation](https://protobuf.dev).\n\nThis README file contains protobuf installation instructions. To install\nprotobuf, you need to install the protocol compiler (used to compile .proto\nfiles) and the protobuf runtime for your chosen programming language.\n\nWorking With Protobuf Source Code\n---------------------------------\n\nMost users will find working from\n[supported releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) to be\nthe easiest path.\n\nIf you choose to work from the head revision of the main branch your build will\noccasionally be broken by source-incompatible changes and insufficiently-tested\n(and therefore broken) behavior.\n\nIf you are using C++ or otherwise need to build protobuf from source as a part\nof your project, you should pin to a release commit on a release branch.\n\nThis is because even release branches can experience some instability in between\nrelease commits.\n\n### Bazel with Bzlmod\n\nProtobuf supports\n[Bzlmod](https://bazel.build/external/module) with Bazel 7 +.\nUsers should specify a dependency on protobuf in their MODULE.bazel file as\nfollows.\n\n```\nbazel_dep(name = \"protobuf\", version = <VERSION>)\n```\n\nUsers can optionally override the repo name, such as for compatibility with\nWORKSPACE.\n\n```\nbazel_dep(name = \"protobuf\", version = <VERSION>, repo_name = \"com_google_protobuf\")\n```\n\n### Bazel with WORKSPACE\n\nUsers can also add the following to their legacy\n[WORKSPACE](https://bazel.build/external/overview#workspace-system) file.\n\nNote that with the release of 30.x there are a few more load statements to\nproperly set up rules_java and rules_python.\n\n```\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"com_google_protobuf\",\n    strip_prefix = \"protobuf-VERSION\",\n    sha256 = ...,\n    url = ...,\n)\n\nload(\"@com_google_protobuf//:protobuf_deps.bzl\", \"protobuf_deps\")\n\nprotobuf_deps()\n\nload(\"@rules_java//java:rules_java_deps.bzl\", \"rules_java_dependencies\")\n\nrules_java_dependencies()\n\nload(\"@rules_java//java:repositories.bzl\", \"rules_java_toolchains\")\n\nrules_java_toolchains()\n\nload(\"@rules_python//python:repositories.bzl\", \"py_repositories\")\n\npy_repositories()\n```\n\nProtobuf Compiler Installation\n------------------------------\n\nThe protobuf compiler is written in C++. If you are using C++, please follow\nthe [C++ Installation Instructions](src/README.md) to install protoc along\nwith the C++ runtime.\n\nFor non-C++ users, the simplest way to install the protocol compiler is to\ndownload a pre-built binary from our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases).\n\nIn the downloads section of each release, you can find pre-built binaries in\nzip packages: `protoc-$VERSION-$PLATFORM.zip`. It contains the protoc binary\nas well as a set of standard `.proto` files distributed along with protobuf.\n\nIf you are looking for an old version that is not available in the release\npage, check out the [Maven repository](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/protobuf/protoc/).\n\nThese pre-built binaries are only provided for released versions. If you want\nto use the github main version at HEAD, or you need to modify protobuf code,\nor you are using C++, it's recommended to build your own protoc binary from\nsource.\n\nIf you would like to build protoc binary from source, see the [C++ Installation Instructions](src/README.md).\n\nProtobuf Runtime Installation\n-----------------------------\n\nProtobuf supports several different programming languages. For each programming\nlanguage, you can find instructions in the corresponding source directory about\nhow to install protobuf runtime for that specific language:\n\n| Language                             | Source                                                      |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| C++ (include C++ runtime and protoc) | [src](src)                                                  |\n| Java                                 | [java](java)                                                |\n| Python                               | [python](python)                                            |\n| Objective-C                          | [objectivec](objectivec)                                    |\n| C#                                   | [csharp](csharp)                                            |\n| Ruby                                 | [ruby](ruby)                                                |\n| Go                                   | [protocolbuffers/protobuf-go](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-go)|\n| PHP                                  | [php](php)                                                  |\n| Dart                                 | [dart-lang/protobuf](https://github.com/dart-lang/protobuf) |\n| JavaScript                           | [protocolbuffers/protobuf-javascript](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-javascript)|\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nThe best way to learn how to use protobuf is to follow the [tutorials in our\ndeveloper guide](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started).\n\nIf you want to learn from code examples, take a look at the examples in the\n[examples](examples) directory.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe complete documentation is available at the [Protocol Buffers doc site](https://protobuf.dev).\n\nSupport Policy\n--------------\n\nRead about our [version support policy](https://protobuf.dev/version-support/)\nto stay current on support timeframes for the language libraries.\n\nDeveloper Community\n-------------------\n\nTo be alerted to upcoming changes in Protocol Buffers and connect with protobuf developers and users,\n[join the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/protobuf).\n",

All major desktop and mobile platforms\nare supported.\n\n\nFeatures\n========\n- Simple build system with no external dependencies.\n- Simple and flexible API.\n- Low-level API for direct access to raw audio data.\n- High-level API for sound management, mixing, effects and optional 3D spatialization.\n- Flexible node graph system for advanced mixing and effect processing.\n- Resource management for loading sound files.\n- Decoding, with built-in support for WAV, FLAC, and MP3, in addition to being able to plug in custom decoders.\n- Encoding (WAV only).\n- Data conversion.\n- Resampling, including custom resamplers.\n- Channel mapping.\n- Basic generation of waveforms and noise.\n- Basic effects and filters.\n\nRefer to the [Programming Manual](https://miniaud.io/docs/manual/) for a more complete description of\navailable features in miniaudio.\n\n\nExamples\n========\n\nThis example shows one way to play a sound using the high level API.\n\n```c\n#include \"miniaudio/miniaudio.h\"\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\n    ma_result result;\n    ma_engine engine;\n\n    result = ma_engine_init(NULL, &engine);\n    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    ma_engine_play_sound(&engine, \"sound.wav\", NULL);\n\n    printf(\"Press Enter to quit...\");\n    getchar();\n\n    ma_engine_uninit(&engine);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis example shows how to decode and play a sound using the low level API.\n\n```c\n#include \"miniaudio/miniaudio.h\"\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nvoid data_callback(ma_device* pDevice, void* pOutput, const void* pInput, ma_uint32 frameCount)\n{\n    ma_decoder* pDecoder = (ma_decoder*)pDevice->pUserData;\n    if (pDecoder == NULL) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    ma_decoder_read_pcm_frames(pDecoder, pOutput, frameCount, NULL);\n\n    (void)pInput;\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv)\n{\n    ma_result result;\n    ma_decoder decoder;\n    ma_device_config deviceConfig;\n    ma_device device;\n\n    if (argc < 2) {\n        printf(\"No input file.\\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    result = ma_decoder_init_file(argv[1], NULL, &decoder);\n    if (result != MA_SUCCESS) {\n        return -2;\n    }\n\n    deviceConfig = ma_device_config_init(ma_device_type_playback);\n    deviceConfig.playback.format   = decoder.outputFormat;\n    deviceConfig.playback.channels = decoder.outputChannels;\n    deviceConfig.sampleRate        = decoder.outputSampleRate;\n    deviceConfig.dataCallback      = data_callback;\n    deviceConfig.pUserData         = &decoder;\n\n    if (ma_device_init(NULL, &deviceConfig, &device) != MA_SUCCESS) {\n        printf(\"Failed to open playback device.\\n\");\n        ma_decoder_uninit(&decoder);\n        return -3;\n    }\n\n    if (ma_device_start(&device) != MA_SUCCESS) {\n        printf(\"Failed to start playback device.\\n\");\n        ma_device_uninit(&device);\n        ma_decoder_uninit(&decoder);\n        return -4;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Press Enter to quit...\");\n    getchar();\n\n    ma_device_uninit(&device);\n    ma_decoder_uninit(&decoder);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nMore examples can be found in the [examples](examples) folder or online here: https://miniaud.io/docs/examples/\n\n\nBuilding\n========\nJust compile miniaudio.c like any other source file and include miniaudio.h like a normal header. There's no need\nto install any dependencies. On Windows and macOS there's no need to link to anything. On Linux and BSD just link\nto `-lpthread` and `-lm`. On iOS you need to compile as Objective-C. Link to `-ldl` if you get errors about\n`dlopen()`, etc.\n\nIf you get errors about undefined references to `__sync_val_compare_and_swap_8`, `__atomic_load_8`, etc. you\nneed to link with `-latomic`.\n\nABI compatibility is not guaranteed between versions so take care if compiling as a DLL/SO. The suggested way\nto integrate miniaudio is by adding it directly to your source tree.\n\nYou can also use CMake if that's your preference.\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\nOnline documentation can be found here: https://miniaud.io/docs/\n\nDocumentation can also be found at the top of [miniaudio.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mackron/miniaudio/master/miniaudio.h)\nwhich is always the most up-to-date and authoritative source of information on how to use miniaudio. All other\ndocumentation is generated from this in-code documentation.\n\n\nSupported Platforms\n===================\n- Windows\n- macOS, iOS\n- Linux\n- FreeBSD / OpenBSD / NetBSD\n- Android\n- Raspberry Pi\n- Emscripten / HTML5\n\nminiaudio should compile clean on other platforms, but it will not include any support for playback or capture\nby default. To support that, you would need to implement a custom backend. You can do this without needing to\nmodify the miniaudio source code. See the [custom_backend](examples/custom_backend.c) example.\n\nBackends\n--------\n- WASAPI\n- DirectSound\n- WinMM\n- Core Audio (Apple)\n- ALSA\n- PulseAudio\n- JACK\n- sndio (OpenBSD)\n- audio(4) (NetBSD and OpenBSD)\n- OSS (FreeBSD)\n- AAudio (Android 8.0+)\n- OpenSL|ES (Android only)\n- Web Audio (Emscripten)\n- Null (Silence)\n- Custom\n\n\nSecurity\n========\nI deal with all security related issues publicly and transparently, and it can sometimes take a while before I\nget a chance to address it. If this is an issue for you, you need to use another library. The fastest way to get\na bug fixed is to submit a pull request, but if this is impractical for you please post a ticket to the public\nGitHub issue tracker.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\nYour choice of either public domain or [MIT No Attribution](https://github.com/aws/mit-0).\n",

This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest\nenvironment consistent with the production live trading environment.\n\nNautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the\nhighest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting\nand live deployment workloads.\n\nThe platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular\nadapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types\nincluding FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.\n\n![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png \"nautilus-trader\")\n\n## Features\n\n- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).\n- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.\n- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.\n- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.\n- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.\n- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).\n- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.\n- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.\n- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.\n- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).\n\n![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png \"nautilus\")\n\n> *nautilus - from ancient Greek 'sailor' and naus 'ship'.*\n>\n> *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.\n> The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*\n\n## Why NautilusTrader?\n\n- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.\n- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.\n- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.\n- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.\n\nTraditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python\nusing vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way\nusing C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot\nexpress the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have\nproven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.\n\nOne of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform\nhave all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).\nThis means we're using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,\nwith CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.\n\n## Why Python?\n\nPython was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.\nIt has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.\nBased on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.\nNot only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\n\n## Why Rust?\n\n[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe\nconcurrency. Rust is \"blazingly fast\" and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.\nIt can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.\n\nRust's rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code,\neliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on\ncorrectly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.\n\nThe project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.\n\nThis project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):\n\n> “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.\n> The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.\n> As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.\n\n## Integrations\n\nNautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues\nand data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.\n\nThe following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:\n\n| Name                                                                         | ID                    | Type                    | Status                                                  | Docs                                        |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |\n| [AX Exchange](https://architect.exchange)                                    | `AX`                  | Perpetuals Exchange     | ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/building-orange) | [Guide](docs/integrations/architect_ax.md)  |\n| [Architect](https://architect.co)                                            | `ARCHITECT`           | Brokerage (multi-venue) | ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/planned-gray)    | -

Some features may be incomplete, and while\n> the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.\n> We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.\n\nWe aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.\n\n### Branches\n\nWe aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.\n\n- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.\n- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.\n- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).\n> Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.\n> This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.\n\n## Precision mode\n\nNautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),\nwhich differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.\n\n- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.\n- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.\n> On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) Python wheels are available because MSVC's C/C++ frontend\n> does not support `__int128`, preventing the Cython/FFI layer from handling 128-bit integers.\n>\n> For pure Rust crates, high-precision works on all platforms (including Windows) since Rust handles\n> `i128`/`u128` via software emulation. The default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable\n> the `high-precision` feature flag.\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.\n\n**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nnautilus_model = { version = \"*\", features = [\"high-precision\"] }\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nWe recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n\n**There are two supported ways to install**:\n\n1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.\n2. Build from source.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a \"vanilla\" CPython.\n>\n> Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.\n\n### From PyPI\n\nTo install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python's pip package manager:\n\n```bash\npip install -U nautilus_trader\n```\n\nInstall optional dependencies as 'extras' for specific integrations (e.g., `betfair`, `docker`, `dydx`, `ib`, `polymarket`, `visualization`):\n\n```bash\npip install -U \"nautilus_trader[docker,ib]\"\n```\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras) for the full list of available extras.\n\n### From the Nautech Systems package index\n\nThe Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.\nThis enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.\n\n#### Stable wheels\n\nStable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.\n\nTo install the latest stable release:\n\n```bash\npip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:\n\n#### Development wheels\n\nDevelopment wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,\nallowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.\n\nThis process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,\nwhile adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:\n\n- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).\n- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).\n\n| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |\n| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |\n| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |\n| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |\n| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |\n| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |\n\n**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.\nSkipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.\n\n#### Installation commands\n\nBy default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.\n\nTo install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):\n\n```bash\npip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n```\n\nTo install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.221.0a20251026` for October 26, 2025):\n\n```bash\npip install nautilus_trader==1.221.0a20251026 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n```\n\n#### Available versions\n\nYou can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).\n\nTo programmatically fetch and list available versions:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP '(?<=<a href=\")[^\"]+(?=\")' | awk -F'#' '{print $1}' | sort\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> On Linux, confirm your glibc version with `ldd --version` and ensure it reports **2.35** or newer before installing binary wheels.\n\n#### Branch updates\n\n- `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): Build and publish continuously with every merged commit.\n- `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): Build and publish daily when we automatically merge the `develop` branch at **14:00 UTC** (if there are changes).\n\n#### Retention policies\n\n- `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): We retain only the most recent wheel build.\n- `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): We retain only the 30 most recent wheel builds.\n\n#### Verifying build provenance\n\nAll release artifacts (wheels and source distributions) published to PyPI, GitHub Releases,\nand the Nautech Systems package index include cryptographic attestations that prove their authenticity and build provenance.\n\nThese attestations are generated automatically during the CI/CD pipeline using [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) build provenance, and can be verified to ensure:\n\n- The artifact was built by the official NautilusTrader GitHub Actions workflow.\n- The artifact corresponds to a specific commit SHA in the repository.\n- The artifact hasn't been tampered with since it was built.\n\nTo verify a wheel file using the GitHub CLI:\n\n```bash\ngh attestation verify nautilus_trader-1.220.0-*.whl --owner nautechsystems\n```\n\nThis provides supply chain security by allowing you to cryptographically verify that the installed package came from the official NautilusTrader build process.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Attestation verification requires the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) to be installed.\n> Development wheels from `develop` and `nightly` branches are also attested and can be verified the same way.\n\n### From source\n\nIt's possible to install from source using pip if you first install the build dependencies as specified in the `pyproject.toml`.\n\n1. Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (the Rust toolchain installer):\n   - Linux and macOS:\n\n       ```bash\n       curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n       ```\n\n   - Windows:\n       - Download and install [`rustup-init.exe`](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64)\n       - Install \"Desktop development with C++\" using [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)\n   - Verify (any system):\n       from a terminal session run: `rustc --version`\n\n2. Enable `cargo` in the current shell:\n   - Linux and macOS:\n\n       ```bash\n       source $HOME/.cargo/env\n       ```\n\n   - Windows:\n     - Start a new PowerShell\n\n3. Install [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) (a C language frontend for LLVM):\n   - Linux:\n\n       ```bash\n       sudo apt-get install clang\n       ```\n\n   - Windows:\n       1. Add Clang to your [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/):\n          - Start | Visual Studio Installer | Modify | C++ Clang tools for Windows (latest) = checked | Modify\n       2. Enable `clang` in the current shell:\n\n          ```powershell\n          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('path', \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\BuildTools\\VC\\Tools\\Llvm\\x64\\bin\\;\" + $env:Path,\"User\")\n          ```\n\n   - Verify (any system):\n       from a terminal session run: `clang --version`\n\n4. Install uv (see the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) for more details):\n\n    - Linux and macOS:\n\n        ```bash\n        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n        ```\n\n    - Windows (PowerShell):\n\n        ```powershell\n        irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\n        ```\n\n5. Clone the source with `git`, and install from the project's root directory:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone --branch develop --depth 1 https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader\n    cd nautilus_trader\n    uv sync --all-extras\n    ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> The `--depth 1` flag fetches just the latest commit for a faster, lightweight clone.\n\n6. Set environment variables for PyO3 compilation (Linux and macOS only):\n\n    ```bash\n    # Linux only: Set the library path for the Python interpreter\n    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$(python -c 'import sys; print(sys.base_prefix)')/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\n\n    # Set the Python executable path for PyO3\n    export PYO3_PYTHON=$(pwd)/.venv/bin/python\n\n    # Required for Rust tests when using uv-installed Python\n    export PYTHONHOME=$(python -c \"import sys; print(sys.base_prefix)\")\n    ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` export is Linux-specific and not needed on macOS.\n>\n> The `PYTHONHOME` variable is required when running `make cargo-test` with a `uv`-installed Python.\n> Without it, tests that depend on PyO3 may fail to locate the Python runtime.\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for other options and further details.\n\n## Redis\n\nUsing [Redis](https://redis.io) with NautilusTrader is **optional** and only required if configured as the backend for a\n[cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) database or [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).\nSee the **Redis** section of the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#redis) for further details.\n\n## Makefile\n\nA `Makefile` is provided to automate most installation and build tasks for development. Some of the targets include:\n\n- `make install`: Installs in `release` build mode with all dependency groups and extras.\n- `make install-debug`: Same as `make install` but with `debug` build mode.\n- `make install-just-deps`: Installs just the `main`, `dev` and `test` dependencies (does not install package).\n- `make build`: Runs the build script in `release` build mode (default).\n- `make build-debug`: Runs the build script in `debug` build mode.\n- `make build-wheel`: Runs uv build with a wheel format in `release` mode.\n- `make build-wheel-debug`: Runs uv build with a wheel format in `debug` mode.\n- `make cargo-test`: Runs all Rust crate tests using `cargo-nextest`.\n- `make clean`: Deletes all build results, such as `.so` or `.dll` files.\n- `make distclean`: **CAUTION** Removes all artifacts not in the git index from the repository. This includes source files which have not been `git add`ed.\n- `make docs`: Builds the documentation HTML using Sphinx.\n- `make pre-commit`: Runs the pre-commit checks over all files.\n- `make ruff`: Runs ruff over all files using the `pyproject.toml` config (with autofix).\n- `make pytest`: Runs all tests with `pytest`.\n- `make test-performance`: Runs performance tests with [codspeed](https://codspeed.io).\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Run `make help` for documentation on all available make targets.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> See the [crates/infrastructure/TESTS.md](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/blob/develop/crates/infrastructure/TESTS.md) file for running the infrastructure integration tests.\n\n## Examples\n\nIndicators and strategies can be developed in both Python and Cython. For performance and\nlatency-sensitive applications, we recommend using Cython. Below are some examples:\n\n- [indicator](/nautilus_trader/examples/indicators/ema_python.py) example written in Python.\n- [indicator](/nautilus_trader/indicators/) implementations written in Cython.\n- [strategy](/nautilus_trader/examples/strategies/) examples written in Python.\n- [backtest](/examples/backtest/) examples using a `BacktestEngine` directly.\n\n## Docker\n\nDocker containers are built using the base image `python:3.12-slim` with the following variant tags:\n\n- `nautilus_trader:latest` has the latest release version installed.\n- `nautilus_trader:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed.\n- `jupyterlab:latest` has the latest release version installed along with `jupyterlab` and an\n  example backtest notebook with accompanying data.\n- `jupyterlab:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed along with `jupyterlab` and an\n  example backtest notebook with accompanying data.\n\nYou can pull the container images as follows:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/<image_variant_tag> --platform linux/amd64\n```\n\nYou can launch the backtest example container by running:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:nightly --platform linux/amd64\ndocker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:nightly\n```\n\nThen open your browser at the following address:\n\n```bash\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8888/lab\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> NautilusTrader currently exceeds the rate limit for Jupyter notebook logging (stdout output).\n> Therefore, we set the `log_level` to `ERROR` in the examples. Lowering this level to see more\n> logging will cause the notebook to hang during cell execution. We are investigating a fix that\n> may involve either raising the configured rate limits for Jupyter or throttling the log flushing\n> from Nautilus.\n>\n> - <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/12845>\n> - <https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-limit-output>\n\n## Development\n\nWe aim to provide the most pleasant developer experience possible for this hybrid codebase of Python, Cython and Rust.\nSee the [Developer Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/developer_guide/) for helpful information.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Run `make build-debug` to compile after changes to Rust or Cython code for the most efficient development workflow.\n\n### Testing with Rust\n\n[cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st) is the standard Rust test runner for NautilusTrader.\nIts key benefit is isolating each test in its own process, ensuring test reliability\nby avoiding interference.\n\nYou can install cargo-nextest by running:\n\n```bash\ncargo install cargo-nextest\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Run Rust tests with `make cargo-test`, which uses **cargo-nextest** with an efficient profile.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for considering contributing to NautilusTrader!

Check out our [jobs](https://zed.dev/jobs) page for open roles.\n\n### Licensing\n\nLicense information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.\n\nWe use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:\n\n- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you've created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate's Cargo.toml.\n- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license's requirements. If you're unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you've verified that this system is acceptable add the license's SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.\n- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).\n",

Neko is a powerful tool that allows you to **run a fully-functional browser in a virtual environment**, giving you the ability to **access the internet securely and privately from anywhere**. With Neko, you can browse the web, **run applications**, and perform other tasks just as you would on a regular browser, all within a **secure and isolated environment**. Whether you are a developer looking to test web applications, a **privacy-conscious user seeking a secure browsing experience**, or simply someone who wants to take advantage of the **convenience and flexibility of a virtual browser**, Neko is the perfect solution.\n\nIn addition to its security and privacy features, Neko offers the **ability for multiple users to access it simultaneously**. This makes it an ideal solution for teams or organizations that need to share access to a browser, as well as for individuals who want to use **multiple devices to access the same virtual environment**. With Neko, you can **easily and securely share access to a browser with others**, without having to worry about maintaining separate configurations or settings. Whether you need to **collaborate on a project**, access shared resources, or simply want to **share access to a browser with friends or family**, Neko makes it easy to do so.\n\nNeko is also a great tool for **hosting watch parties** and interactive presentations. With its virtual browser capabilities, Neko allows you to host watch parties and presentations that are **accessible from anywhere**, without the need for in-person gatherings. This makes it easy to **stay connected with friends and colleagues**, even when you are unable to meet in person. With Neko, you can easily host a watch party or give an **interactive presentation**, whether it's for leisure or work. Simply invite your guests to join the virtual environment, and you can share the screen and **interact with them in real-time**.\n\n## About\n\nThis app uses WebRTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, original author made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and he was able to figure out the rest.\n\nThen I found [this](https://github.com/nurdism/neko) project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with multiple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore and it got eventually archived.\n\n## Use-cases and comparison\n\nNeko started as a virtual browser that is streamed using WebRTC to multiple users.\n- It is **not only limited to a browser**; it can run anything that runs on linux (e.g. VLC). Browser only happens to be the most popular and widely used use-case.\n- In fact, it is not limited to a single program either; you can install a full desktop environment (e.g. XFCE, KDE).\n- Speaking of limits, it does not need to run in a container; you could install neko on your host, connect to your X server and control your whole VM.\n- Theoretically it is not limited to only X server, anything that can be controlled and scraped periodically for images could be used instead.\n  - Like implementing RDP or VNC protocol, where neko would only act as WebRTC relay server. This is currently only future.\n\nPrimary use case is connecting with multiple people, leveraging real time synchronization and interactivity:\n- **Watch party** - watching video content together with multiple people and reacting to it (chat, emotes) - open source alternative to [giggl.app](https://giggl.app/) or [hyperbeam](https://watch.hyperbeam.com).\n- **Interactive presentation** - not only screen sharing, but others can control the screen.\n- **Collaborative tool** - brainstorming ideas, cobrowsing, code debugging together.\n- **Support/Teaching** - interactively guiding people in controlled environment.\n- **Embed anything** - embed virtual browser in your web app - open source alternative to [hyperbeam API](https://hyperbeam.com/).\n  - open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants.\n  - request rooms using API with [neko-rooms](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-rooms).\n\nOther use cases that benefit from single-user:\n- **Personal workspace** - streaming containerized apps and desktops to end-users - similar to [kasm](https://www.kasmweb.com/).\n- **Persistent browser** - own browser with persistent cookies available anywhere - similar to [mightyapp](https://www.mightyapp.com/).\n  - no state is left on the host browser after terminating the connection.\n  - sensitive data like cookies are not transferred - only video is shared.\n- **Throwaway browser** - a better solution for planning secret parties and buying birthday gifts off the internet.\n  - use Tor Browser and [VPN](https://github.com/m1k1o/neko-vpn) for additional anonymity.\n  - mitigates risk of OS fingerprinting and browser vulnerabilities by running in container.\n- **Session broadcasting** -

Here are several ways to install it on your machine:\n\n- Install `llama.cpp` using [brew, nix or winget](docs/install.md)\n- Run with Docker - see our [Docker documentation](docs/docker.md)\n- Download pre-built binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases)\n- Build from source by cloning this repository - check out [our build guide](docs/build.md)\n\nOnce installed, you'll need a model to work with. Head to the [Obtaining and quantizing models](#obtaining-and-quantizing-models) section to learn more.\n\nExample command:\n\n```sh\n# Use a local model file\nllama-cli -m my_model.gguf\n\n# Or download and run a model directly from Hugging Face\nllama-cli -hf ggml-org/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF\n\n# Launch OpenAI-compatible API server\nllama-server -hf ggml-org/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF\n```\n\n## Description\n\nThe main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide\nrange of hardware - locally and in the cloud.\n\n- Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies\n- Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks\n- AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures\n- RVV, ZVFH, ZFH, ZICBOP and ZIHINTPAUSE support for RISC-V architectures\n- 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference and reduced memory use\n- Custom CUDA kernels for running LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD GPUs via HIP and Moore Threads GPUs via MUSA)\n- Vulkan and SYCL backend support\n- CPU+GPU hybrid inference to partially accelerate models larger than the total VRAM capacity\n\nThe `llama.cpp` project is the main playground for developing new features for the [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) library.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Models</summary>\n\nTypically finetunes of the base models below are supported as well.\n\nInstructions for adding support for new models:

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) platform hosts a [number of LLMs](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending) compatible with `llama.cpp`:\n\n- [Trending](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending)\n- [LLaMA](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=llama+gguf)\n\nYou can either manually download the GGUF file or directly use any `llama.cpp`-compatible models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) or other model hosting sites, such as [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/), by using this CLI argument: `-hf <user>/<model>[:quant]`. For example:\n\n```sh\nllama-cli -hf ggml-org/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF\n```\n\nBy default, the CLI would download from Hugging Face, you can switch to other options with the environment variable `MODEL_ENDPOINT`. For example, you may opt to downloading model checkpoints from ModelScope or other model sharing communities by setting the environment variable, e.g. `MODEL_ENDPOINT=https://www.modelscope.cn/`.\n\nAfter downloading a model, use the CLI tools to run it locally - see below.\n\n`llama.cpp` requires the model to be stored in the [GGUF](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md) file format. Models in other data formats can be converted to GGUF using the `convert_*.py` Python scripts in this repo.\n\nThe Hugging Face platform provides a variety of online tools for converting, quantizing and hosting models with `llama.cpp`:\n\n- Use the [GGUF-my-repo space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo) to convert to GGUF format and quantize model weights to smaller sizes\n- Use the [GGUF-my-LoRA space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-lora) to convert LoRA adapters to GGUF format (more info: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/10123)\n- Use the [GGUF-editor space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CISCai/gguf-editor) to edit GGUF meta data in the browser (more info: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/9268)\n- Use the [Inference Endpoints](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/) to directly host `llama.cpp` in the cloud (more info: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/9669)\n\nTo learn more about model quantization, [read this documentation](tools/quantize/README.md)\n\n## [`llama-cli`](tools/cli)\n\n#### A CLI tool for accessing and experimenting with most of `llama.cpp`'s functionality.\n\n- <details open>\n    <summary>Run in conversation mode</summary>\n\n    Models with a built-in chat template will automatically activate conversation mode.

This is especially important when choosing an appropriate model size and appreciating both the significant and subtle differences between LLaMA models and ChatGPT:\n- LLaMA:\n    - [Introducing LLaMA: A foundational, 65-billion-parameter large language model](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)\n    - [LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971)\n- GPT-3\n    - [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)\n- GPT-3.5 / InstructGPT / ChatGPT:\n    - [Aligning language models to follow instructions](https://openai.com/research/instruction-following)\n    - [Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155)\n\n## XCFramework\nThe XCFramework is a precompiled version of the library for iOS, visionOS, tvOS,\nand macOS. It can be used in Swift projects without the need to compile the\nlibrary from source. For example:\n```swift\n// swift-tools-version: 5.10\n// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.\n\nimport PackageDescription\n\nlet package = Package(\n    name: \"MyLlamaPackage\",\n    targets: [\n        .executableTarget(\n            name: \"MyLlamaPackage\",\n            dependencies: [\n                \"LlamaFramework\"\n            ]),\n        .binaryTarget(\n            name: \"LlamaFramework\",\n            url: \"https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/download/b5046/llama-b5046-xcframework.zip\",\n            checksum: \"c19be78b5f00d8d29a25da41042cb7afa094cbf6280a225abe614b03b20029ab\"\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\nThe above example is using an intermediate build `b5046` of the library. This can be modified\nto use a different version by changing the URL and checksum.\n\n## Completions\nCommand-line completion is available for some environments.\n\n#### Bash Completion\n```bash\n$ build/bin/llama-cli --completion-bash > ~/.llama-completion.bash\n$ source ~/.llama-completion.bash\n```\nOptionally this can be added to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to load it\nautomatically. For example:\n```console\n$ echo \"source ~/.llama-completion.bash\" >> ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [yhirose/cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) - Single-header HTTP server, used by `llama-server` - MIT license\n- [stb-image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) - Single-header image format decoder, used by multimodal subsystem - Public domain\n- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) - Single-header JSON library, used by various tools/examples - MIT License\n- [minja](https://github.com/google/minja) - Minimal Jinja parser in C++, used by various tools/examples - MIT License\n- [linenoise.cpp](./tools/run/linenoise.cpp/linenoise.cpp) - C++ library that provides readline-like line editing capabilities, used by `llama-run` - BSD 2-Clause License\n- [curl](https://curl.se/) - Client-side URL transfer library, used by various tools/examples - [CURL License](https://curl.se/docs/copyright.html)\n- [miniaudio.h](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) - Single-header audio format decoder, used by multimodal subsystem - Public domain\n- [subprocess.h](https://github.com/sheredom/subprocess.h) - Single-header process launching solution for C and C++ - Public domain\n",

We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).\n\nYou can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).\n\n## Docs\n\n- [**Codex Documentation**](https://developers.openai.com/codex)\n- [**Contributing**](./docs/contributing.md)\n- [**Installing & building**](./docs/install.md)\n- [**Open source fund**](./docs/open-source-fund.md)\n\nThis repository is licensed under the [Apache-2.0 License](LICENSE).\n",

Maybe a service is down. `docker-compose ps`. Yep, it's that microservice that's still buggy. No issue, I'll just restart it: `docker-compose restart`. Okay now let's try again. Oh wait the issue is still there. Hmm. `docker-compose ps`. Right so the service must have just stopped immediately after starting. I probably would have known that if I was reading the log stream, but there is a lot of clutter in there from other services. I could get the logs for just that one service with `docker compose logs --follow myservice` but that dies everytime the service dies so I'd need to run that command every time I restart the service. I could alternatively run `docker-compose up myservice` and in that terminal window if the service is down I could just `up` it again, but now I've got one service hogging a terminal window even after I no longer care about its logs. I guess when I want to reclaim the terminal realestate I can do `ctrl+P,Q`, but... wait, that's not working for some reason. Should I use ctrl+C instead? I can't remember if that closes the foreground process or kills the actual service.\n\nWhat a headache!\n\nMemorising docker commands is hard. Memorising aliases is slightly less hard. Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible. What if you had all the information you needed in one terminal window with every common command living one keypress away (and the ability to add custom commands as well). Lazydocker's goal is to make that dream a reality.\n\n- [Requirements](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#requirements)\n- [Installation](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#installation)\n- [Usage](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#usage)\n- [Keybindings](/docs/keybindings)\n- [Cool Features](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#cool-features)\n- [Contributing](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#contributing)\n- [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/NICqQPxwJWw)\n- [Config Docs](/docs/Config.md)\n- [Twitch Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/jesseduffield)\n- [FAQ](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker#faq)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Docker >= **29.0.0** (API >= **1.24**)\n- Docker-Compose >= **1.23.2** (optional)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Homebrew\n\nNormally `lazydocker` formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you to tap our formula to get frequently updated one. It works with Linux, too.\n\n**Tap**:\n```sh\nbrew install jesseduffield/lazydocker/lazydocker\n```\n\n**Core**:\n```sh\nbrew install lazydocker\n```\n\n### Scoop (Windows)\n\nYou can install `lazydocker` using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/):\n\n```sh\nscoop install lazydocker\n```\n### Chocolatey (Windows)\n\nYou can install `lazydocker` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):\n\n```sh\nchoco install lazydocker\n```\n### asdf-vm\n\nYou can install [asdf-lazydocker plugin](https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker) using [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/):\n#### Setup (Once)\n```sh\nasdf plugin add lazydocker https://github.com/comdotlinux/asdf-lazydocker.git\n```\n\n#### For Install / Upgrade\n```sh\nasdf list all lazydocker\nasdf install lazydocker latest\nasdf global lazydocker latest\n```\n\n### Binary Release (Linux/OSX/Windows)\n\nYou can manually download a binary release from [the release page](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/releases).\n\nAutomated install/update, don't forget to always verify what you're piping into bash:\n\n```sh\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/master/scripts/install_update_linux.sh | bash\n```\nThe script installs downloaded binary to `$HOME/.local/bin` directory by default, but it can be changed by setting `DIR` environment variable.\n\n### Go\n\nRequired Go Version >= **1.19**\n\n```sh\ngo install github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker@latest\n```\n\nRequired Go version >= **1.8**, <= **1.17**\n\n```sh\ngo get github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker\n```\n\n### Arch Linux AUR\n\nYou can install lazydocker using the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazydocker) by running:\n\n```sh\nyay -S lazydocker\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/lazyteam/lazydocker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazyteam/lazydocker)\n[![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/lazyteam/lazydocker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazyteam/lazydocker)\n[![Docker Automated](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/automated/lazyteam/lazydocker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lazyteam/lazydocker)\n\n1. <details><summary>Click if you have an ARM device</summary><p>\n\n    - If you have a ARM 32 bit v6 architecture\n\n        ```sh\n        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \\\n        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm32v6/golang \\\n        --build-arg GOARCH=arm \\\n        --build-arg GOARM=6 \\\n        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\n        ```\n\n    - If you have a ARM 32 bit v7 architecture\n\n        ```sh\n        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \\\n        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm32v7/golang \\\n        --build-arg GOARCH=arm \\\n        --build-arg GOARM=7 \\\n        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\n        ```\n\n    - If you have a ARM 64 bit v8 architecture\n\n        ```sh\n        docker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \\\n        --build-arg BASE_IMAGE_BUILDER=arm64v8/golang \\\n        --build-arg GOARCH=arm64 \\\n        https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\n        ```\n\n    </p></details>\n\n1. Run the container\n\n    ```sh\n    docker run --rm -it -v \\\n    /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n    -v /yourpath:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker \\\n    lazyteam/lazydocker\n    ```\n\n    - Don't forget to change `/yourpath` to an actual path you created to store lazydocker's config\n    - You can also use this [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)\n    - You might want to create an alias, for example:\n\n        ```sh\n        echo \"alias lzd='docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /yourpath/config:/.config/jesseduffield/lazydocker lazyteam/lazydocker'\" >> ~/.zshrc\n        ```\n\n\n\nFor development, you can build the image using:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\ncd lazydocker\ndocker build -t lazyteam/lazydocker \\\n    --build-arg BUILD_DATE=`date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"` \\\n    --build-arg VCS_REF=`git rev-parse --short HEAD` \\\n    --build-arg VERSION=`git describe --abbrev=0 --tag` \\\n    .\n```\n\nIf you encounter a compatibility issue with Docker bundled binary, try rebuilding\nthe image with the build argument `--build-arg DOCKER_VERSION=\"v$(docker -v | cut -d\" \" -f3 | rev | cut -c 2- | rev)\"`\nso that the bundled docker binary matches your host docker binary version.\n\n### Manual\n\nYou'll need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker.git\ncd lazydocker\ngo install\n```\n\nYou can also use `go run main.go` to compile and run in one go (pun definitely intended)\n\n## Usage\n\nCall `lazydocker` in your terminal. I personally use this a lot so I've made an alias for it like so:\n\n```\necho \"alias lzd='lazydocker'\" >> ~/.zshrc\n```\n\n(you can substitute .zshrc for whatever rc file you're using)\n\n- Basic video tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/NICqQPxwJWw).\n- List of keybindings\n  [here](/docs/keybindings).\n\n## Cool features\n\neverything is one keypress away (or one click away! Mouse support FTW):\n\n- viewing the state of your docker or docker-compose container environment at a glance\n- viewing logs for a container/service\n- viewing ascii graphs of your containers' metrics so that you can not only feel but also look like a developer\n- customising those graphs to measure nearly any metric you want\n- attaching to a container/service\n- restarting/removing/rebuilding containers/services\n- viewing the ancestor layers of a given image\n- pruning containers, images, or volumes that are hogging up disk space\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere is still a lot of work to go! Please check out the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\nFor contributor discussion about things not better discussed here in the repo, join the discord channel\n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/ehwFt2t4wt\"><img src='/docs/resources/discord.png' width='75'></a>\n\n## Donate\n\nIf you would like to support the development of lazydocker, consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/jesseduffield) (github is matching all donations dollar-for-dollar for 12 months)\n\n## Social\n\nIf you want to see what I (Jesse) am up to in terms of development, follow me on\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/DuffieldJesse) or watch me program on\n[twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jesseduffield)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I edit my config?\n\nBy opening lazydocker, clicking on the 'project' panel in the top left, and pressing 'o' (or 'e' if your editor is vim). See [Config Docs](/docs/Config.md)\n\n### How do I get text to wrap in my main panel?\n\nIn the future I want to make this the default, but for now there are some CPU issues that arise with wrapping. If you want to enable wrapping, use `gui.wrapMainPanel: true`\n\n### How do you select text?\n\nBecause we support mouse events, you will need to hold option while dragging the mouse to indicate you're trying to select text rather than click on something. Alternatively you can disable mouse events via the `gui.ignoreMouseEvents` config value.\n\nMac Users: See [Issue #190](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker/issues/190) for other options.\n\n### Why can't I see my container's logs?\n\nBy default we only show logs from the last hour, so that we're not putting too much strain on the machine. This may be why you can't see logs when you first start lazydocker. This can be overwritten in the config's `commandTemplates`\n\nIf you are running lazydocker in Docker container, it is a know bug, that you can't see logs or CPU usage.\n\n## Alternatives\n\n- [docui](https://github.com/skanehira/docui) - Skanehira beat me to the punch on making a docker terminal UI, so definitely check out that repo as well! I think the two repos can live in harmony though: lazydocker is more about managing existing containers/services, and docui is more about creating and configuring them.\n- [Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) - Portainer tries to solve the same problem but it's accessed via your browser rather than your terminal. It also supports docker swarm.\n- See [Awesome Docker list](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker/blob/master/README.md#terminal) for similar tools to work with Docker.\n",

This will perform the setup automatically.\nThe script supports installation via `apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, `zypper`, `rpm`, and `pacman` on Linux:\n\n```\nbash <(curl -sL https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/raw/master/get-xpipe.sh)\n```\n\nOf course, there are also other installation methods available.\n\n### Debian-based distros\n\nThe following debian installers are available:\n\n- [Linux .deb Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-x86_64.deb)\n- [Linux .deb Installer (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-arm64.deb)\n\nNote that you should use apt to install the package with `sudo apt install <file>` as other package managers, for example dpkg,\nare not able to resolve and install any dependency packages.\n\n### RHEL-based distros\n\nThe rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc.\nYou can import it via `rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc` to allow your rpm-based package manager to verify the release signature. \n\nThe following rpm installers are available:\n\n- [Linux .rpm Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-x86_64.rpm)\n- [Linux .rpm Installer (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-arm64.rpm)\n\n### Arch\n\nThere is an official [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xpipe) available that you can either install manually or via an AUR helper such as with `yay -S xpipe`.\n\n### AppImages\n\nAlternatively, there are also AppImages available. These can be useful if you are using an immutable distro.\n\n- [Linux .AppImage Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-x86_64.AppImage)\n- [Linux .AppImage Portable (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-arm64.AppImage)\n\n### NixOS\n\nThere's an official [xpipe nixpkg](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=xpipe&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=xpipe) available that you can install with `nix-env -iA nixos.xpipe` on x86_64 Linux systems. This package is however usually not up to date.\n\nThere is also a custom repository that contains the latest up-to-date release flakes for Linux and macOS systems: https://github.com/xpipe-io/nixpkg.\n\n### Tarball\n\nIn case you prefer to use an archive version that you can extract anywhere, you can use these:\n\n- [Linux .tar.gz Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-x86_64.tar.gz)\n- [Linux .tar.gz Portable (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-arm64.tar.gz)\n\n### Docker container\n\nXPipe is a desktop application first and foremost. It requires a full desktop environment to function with various installed applications such as terminals, editors, shells, CLI tools, and more. So there is no true web-based interface for XPipe.\n\nSince it might make sense however to access your XPipe environment from the web, there is also a so-called webtop docker container image for XPipe. [XPipe Webtop](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe-webtop) is a web-based desktop environment that can be run in a container and accessed from a browser via KasmVNC. The desktop environment comes with XPipe and various terminals and editors preinstalled and configured. This image is also available for Kasm Workspaces in the [XPipe Kasm Registry](https://github.com/xpipe-io/kasm-registry).\n\n# Further information\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n<img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=xpipe-io/xpipe\" alt=\"contrib.rocks image\" />\n\n## Open source model\n\nXPipe follows an open core model, which essentially means that the main application is open source while certain other components are not. This mainly concerns the features only available in the homelab/professional plan and the shell handling library implementation. Furthermore, some CI pipelines and tests that run on private servers are also not included in the open repository.\n\nThe distributed XPipe application consists out of two parts:\n- The open-source core that you can find this repository. It is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](/LICENSE.md).\n- The closed-source extensions, mostly for homelab/professional plan features, which are not included in this repository\n\nAdditional features are available in the homelab/professional plan. For more details see https://xpipe.io/pricing.\nIf your enterprise puts great emphasis on having access to the full source code, there are also full source-available enterprise options available.\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the documentation at https://docs.xpipe.io.\n\n## Discord\n\n[![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/979695018782646285/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/8y89vS8cRb)\n",

If you have an older version of fzf, or want finer control, you can\n> source individual script files in the [/shell](/shell) directory. The\n> location of the files may vary depending on the package manager you use.\n> Please refer to the package documentation for more information.\n> (e.g. `apt show fzf`)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can disable CTRL-T, CTRL-R, or ALT-C bindings by setting the\n> corresponding `*_COMMAND` variable to an empty string when sourcing the\n> script. For example, to disable CTRL-R and ALT-C:\n>\n> * bash: `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval \"$(fzf --bash)\"`\n> * zsh: `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source <(fzf --zsh)`\n> * fish: `fzf --fish | FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source`\n>\n> Setting the variables after sourcing the script will have no effect.\n\n### Vim/Neovim plugin\n\nIf you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this to\nyour Vim configuration file:\n\n```vim\nPlug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }\nPlug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'\n```\n\n* `junegunn/fzf` provides the basic library functions\n    * `fzf#install()` makes sure that you have the latest binary\n* `junegunn/fzf.vim` is [a separate project](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)\n  that provides a variety of useful commands\n\nTo learn more about the Vim integration, see [README-VIM.md](README-VIM.md).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out\n> [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua).\n\nUpgrading fzf\n-------------\n\nfzf is being actively developed, and you might want to upgrade it once in a\nwhile. Please follow the instruction below depending on the installation\nmethod used.\n\n- git: `cd ~/.fzf && git pull && ./install`\n- brew: `brew update; brew upgrade fzf`\n- macports: `sudo port upgrade fzf`\n- chocolatey: `choco upgrade fzf`\n- vim-plug: `:PlugUpdate fzf`\n\nBuilding fzf\n------------\n\nSee [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nfzf will launch interactive finder, read the list from STDIN, and write the\nselected item to STDOUT.\n\n```sh\nfind * -type f | fzf > selected\n```\n\nWithout STDIN pipe, fzf will traverse the file system under the current\ndirectory to get the list of files.\n\n```sh\nvim $(fzf)\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You can override the default behavior\n> * Either by setting `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` to a command that generates the desired list\n> * Or by setting `--walker`, `--walker-root`, and `--walker-skip` options in `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> A more robust solution would be to use `xargs` but we've presented\n> the above as it's easier to grasp\n> ```sh\n> fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim\n> ```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> fzf also has the ability to turn itself into a different process.\n>\n> ```sh\n> fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})'\n> ```\n>\n> *See [Turning into a different process](#turning-into-a-different-process)\n> for more information.*\n\n### Using the finder\n\n- `CTRL-K` / `CTRL-J` (or `CTRL-P` / `CTRL-N`) to move cursor up and down\n- `Enter` key to select the item, `CTRL-C` / `CTRL-G` / `ESC` to exit\n- On multi-select mode (`-m`), `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items\n- Emacs style key bindings\n- Mouse: scroll, click, double-click; shift-click and shift-scroll on\n  multi-select mode\n\n### Display modes\n\nfzf by default runs in fullscreen mode, but there are other display modes.\n\n#### `--height` mode\n\nWith `--height HEIGHT[%]`, fzf will start below the cursor with the given height.\n\n```sh\nfzf --height 40%\n```\n\n`reverse` layout and `--border` goes well with this option.\n\n```sh\nfzf --height 40% --layout reverse --border\n```\n\nBy prepending `~` to the height, you're setting the maximum height.\n\n```sh\n# Will take as few lines as possible to display the list\nseq 3 | fzf --height ~100%\nseq 3000 | fzf --height ~100%\n```\n\nHeight value can be a negative number.\n\n```sh\n# Screen height - 3\nfzf --height -3\n```\n\n#### `--tmux` mode\n\nWith `--tmux` option, fzf will start in a tmux popup.\n\n```sh\n# --tmux [center|top|bottom|left|right][,SIZE[%]][,SIZE[%][,border-native]]\n\nfzf --tmux center         # Center, 50% width and height\nfzf --tmux 80%            # Center, 80% width and height\nfzf --tmux 100%,50%       # Center, 100% width and 50% height\nfzf --tmux left,40%       # Left, 40% width\nfzf --tmux left,40%,90%   # Left, 40% width, 90% height\nfzf --tmux top,40%        # Top, 40% height\nfzf --tmux bottom,80%,40% # Bottom, 80% width, 40% height\n```\n\n`--tmux` is silently ignored when you're not on tmux.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you're stuck with an old version of tmux that doesn't support popup,\n> or if you want to open fzf in a regular tmux pane, check out\n> [fzf-tmux](bin/fzf-tmux) script.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can add these options to `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` so that they're applied by\n> default. For example,\n>\n> ```sh\n> # Open in tmux popup if on tmux, otherwise use --height mode\n> export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --tmux bottom,40% --layout reverse --border top'\n> ```\n\n### Search syntax\n\nUnless otherwise specified, fzf starts in \"extended-search mode\" where you can\ntype in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. e.g. `^music .mp3$ sbtrkt\n!fire`\n\n| Token     | Match type                              | Description                                  |\n| --------- | --------------------------------------  | ------------------------------------------   |\n| `sbtrkt`  | fuzzy-match                             | Items that match `sbtrkt`                    |\n| `'wild`   | exact-match (quoted)                    | Items that include `wild`                    |\n| `'wild'`  | exact-boundary-match (quoted both ends) | Items that include `wild` at word boundaries |\n| `^music`  | prefix-exact-match                      | Items that start with `music`                |\n| `.mp3$`   | suffix-exact-match                      | Items that end with `.mp3`                   |\n| `!fire`   | inverse-exact-match                     | Items that do not include `fire`             |\n| `!^music` | inverse-prefix-exact-match              | Items that do not start with `music`         |\n| `!.mp3$`  | inverse-suffix-exact-match              | Items that do not end with `.mp3`            |\n\nIf you don't prefer fuzzy matching and do not wish to \"quote\" every word,\nstart fzf with `-e` or `--exact` option. Note that when  `--exact` is set,\n`'`-prefix \"unquotes\" the term.\n\nA single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following\nquery matches entries that start with `core` and end with either `go`, `rb`,\nor `py`.\n\n```\n^core go$ | rb$ | py$\n```\n\n### Environment variables\n\n- `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND`\n    - Default command to use when input is tty\n    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f'`\n- `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`\n    - Default options\n    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=\"--layout=reverse --inline-info\"`\n- `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE`\n    - If you prefer to manage default options in a file, set this variable to\n      point to the location of the file\n    - e.g. `export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS_FILE=~/.fzfrc`\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> `FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is not used by shell integration due to the\n> slight difference in requirements.\n>\n> * `CTRL-T` runs `$FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to get a list of files and directories\n> * `ALT-C` runs `$FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to get a list of directories\n> * `vim ~/**<tab>` runs `fzf_compgen_path()` with the prefix (`~/`) as the first argument\n> * `cd foo**<tab>` runs `fzf_compgen_dir()` with the prefix (`foo`) as the first argument\n>\n> The available options are described later in this document.\n\n### Customizing the look\n\nThe user interface of fzf is fully customizable with a large number of\nconfiguration options. For a quick setup, you can start with one of the style\npresets — `default`, `full`, or `minimal` — using the `--style` option.\n\n```sh\nfzf --style full \\\n    --preview 'fzf-preview.sh {}' --bind 'focus:transform-header:file --brief {}'\n```\n\n| Preset    | Screenshot                                                                             |\n| :---      | :---                                                                                   |\n| `default` | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-default.png\"/> |\n| `full`    | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-full.png\"/>    |\n| `minimal` | <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-style-minimal.png\"/> |\n\nHere's an example based on the `full` preset:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/i/master/fzf-4-borders.png\"/>\n\n<details>\n\n```sh\ngit ls-files | fzf --style full \\\n    --border --padding 1,2 \\\n    --border-label ' Demo ' --input-label ' Input ' --header-label ' File Type ' \\\n    --preview 'fzf-preview.sh {}' \\\n    --bind 'result:transform-list-label:\n        if [[ -z $FZF_QUERY ]]; then\n          echo \" $FZF_MATCH_COUNT items \"\n        else\n          echo \" $FZF_MATCH_COUNT matches for [$FZF_QUERY] \"\n        fi\n        ' \\\n    --bind 'focus:transform-preview-label:[[ -n {} ]] && printf \" Previewing [%s] \" {}' \\\n    --bind 'focus:+transform-header:file --brief {} || echo \"No file selected\"' \\\n    --bind 'ctrl-r:change-list-label( Reloading the list )+reload(sleep 2; git ls-files)' \\\n    --color 'border:#aaaaaa,label:#cccccc' \\\n    --color 'preview-border:#9999cc,preview-label:#ccccff' \\\n    --color 'list-border:#669966,list-label:#99cc99' \\\n    --color 'input-border:#996666,input-label:#ffcccc' \\\n    --color 'header-border:#6699cc,header-label:#99ccff'\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Options\n\nSee the man page (`fzf --man` or `man fzf`) for the full list of options.\n\n### Demo\nIf you learn by watching videos, check out this screencast by [@samoshkin](https://github.com/samoshkin) to explore `fzf` features.\n\n<a title=\"fzf - command-line fuzzy finder\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgG5Jhi_Els\">\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vtG8olE.png\" width=\"640\">\n</a>\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n* [Wiki page of examples](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/examples)\n    * *Disclaimer: The examples on this page are maintained by the community\n      and are not thoroughly tested*\n* [Advanced fzf examples](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md)\n\nKey bindings for command-line\n-----------------------------\n\nBy [setting up shell integration](#setting-up-shell-integration), you can use\nthe following key bindings in bash, zsh, and fish.\n\n- `CTRL-T` - Paste the selected files and directories onto the command-line\n    - The list is generated using `--walker file,dir,follow,hidden` option\n        - You can override the behavior by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to a custom command that generates the desired list\n        - Or you can set `--walker*` options in `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS`\n    - Set `FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf\n      ```sh\n      # Preview file content using bat (https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)\n      export FZF_CTRL_T_OPTS=\"\n        --walker-skip .git,node_modules,target\n        --preview 'bat -n --color=always {}'\n        --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(down|hidden|)'\"\n      ```\n    - Can be disabled by setting `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND` to an empty string when\n      sourcing the script\n- `CTRL-R` - Paste the selected command from history onto the command-line\n    - If you want to see the commands in chronological order, press `CTRL-R`\n      again which toggles sorting by relevance\n    - Press `ALT-R` to toggle \"raw\" mode where you can see the surrounding items\n      of a match. In this mode, you can press `CTRL-N` and `CTRL-P` to move\n      between the matching items only.\n    - Press `CTRL-/` or `ALT-/` to toggle line wrapping\n    - Set `FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf\n      ```sh\n      # CTRL-Y to copy the command into clipboard using pbcopy\n      export FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS=\"\n        --bind 'ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo -n {2..} | pbcopy)+abort'\n        --color header:italic\n        --header 'Press CTRL-Y to copy command into clipboard'\"\n      ```\n    - Can be disabled by setting `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND` to an empty string when\n      sourcing the script\n    - Custom override via a non-empty `FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND` is not yet supported and will emit a warning\n- `ALT-C` - cd into the selected directory\n    - The list is generated using `--walker dir,follow,hidden` option\n    - Set `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to override the default command\n        - Or you can set `--walker-*` options in `FZF_ALT_C_OPTS`\n    - Set `FZF_ALT_C_OPTS` to pass additional options to fzf\n      ```sh\n      # Print tree structure in the preview window\n      export FZF_ALT_C_OPTS=\"\n        --walker-skip .git,node_modules,target\n        --preview 'tree -C {}'\"\n      ```\n    - Can be disabled by setting `FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND` to an empty string when\n      sourcing the script\n\nDisplay modes for these bindings can be separately configured via\n`FZF_{CTRL_T,CTRL_R,ALT_C}_OPTS` or globally via `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`.\n(e.g. `FZF_CTRL_R_OPTS='--tmux bottom,60% --height 60% --border top'`)\n\nMore tips can be found on [the wiki page](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Configuring-shell-key-bindings).\n\nFuzzy completion for bash and zsh\n---------------------------------\n\n### Files and directories\n\nFuzzy completion for files and directories can be triggered if the word before\nthe cursor ends with the trigger sequence, which is by default `**`.\n\n- `COMMAND [DIRECTORY/][FUZZY_PATTERN]**<TAB>`\n\n```sh\n# Files under the current directory\n# - You can select multiple items with TAB key\nvim **<TAB>\n\n# Files under parent directory\nvim ../**<TAB>\n\n# Files under parent directory that match `fzf`\nvim ../fzf**<TAB>\n\n# Files under your home directory\nvim ~/**<TAB>\n\n\n# Directories under current directory (single-selection)\ncd **<TAB>\n\n# Directories under ~/github that match `fzf`\ncd ~/github/fzf**<TAB>\n```\n\n### Process IDs\n\nFuzzy completion for PIDs is provided for kill command.\n\n```sh\n# Can select multiple processes with <TAB> or <Shift-TAB> keys\nkill -9 **<TAB>\n```\n\n### Host names\n\nFor ssh and telnet commands, fuzzy completion for hostnames is provided. The\nnames are extracted from /etc/hosts and ~/.ssh/config.\n\n```sh\nssh **<TAB>\ntelnet **<TAB>\n```\n\n### Environment variables / Aliases\n\n```sh\nunset **<TAB>\nexport **<TAB>\nunalias **<TAB>\n```\n\n### Customizing fzf options for completion\n\n```sh\n# Use ~~ as the trigger sequence instead of the default **\nexport FZF_COMPLETION_TRIGGER='~~'\n\n# Options to fzf command\nexport FZF_COMPLETION_OPTS='--border --info=inline'\n\n# Options for path completion (e.g. vim **<TAB>)\nexport FZF_COMPLETION_PATH_OPTS='--walker file,dir,follow,hidden'\n\n# Options for directory completion (e.g. cd **<TAB>)\nexport FZF_COMPLETION_DIR_OPTS='--walker dir,follow'\n\n# Advanced customization of fzf options via _fzf_comprun function\n# - The first argument to the function is the name of the command.\n# - You should make sure to pass the rest of the arguments ($@) to fzf.\n_fzf_comprun() {\n  local command=$1\n  shift\n\n  case \"$command\" in\n    cd)           fzf --preview 'tree -C {} | head -200'   \"$@\" ;;\n    export|unset) fzf --preview \"eval 'echo \\$'{}\"         \"$@\" ;;\n    ssh)          fzf --preview 'dig {}'                   \"$@\" ;;\n    *)            fzf --preview 'bat -n --color=always {}' \"$@\" ;;\n  esac\n}\n```\n\n### Customizing completion source for paths and directories\n\n```sh\n# Use fd (https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for listing path candidates.\n# - The first argument to the function ($1) is the base path to start traversal\n# - See the source code (completion.{bash,zsh}) for the details.\n_fzf_compgen_path() {\n  fd --hidden --follow --exclude \".git\" . \"$1\"\n}\n\n# Use fd to generate the list for directory completion\n_fzf_compgen_dir() {\n  fd --type d --hidden --follow --exclude \".git\" . \"$1\"\n}\n```\n\n### Supported commands\n\nOn bash, fuzzy completion is enabled only for a predefined set of commands\n(`complete | grep _fzf` to see the list). But you can enable it for other\ncommands as well by using `_fzf_setup_completion` helper function.\n\n```sh\n# usage: _fzf_setup_completion path|dir|var|alias|host COMMANDS...\n_fzf_setup_completion path ag git kubectl\n_fzf_setup_completion dir tree\n```\n\n### Custom fuzzy completion\n\n_**(Custom completion API is experimental and subject to change)**_\n\nFor a command named _\"COMMAND\"_, define `_fzf_complete_COMMAND` function using\n`_fzf_complete` helper.\n\n```sh\n# Custom fuzzy completion for \"doge\" command\n#   e.g. doge **<TAB>\n_fzf_complete_doge() {\n  _fzf_complete --multi --reverse --prompt=\"doge> \" -- \"$@\" < <(\n    echo very\n    echo wow\n    echo such\n    echo doge\n  )\n}\n```\n\n- The arguments before `--` are the options to fzf.\n- After `--`, simply pass the original completion arguments unchanged (`\"$@\"`).\n- Then, write a set of commands that generates the completion candidates and\n  feed its output to the function using process substitution (`< <(...)`).\n\nzsh will automatically pick up the function using the naming convention but in\nbash you have to manually associate the function with the command using the\n`complete` command.\n\n```sh\n[ -n \"$BASH\" ] && complete -F _fzf_complete_doge -o default -o bashdefault doge\n```\n\nIf you need to post-process the output from fzf, define\n`_fzf_complete_COMMAND_post` as follows.\n\n```sh\n_fzf_complete_foo() {\n  _fzf_complete --multi --reverse --header-lines=3 -- \"$@\" < <(\n    ls -al\n  )\n}\n\n_fzf_complete_foo_post() {\n  awk '{print $NF}'\n}\n\n[ -n \"$BASH\" ] && complete -F _fzf_complete_foo -o default -o bashdefault foo\n```\n\nVim plugin\n----------\n\nSee [README-VIM.md](README-VIM.md).\n\nAdvanced topics\n---------------\n\n### Customizing for different types of input\n\nSince fzf is a general-purpose text filter, its algorithm was designed to\n\"generally\" work well with any kind of input. However, admittedly, there is no\ntrue one-size-fits-all solution, and you may want to tweak the algorithm and\nsome of the settings depending on the type of the input. To make this process\neasier, fzf provides a set of \"scheme\"s for some common input types.\n\n| Scheme             | Description                                                                         |\n| :---               | :---                                                                                |\n| `--scheme=default` | Generic scheme designed to work well with any kind of input                         |\n| `--scheme=path`    | Suitable for file paths                                                             |\n| `--scheme=history` | Suitable for command history or any input where chronological ordering is important |\n\n(See `fzf --man` for the details)\n\n### Performance\n\nfzf is fast. Performance should not be a problem in most use cases. However,\nyou might want to be aware of the options that can affect performance.\n\n- `--ansi` tells fzf to extract and parse ANSI color codes in the input, and it\n  makes the initial scanning slower. So it's not recommended that you add it\n  to your `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`.\n- `--nth` makes fzf slower because it has to tokenize each line.\n- A plain string `--delimiter` should be preferred over a regular expression\n  delimiter.\n- `--with-nth` makes fzf slower as fzf has to tokenize and reassemble each\n  line.\n\n### Executing external programs\n\nYou can set up key bindings for starting external processes without leaving\nfzf (`execute`, `execute-silent`).\n\n```bash\n# Press F1 to open the file with less without leaving fzf\n# Press CTRL-Y to copy the line to clipboard and aborts fzf (requires pbcopy)\nfzf --bind 'f1:execute(less -f {}),ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo {} | pbcopy)+abort'\n```\n\nSee *KEY/EVENT BINDINGS* section of the man page for details.\n\n### Turning into a different process\n\n`become(...)` is similar to `execute(...)`/`execute-silent(...)` described\nabove, but instead of executing the command and coming back to fzf on\ncomplete, it turns fzf into a new process for the command.\n\n```sh\nfzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {})'\n```\n\nCompared to the seemingly equivalent command substitution `vim \"$(fzf)\"`, this\napproach has several advantages:\n\n* Vim will not open an empty file when you terminate fzf with\n  <kbd>CTRL-C</kbd>\n* Vim will not open an empty file when you press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> on an empty\n  result\n* Can handle multiple selections even when they have whitespaces\n  ```sh\n  fzf --multi --bind 'enter:become(vim {+})'\n  ```\n\nTo be fair, running `fzf --print0 | xargs -0 -o vim` instead of `vim \"$(fzf)\"`\nresolves all of the issues mentioned. Nonetheless, `become(...)` still offers\nadditional benefits in different scenarios.\n\n* You can set up multiple bindings to handle the result in different ways\n  without any wrapping script\n  ```sh\n  fzf --bind 'enter:become(vim {}),ctrl-e:become(emacs {})'\n  ```\n  * Previously, you would have to use `--expect=ctrl-e` and check the first\n    line of the output of fzf\n* You can easily build the subsequent command using the field index\n  expressions of fzf\n  ```sh\n  # Open the file in Vim and go to the line\n  git grep --line-number . |\n      fzf --delimiter : --nth 3.. --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})'\n  ```\n\n### Reloading the candidate list\n\nBy binding `reload` action to a key or an event, you can make fzf dynamically\nreload the candidate list. See https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750 for\nmore details.\n\n#### 1. Update the list of processes by pressing CTRL-R\n\n```sh\nps -ef |\n  fzf --bind 'ctrl-r:reload(ps -ef)' \\\n      --header 'Press CTRL-R to reload' --header-lines=1 \\\n      --height=50% --layout=reverse\n```\n\n#### 2. Switch between sources by pressing CTRL-D or CTRL-F\n\n```sh\nFZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='find . -type f' \\\n  fzf --bind 'ctrl-d:reload(find . -type d),ctrl-f:reload(eval \"$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND\")' \\\n      --height=50% --layout=reverse\n```\n\n#### 3. Interactive ripgrep integration\n\nThe following example uses fzf as the selector interface for ripgrep. We bound\n`reload` action to `change` event, so every time you type on fzf, the ripgrep\nprocess will restart with the updated query string denoted by the placeholder\nexpression `{q}`. Also, note that we used `--disabled` option so that fzf\ndoesn't perform any secondary filtering.\n\n```sh\n: | rg_prefix='rg --column --line-number --no-heading --color=always --smart-case' \\\n    fzf --bind 'start:reload:$rg_prefix \"\"' \\\n        --bind 'change:reload:$rg_prefix {q} || true' \\\n        --bind 'enter:become(vim {1} +{2})' \\\n        --ansi --disabled \\\n        --height=50% --layout=reverse\n```\n\nIf ripgrep doesn't find any matches, it will exit with a non-zero exit status,\nand fzf will warn you about it. To suppress the warning message, we added\n`|| true` to the command, so that it always exits with 0.\n\nSee [\"Using fzf as interactive Ripgrep launcher\"](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#using-fzf-as-interactive-ripgrep-launcher)\nfor more sophisticated examples.\n\n### Preview window\n\nWhen the `--preview` option is set, fzf automatically starts an external process\nwith the current line as the argument and shows the result in the split window.\nYour `$SHELL` is used to execute the command with `$SHELL -c COMMAND`.\nThe window can be scrolled using the mouse or custom key bindings.\n\n```bash\n# {} is replaced with the single-quoted string of the focused line\nfzf --preview 'cat {}'\n```\n\nPreview window supports ANSI colors, so you can use any program that\nsyntax-highlights the content of a file, such as\n[Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) or\n[Highlight](https://gitlab.com/saalen/highlight):\n\n```bash\nfzf --preview 'bat --color=always {}' --preview-window '~3'\n```\n\nYou can customize the size, position, and border of the preview window using\n`--preview-window` option, and the foreground and background color of it with\n`--color` option. For example,\n\n```bash\nfzf --height 40% --layout reverse --info inline --border \\\n    --preview 'file {}' --preview-window up,1,border-horizontal \\\n    --bind 'ctrl-/:change-preview-window(50%|hidden|)' \\\n    --color 'fg:#bbccdd,fg+:#ddeeff,bg:#334455,preview-bg:#223344,border:#778899'\n```\n\nSee the man page (`man fzf`) for the full list of options.\n\nMore advanced examples can be found [here](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/ADVANCED.md).\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Since fzf is a general-purpose text filter rather than a file finder, **it is\n> not a good idea to add `--preview` option to your `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`**.\n>\n> ```sh\n> # *********************\n> # ** DO NOT DO THIS! **\n> # *********************\n> export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--preview \"bat --style=numbers --color=always --line-range :500 {}\"'\n>\n> # bat doesn't work with any input other than the list of files\n> ps -ef | fzf\n> seq 100 | fzf\n> history | fzf\n> ```\n\n### Previewing an image\n\nfzf can display images in the preview window using one of the following protocols:\n\n* [Kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/)\n* [iTerm2 inline images protocol](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html)\n* [Sixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel)\n\nSee [bin/fzf-preview.sh](bin/fzf-preview.sh) script for more information.\n\n```sh\nfzf --preview 'fzf-preview.sh {}'\n```\n\nTips\n----\n\n### Respecting `.gitignore`\n\nYou can use [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd),\n[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), or [the silver\nsearcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) to traverse the file\nsystem while respecting `.gitignore`.\n\n```sh\n# Feed the output of fd into fzf\nfd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix | fzf\n\n# Setting fd as the default source for fzf\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix'\n\n# Now fzf (w/o pipe) will use the fd command to generate the list\nfzf\n\n# To apply the command to CTRL-T as well\nexport FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND=\"$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND\"\n```\n\nIf you want the command to follow symbolic links and don't want it to exclude\nhidden files, use the following command:\n\n```sh\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type f --strip-cwd-prefix --hidden --follow --exclude .git'\n```\n\n### Fish shell\n\n`CTRL-T` key binding of fish, unlike those of bash and zsh, will use the last\ntoken on the command-line as the root directory for the recursive search. For\ninstance, hitting `CTRL-T` at the end of the following command-line\n\n```sh\nls /var/\n```\n\nwill list all files and directories under `/var/`.\n\nWhen using a custom `FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND`, use the unexpanded `$dir` variable to\nmake use of this feature. `$dir` defaults to `.` when the last token is not a\nvalid directory. Example:\n\n```sh\nset -g FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND \"command find -L \\$dir -type f 2> /dev/null | sed '1d; s#^\\./##'\"\n```\n\n### fzf Theme Playground\n\n[fzf Theme Playground](https://vitormv.github.io/fzf-themes/) created by\n[Vitor Mello](https://github.com/vitormv) is a webpage where you can\ninteractively create fzf themes.\n\nRelated projects\n----------------\n\nhttps://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Related-projects\n\n[License](LICENSE)\n------------------\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2025 Junegunn Choi\n\nGoods\n-----\n\nGrab fzf T-shirts, mugs, and stickers here: https://commitgoods.com/collections/fzf\n\nSponsors :heart:\n----------------\n\nI would like to thank all the sponsors of this project who make it possible for me to continue to improve fzf.\n\nIf you'd like to sponsor this project, please visit https://github.com/sponsors/junegunn.\n\n<!-- sponsors --><a href=\"https://github.com/miyanokomiya\"><img src=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;miyanokomiya.png\" width=\"60px\" alt=\"User avatar: miyanokomiya\" /></a><a href=\"https://github.com/AceofSpades5757\"><img src=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AceofSpades5757.png\" width=\"60px\" alt=\"User avatar: Kyle L.

      "readme": "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qeeqbox/social-analyzer/main/readme/socialanalyzerlogo_.png\"></p>\n\nSocial Analyzer - API, CLI, and Web App for analyzing & finding a person's profile across +1000 social media \\ websites. It includes different analysis and detection modules, and you can choose which modules to use during the investigation process.\n\nThe detection modules utilize a rating mechanism based on different detection techniques, which produces a rate value that starts from 0 to 100 (No-Maybe-Yes). This module is intended to have fewer false positives.\n\nThe analysis and public extracted information from this OSINT tool could help investigate profiles related to suspicious or malicious activities such as cyberbullying, cyber grooming, cyberstalking, and spreading misinformation.\n\n`This project is currently used by some law enforcement agencies in countries where resources are limited - The detection database is different than the one shared here..`\n\n## So·cial Me·di·a\nWebsites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking - Oxford Dictionary\n\n## Structure\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qeeqbox/social-analyzer/main/readme/structure.png\">\n\n\n## APP (Preferred!)\nStandard localhost WEB APP

src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qeeqbox/social-analyzer/main/readme/cli.gif\" style=\"max-width:768px\"/>\n\n## Features\n- String & name analysis (Permutations and Combinations)\n- Find a profile using multiple techniques (HTTPS library & Webdriver)\n- Multi profile search (Used for correlation - any combination separated with \",\" )\n- Multilayers detections (OCR, normal, advanced & special)\n- Visualized profile information using Ixora (Metadata & Patterns)\n- Metadata & Patterns extraction (Added from Qeeqbox OSINT project)\n- Force-directed Graph for Metadata (Needs ExtractPatterns)\n- Search by top ranking or by country (Alexa Ranking)\n- Search by type (adult, music, etc.. - automated websites stats)\n- Profiles stats and static info (Category country)\n- Cross Metadata stats (Added from Qeeqbox OSINT project)\n- Auto-flirtation to unnecessary output (Enable javascript etc..)\n- Search engine lookup (Google API - optional)\n- Custom search queries (Google API & DuckDuckGo API - optional)\n- Profile screenshot, title, info, and website description\n- Find name origins, name similarity & common words by language\n- Find possible profile\\person age (Limited analysis)\n- Custom user-agent, proxy, timeout & implicit wait\n- Python CLI & NodeJS CLI (limited to FindUserProfilesFast option)\n- Screenshots of detected profile (The latest version of Chrome must be installed)\n- Grid option for faster checking (limited to docker-compose)\n- Dump logs to folder or terminal (prettified)\n- Adjust finding\\getting profile workers (default 15)\n- Re-checking option for failed profiles\n- Filter profiles by good, maybe, and bad\n- Save the analysis as a JSON file\n- Simplified web interface and CLI\n- And, more!!\n\n## Special Detections\n- Facebook (Phone number, name, or profile name)\n- Gmail (example@gmail.com)\n- Google (example@example.com)\n\n## Install & Run\n### Linux (As Node WebApp)\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\n#Depedning on

Fetch data and\nperform business logic with strong consistency by writing pure TypeScript.\n\nConvex provides a database, a place to write your server functions, and client\nlibraries. It makes it easy to build and scale dynamic live-updating apps.\n[Read the docs to learn more](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/).\n\nDevelopment of the Convex backend is led by the Convex team. We\n[welcome bug fixes](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and\n[love receiving feedback](https://discord.gg/convex). We keep this repository\nsynced with any internal development work within a handful of days.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nVisit our [documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/) to learn more about Convex\nand follow our getting started guides.\n\nThe easiest way to build with Convex is through our\n[cloud platform](https://www.convex.dev/plans), which includes a generous free\ntier and lets you focus on building your application without worrying about\ninfrastructure. Many small applications and side-projects can operate entirely\non the free tier with zero cost and zero maintenance.\n\n## Self Hosting\n\nThe self-hosted product includes most features of the cloud product, including\nthe dashboard and CLI. Self-hosted Convex works well with a variety of tools\nincluding Neon, Fly.io, Vercel, Netlify, RDS, Sqlite, Postgres, and more.\n\nYou can either use Docker (recommended) or a prebuilt binary to self host\nConvex. Check out our [self-hosting guide](./self-hosted/README.md) for detailed\ninstructions. Community support for self-hosting is available in the\n`#self-hosted` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/convex).\n\n## Community & Support\n\n- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/convex) for help and\n  discussions.\n- Report issues when building and using the open source Convex backend through\n  [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend/issues)\n- By submitting pull requests, you confirm that Convex can use, modify, copy,\n  and redistribute the contribution, under the terms of its choice.\n\n## Building from source\n\nSee [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md).\n\n## Disclaimers\n\n- If you choose to self-host, we recommend following the self-hosting guide. If\n  you are instead building from source, make sure to change your instance secret\n  and admin key from the defaults in the repo.\n- Convex is battle tested most thoroughly on Linux and Mac. On Windows, it has\n  less experience. If you run into issues, please message us on\n  [Discord](https://convex.dev/community) in the `#self-hosted` channel.\n- Convex self-hosted builds contain a beacon to help Convex improve the product.\n  The information is minimal and anonymous and helpful to Convex, but if you\n  really want to disable it, you can set the `--disable-beacon` flag on the\n  backend binary. The beacon's messages print in the log and only include\n  - A random identifier for your deployment (not used elsewhere)\n  - Migration version of your database\n  - Git rev of the backend\n  - Uptime of the backend\n\n## Repository layout\n\n- `crates/` contains Rust code\n\n  - Main binary\n    - `local_backend/` is an application server on top of the `Runtime`. This is\n      the serving edge for the Convex cloud.\n\n- `npm-packages/` contains both our public and internal TypeScript packages.\n  - Internal packages\n    - `udf-runtime/` sets up the user-defined functions JS environment for\n      queries and mutations\n    - `udf-tests/` is a collection of functions used in testing the isolate\n      layer\n    - `system-udfs/` contains functions used by the Convex system e.g. the CLI\n",

Additionally, Qt 6.7+ is required for the GUI.\nLinux users with systems not meeting these requirements should use flatpak in place of a native package.\n\nWe officially support FreeBSD, and would also like to support: OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly, Solaris.\n\n## Repology\n\nRepology monitors a huge number of package repositories and other sources comparing package\nversions across them and gathering other information.\n\n[![Repology](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/deskflow.svg?exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/deskflow/versions)\n\n**Note:** We are working with package maintainers to have our new package name adopted.\n\n## Installing on macOS\n\nWhen you install Deskflow on macOS, you need to allow accessibility access (Privacy & Security) to both the `Deskflow` app and the `deskflow` process.\n\nIf using Sequoia, you may also need to allow `Deskflow` under Local Network‍ settings (Privacy & Security).\nWhen prompted by the OS, go to the settings and enable the access.\n\nIf you are upgrading and you already have `Deskflow` or `deskflow`\non the allowed list you will need to manually remove them before accessibility access can be granted to the new version.\n\nmacOS users who download directly from releases may need to run `xattr -c /Applications/Deskflow.app` after copying the app to the `Applications` dir.\n\nIt is recommend to install Deskflow using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) from our [homebrew-tap](https://github.com/deskflow/homebrew-tap)\n\nTo add our tap, run:\n\n```\nbrew tap deskflow/tap\n```\n\nThen install either:\n\n- Stable: `brew install deskflow`\n- Continuous: `brew install deskflow-dev`\n\n## Similar Projects\n\nIn the open source developer community, similar projects collaborate for the improvement of all\nmouse and keyboard sharing tools. We aim for idea sharing and interoperability.\n\n- [**Lan Mouse**](https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse) -\n  Rust implementation with the goal of having native front-ends and interoperability with\n  Deskflow/Synergy.\n- [**Synergy**](https://symless.com/synergy) -\n  Downstream commercial fork. Synergy sponsors Deskflow with financial support and contributes code ([learn more](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/wiki/Relationship-with-Synergy)).\n- [**Input Leap**](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap) -\n  Inactive Deskflow/Synergy-derivative with the goal continuing Barrier development (now a dead fork).\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Is Deskflow compatible with Synergy, Input Leap, or Barrier?\n\nYes, Deskflow has network compatibility with all forks:\n\n- Requires Deskflow >= v1.17.0.96\n- Deskflow will _just work_ with Input Leap and Barrier (server or client).\n- Connecting a Deskflow client to a Synergy 1 server will also _just work_.\n- To connect a Synergy 1 client, you need to select the Synergy protocol in the Deskflow server settings.\n\n_Note:_ Only Synergy 1 is compatible with Deskflow (Synergy 3 is not yet compatible).\n\n### Is Deskflow compatible with Lan Mouse?\n\nWe would love to see compatibility with Lan Mouse. This may be quite an effort as currently the way they handle the generated input is very different.\n\n### If I want to solve issues in Deskflow do I need to contribute to a fork?\n\nWe welcome PRs (pull requests) from the community. If you'd like to make a change, please feel\nfree to [start a discussion](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/discussions) or\n[open a PR](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/wiki/Contributing).\n\n### Is clipboard sharing supported?\n\nAbsolutely. The clipboard-sharing feature is a cornerstone feature of the product and we are\ncommitted to maintaining and improving that feature.\n\n### Is Wayland for Linux supported?\n\nYes! Wayland (the Linux display server protocol aimed to become the successor of the X Window\nSystem) is an important platform for us.\nThe [`libei`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libei) and\n[`libportal`](https://github.com/flatpak/libportal) libraries enable\nWayland support for Deskflow.

安装服务\ncrs start     # 启动服务\ncrs stop      # 停止服务\ncrs restart   # 重启服务\ncrs status    # 查看状态\ncrs update    # 更新服务\ncrs uninstall # 卸载服务\n```\n\n### 安装示例\n\n```bash\n$ crs install\n\n# 会依次询问：\n安装目录 (默认: ~/claude-relay-service):\n服务端口 (默认: 3000): 8080\nRedis 地址 (默认: localhost):\nRedis 端口 (默认: 6379):\nRedis 密码 (默认: 无密码):\n\n# 安装完成后自动启动并显示：\n服务已成功安装并启动！\n\n访问地址：\n  本地 Web: http://localhost:8080/web\n  公网 Web: http://YOUR_IP:8080/web\n\n管理员账号信息已保存到: data/init.json\n```\n\n### 系统要求\n\n- 支持系统: Ubuntu/Debian、CentOS/RedHat、Arch Linux、macOS\n- 自动安装 Node.js 18+ 和 Redis\n- Redis 使用系统默认位置，数据独立于应用\n\n---\n\n## 📦 手动部署\n\n### 第一步：环境准备\n\n**Ubuntu/Debian用户：**\n\n```bash\n# 安装Node.js\ncurl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n# 安装Redis\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install redis-server\nsudo systemctl start redis-server\n```\n\n**CentOS/RHEL用户：**\n\n```bash\n# 安装Node.js\ncurl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash -\nsudo yum install -y nodejs\n\n# 安装Redis\nsudo yum install redis\nsudo systemctl start redis\n```\n\n### 第二步：下载和配置\n\n```bash\n# 下载项目\ngit clone https://github.com/Wei-Shaw//claude-relay-service.git\ncd claude-relay-service\n\n# 安装依赖\nnpm install\n\n# 复制配置文件（重要！）\ncp config/config.example.js config/config.js\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\n### 第三步：配置文件设置\n\n**编辑 `.env` 文件：**\n\n```bash\n# 这两个密钥随便生成，但要记住\nJWT_SECRET=你的超级秘密密钥\nENCRYPTION_KEY=32位的加密密钥随便写\n\n# Redis配置\nREDIS_HOST=localhost\nREDIS_PORT=6379\nREDIS_PASSWORD=\n\n```\n\n**编辑 `config/config.js` 文件：**\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  server: {\n    port: 3000, // 服务端口，可以改\n    host: '0.0.0.0' // 不用改\n  },\n  redis: {\n    host: '127.0.0.1', // Redis地址\n    port: 6379 // Redis端口\n  }\n  // 其他配置保持默认就行\n}\n```\n\n### 第四步：安装前端依赖并构建\n\n```bash\n# 安装前端依赖\nnpm run install:web\n\n# 构建前端（生成 dist 目录）\nnpm run build:web\n```\n\n### 第五步：启动服务\n\n```bash\n# 初始化\nnpm run setup # 会随机生成后台账号密码信息，存储在 data/init.json\n# 或者通过环境变量预设管理员凭据：\n# export ADMIN_USERNAME=cr_admin_custom\n# export ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password\n\n# 启动服务\nnpm run service:start:daemon   # 后台运行\n\n# 查看状态\nnpm run service:status\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🐳 Docker 部署\n\n### Docker compose\n\n#### 第一步：下载构建docker-compose.yml文件的脚本并执行\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://pincc.ai/crs-compose.sh -o crs-compose.sh && chmod +x crs-compose.sh && ./crs-compose.sh\n```\n\n#### 第二步：启动\n```bash\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n### Docker Compose 配置\n\ndocker-compose.yml 已包含：\n\n- ✅ 自动初始化管理员账号\n- ✅ 数据持久化（logs和data目录自动挂载）\n- ✅ Redis数据库\n- ✅ 健康检查\n- ✅ 自动重启\n\n### 环境变量说明\n\n#### 必填项\n\n- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT密钥，至少32个字符\n- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: 加密密钥，必须是32个字符\n\n#### 可选项\n\n- `ADMIN_USERNAME`: 管理员用户名（不设置则自动生成）\n- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: 管理员密码（不设置则自动生成）\n- `LOG_LEVEL`: 日志级别（默认：info）\n- 更多配置项请参考 `.env.example` 文件\n\n### 管理员凭据获取方式\n\n1. **查看容器日志**\n\n   ```bash\n   docker logs claude-relay-service\n   ```\n\n2. **查看挂载的文件**\n\n   ```bash\n   cat ./data/init.json\n   ```\n\n3. **使用环境变量预设**\n   ```bash\n   # 在 .env 文件中设置\n   ADMIN_USERNAME=cr_admin_custom\n   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## 🎮 开始使用\n\n### 1. 打开管理界面\n\n浏览器访问：`http://你的服务器IP:3000/web`\n\n管理员账号：\n\n- 自动生成：查看 data/init.json\n- 环境变量预设：通过 ADMIN_USERNAME 和 ADMIN_PASSWORD 设置\n- Docker 部署：查看容器日志 `docker logs claude-relay-service`\n\n### 2. 添加Claude账户\n\n这一步比较关键，需要OAuth授权：\n\n1. 点击「Claude账户」标签\n2. 如果你担心多个账号共用1个IP怕被封禁，可以选择设置静态代理IP（可选）\n3. 点击「添加账户」\n4. 点击「生成授权链接」，会打开一个新页面\n5. 在新页面完成Claude登录和授权\n6. 复制返回的Authorization Code\n7. 粘贴到页面完成添加\n\n**注意**: 如果你在国内，这一步可能需要科学上网。\n\n### 3. 创建API Key\n\n给每个使用者分配一个Key：\n\n1. 点击「API Keys」标签\n2. 点击「创建新Key」\n3. 给Key起个名字，比如「张三的Key」\n4. 设置使用限制（可选）：\n   - **速率限制**: 限制每个时间窗口的请求次数和Token使用量\n   - **并发限制**: 限制同时处理的请求数\n   - **模型限制**: 限制可访问的模型列表\n   - **客户端限制**: 限制只允许特定客户端使用（如ClaudeCode、Gemini-CLI等）\n5. 保存，记下生成的Key\n\n### 4. 开始使用 Claude Code 和 Gemini CLI\n\n现在你可以用自己的服务替换官方API了：\n\n**Claude Code 设置环境变量：**\n\n默认使用标准 Claude 账号池：\n\n```bash\nexport ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=\"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/\" # 根据实际填写你服务器的ip地址或者域名\nexport ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=\"后台创建的API密钥\"\n```\n\n**VSCode Claude 插件配置：**\n\n如果使用 VSCode 的 Claude 插件，需要在 `~/.claude/config.json` 文件中配置：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primaryApiKey\": \"crs\"\n}\n```\n\n如果该文件不存在，请手动创建。Windows 用户路径为 `C:\\Users\\你的用户名\\.claude\\config.json`。\n\n> 💡 **IntelliJ IDEA 用户推荐**：[Claude Code Plus](https://github.com/touwaeriol/claude-code-plus) - 将 Claude Code 直接集成到 IDE，支持代码理解、文件读写、命令执行。插件市场搜索 `Claude Code Plus` 即可安装。\n\n**Gemini CLI 设置环境变量：**\n\n**方式一（推荐）：通过 Gemini Assist API 方式访问**\n\n```bash\nCODE_ASSIST_ENDPOINT=\"http://127.0.0.1:3000/gemini\"  # 根据实际填写你服务器的ip地址或者域名\nGOOGLE_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN=\"后台创建的API密钥\"\nGOOGLE_GENAI_USE_GCA=\"true\"\nGEMINI_MODEL=\"gemini-2.5-pro\" # 如果你有gemini3权限可以填： gemini-3-pro-preview\n```\n\n> **认证**：只能选 ```Login with Google``` 进行认证，如果跳 Google请删除 ```~/.gemini/settings.json``` 后再尝试启动```gemini```。  \n> **注意**：gemini-cli 控制台会提示 `Failed to fetch user info: 401 Unauthorized`，但使用不受任何影响。  \n\n**方式二：通过 Gemini API 方式访问**\n\n\n```bash\nGOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL=\"http://127.0.0.1:3000/gemini\"  # 根据实际填写你服务器的ip地址或者域名\nGEMINI_API_KEY=\"后台创建的API密钥\"\nGEMINI_MODEL=\"gemini-2.5-pro\" # 如果你有gemini3权限可以填： gemini-3-pro-preview\n```\n\n> **认证**：只能选 ```Use Gemini API Key``` 进行认证，如果提示 ```Enter Gemini API Key``` 请直接留空按回车。如果一打开就跳 Google请删除 ```~/.gemini/settings.json``` 后再尝试启动```gemini```。\n\n> 💡 **进阶用法**：想在 Claude Code 中直接使用 Gemini 3 模型？请参考 [Claude Code 调用 Gemini 3 模型指南](docs/claude-code-gemini3-guide/README.md)\n\n**使用 Claude Code：**\n\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n\n**使用 Gemini CLI：**\n\n```bash\ngemini  # 或其他 Gemini CLI 命令\n```\n\n**Codex 配置：**\n\n在 `~/.codex/config.toml` 文件**开头**添加以下配置：\n\n```toml\nmodel_provider = \"crs\"\nmodel = \"gpt-5.1-codex-max\"\nmodel_reasoning_effort = \"high\"\ndisable_response_storage = true\npreferred_auth_method = \"apikey\"\n\n[model_providers.crs]\nname = \"crs\"\nbase_url = \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/openai\"  # 根据实际填写你服务器的ip地址或者域名\nwire_api = \"responses\"\nrequires_openai_auth = true\nenv_key = \"CRS_OAI_KEY\"\n```\n\n在 `~/.codex/auth.json` 文件中配置API密钥为 null：\n\n```json\n{\n    \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": null  \n}\n```\n\n环境变量设置：\n\n```bash\nexport CRS_OAI_KEY=\"后台创建的API密钥\"\n```\n\n> ⚠️ 在通过 Nginx 反向代理 CRS 服务并使用 Codex CLI 时，需要在 http 块中添加 underscores_in_headers on;。因为 Nginx 默认会移除带下划线的请求头（如 session_id），一旦该头被丢弃，多账号环境下的粘性会话功能将失效。\n\n**Droid CLI 配置：**\n\nDroid CLI 读取 `~/.factory/config.json`。可以在该文件中添加自定义模型以指向本服务的新端点：\n\n```json\n{\n  \"custom_models\": [\n    {\n      \"model_display_name\": \"Opus 4.5 [crs]\",\n      \"model\": \"claude-opus-4-5-20251101\",\n      \"base_url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/droid/claude\",\n      \"api_key\": \"后台创建的API密钥\",\n      \"provider\": \"anthropic\",\n      \"max_tokens\": 64000\n    },\n    {\n      \"model_display_name\": \"GPT5-Codex [crs]\",\n      \"model\": \"gpt-5-codex\",\n      \"base_url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/droid/openai\",\n      \"api_key\": \"后台创建的API密钥\",\n      \"provider\": \"openai\",\n      \"max_tokens\": 16384\n    },\n    {\n      \"model_display_name\": \"Gemini-3-Pro [crs]\",\n      \"model\": \"gemini-3-pro-preview\",\n      \"base_url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/droid/comm/v1/\",\n      \"api_key\": \"后台创建的API密钥\",\n      \"provider\": \"generic-chat-completion-api\",\n      \"max_tokens\": 65535\n    },\n    {\n      \"model_display_name\": \"GLM-4.6 [crs]\",\n      \"model\": \"glm-4.6\",\n      \"base_url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/droid/comm/v1/\",\n      \"api_key\": \"后台创建的API密钥\",\n      \"provider\": \"generic-chat-completion-api\",\n      \"max_tokens\": 202800\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> 💡 将示例中的 `http://127.0.0.1:3000` 替换为你的服务域名或公网地址，并写入后台生成的 API 密钥（cr_ 开头）。\n\n### 5. 第三方工具API接入\n\n本服务支持多种API端点格式，方便接入不同的第三方工具（如Cherry Studio等）。\n\n#### Cherry Studio 接入示例\n\nCherry Studio支持多种AI服务的接入，下面是不同账号类型的详细配置：\n\n**1.

Caddy 配置**\n\n编辑 `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` ：\n\n```caddy\nyour-domain.com {\n    # 反向代理到本地服务\n    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000 {\n        # 支持流式响应或 SSE\n        flush_interval -1\n\n        # 传递真实 IP\n        header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}\n        header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote_host}\n        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}\n\n        # 长读/写超时配置\n        transport http {\n            read_timeout 300s\n            write_timeout 300s\n            dial_timeout 30s\n        }\n    }\n\n    # 安全头部\n    header {\n        Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\"\n        X-Frame-Options \"DENY\"\n        X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\"\n        -Server\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**3. 启动 Caddy**\n\n```bash\nsudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile\nsudo systemctl start caddy\nsudo systemctl enable caddy\nsudo systemctl status caddy\n```\n\n**4. 服务配置**\n\nCaddy 会自动管理 HTTPS，因此可以将服务限制在本地进行监听：\n\n```javascript\n// config/config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  server: {\n    port: 3000,\n    host: '127.0.0.1' // 只监听本地\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Caddy 特点**\n\n* 🔒 自动 HTTPS，零配置证书管理\n* 🛡️ 安全默认配置，启用现代 TLS 套件\n* ⚡ HTTP/2 和流式传输支持\n* 🔧 配置文件简洁，易于维护\n\n---\n\n## Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) 方案\n\nNginx Proxy Manager 通过图形化界面管理反向代理和 HTTPS 证书，並以 Docker 容器部署。\n\n**1. 在 NPM 创建新的 Proxy Host**\n\nDetails 配置如下：\n\n| 项目                    | 设置                      |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------- |\n| Domain Names          | relay.example.com       |\n| Scheme                | http                    |\n| Forward Hostname / IP | 192.168.0.1 (docker 机器 IP) |\n| Forward Port          | 3000                    |\n| Block Common Exploits | ☑️                      |\n| Websockets Support    | ❌ **关闭**                |\n| Cache Assets          | ❌ **关闭**                |\n| Access List           | Publicly Accessible     |\n\n> 注意：\n> - 请确保 Claude Relay Service **监听 host 为 `0.0.0.0` 、容器 IP 或本机 IP**，以便 NPM 实现内网连接。\n> - **Websockets Support 和 Cache Assets 必须关闭**，否则会导致 SSE / 流式响应失败。\n\n**2. Custom locations**\n\n無需添加任何内容，保持为空。\n\n**3. SSL 设置**\n\n* **SSL Certificate**: Request a new SSL Certificate (Let's Encrypt) 或已有证书\n* ☑️ **Force SSL**\n* ☑️ **HTTP/2 Support**\n* ☑️ **HSTS Enabled**\n* ☑️ **HSTS Subdomains**\n\n**4. Advanced 配置**\n\nCustom Nginx Configuration 中添加以下内容：\n\n```nginx\n# 传递真实用户 IP\nproxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\nproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n\n# 支持 WebSocket / SSE 等流式通信\nproxy_http_version 1.1;\nproxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\nproxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\nproxy_buffering off;\n\n# 长连接 / 超时设置（适合 AI 聊天流式传输）\nproxy_read_timeout 300s;\nproxy_send_timeout 300s;\nproxy_connect_timeout 30s;\n\n# ---- 安全性设置 ----\n# 严格 HTTPS 策略 (HSTS)\nadd_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\" always;\n\n# 阻挡点击劫持与内容嗅探\nadd_header X-Frame-Options \"DENY\" always;\nadd_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\" always;\n\n# Referrer / Permissions 限制策略\nadd_header Referrer-Policy \"no-referrer-when-downgrade\" always;\nadd_header Permissions-Policy \"camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()\" always;\n\n# 隐藏服务器信息（等效于 Caddy 的 `-Server`）\nproxy_hide_header Server;\n\n# ---- 性能微调 ----\n# 关闭代理端缓存，确保即时响应（SSE / Streaming）\nproxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\nproxy_no_cache $http_upgrade;\nproxy_request_buffering off;\n```\n\n**4. 启动和验证**\n\n* 保存后等待 NPM 自动申请 Let's Encrypt 证书（如果有）。\n* Dashboard 中查看 Proxy Host 状态，确保显示为 \"Online\"。\n* 访问 `https://relay.example.com`，如果显示绿色锁图标即表示 HTTPS 正常。\n\n**NPM 特点**\n\n* 🔒 自动申请和续期证书\n* 🔧 图形化界面，方便管理多服务\n* ⚡ 原生支持 HTTP/2 / HTTPS\n* 🚀 适合 Docker 容器部署\n\n---\n\n上述两种方案均可用于生产部署。\n\n---\n\n## 💡 使用建议\n\n### 账户管理\n\n- **定期检查**: 每周看看账户状态，及时处理异常\n- **合理分配**: 可以给不同的人分配不同的apikey，可以根据不同的apikey来分析用量\n\n### 安全建议\n\n- **使用HTTPS**: 强烈建议使用Caddy反向代理（自动HTTPS），确保数据传输安全\n- **定期备份**: 重要配置和数据要备份\n- **监控日志**: 定期查看异常日志\n- **更新密钥**: 定期更换JWT和加密密钥\n- **防火墙设置**: 只开放必要的端口（80, 443），隐藏直接服务端口\n\n---\n\n## 🆘 遇到问题怎么办？\n\n### 自助排查\n\n1. **查看日志**: `logs/` 目录下的日志文件\n2. **检查配置**: 确认配置文件设置正确\n3. **测试连通性**: 用 curl 测试API是否正常\n4. **重启服务**: 有时候重启一下就好了\n\n### 寻求帮助\n\n- **GitHub Issues**: 提交详细的错误信息\n- **查看文档**: 仔细阅读错误信息和文档\n- **社区讨论**: 看看其他人是否遇到类似问题\n\n---\n\n## ❤️ 赞助支持\n\n如果您觉得这个项目对您有帮助，请考虑赞助支持项目的持续开发。您的支持是我们最大的动力！\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n<a href=\"https://afdian.com/a/claude-relay-service\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/请我喝杯咖啡-爱发电-946ce6?style=for-the-badge&logo=buy-me-a-coffee&logoColor=white\" alt=\"Sponsor\">\n</a>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><img src=\"docs/sponsoring/wechat.jpg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"wechat\" /></td>\n    <td><img src=\"docs/sponsoring/alipay.jpg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"alipay\" /></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## 📄 许可证\n\n本项目采用 [MIT许可证](LICENSE)。\n\n---\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n**⭐ 觉得有用的话给个Star呗，这是对作者最大的鼓励！**\n\n**🤝 有问题欢迎提Issue，有改进建议欢迎PR**\n\n</div>\n",

Your insights could help others make better use of\nRepomix.\n\n### Output File Format\n\nRepomix generates a single file with clear separators between different parts of your codebase.  \nTo enhance AI comprehension, the output file begins with an AI-oriented explanation, making it easier for AI models to\nunderstand the context and structure of the packed repository.\n\n#### XML Format (default)\n\nThe XML format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:\n\n```xml\nThis file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.\n\n<file_summary>\n  (Metadata and usage AI instructions)\n</file_summary>\n\n<directory_structure>\nsrc/\ncli/\ncliOutput.ts\nindex.ts\n\n(...remaining directories)\n</directory_structure>\n\n<files>\n<file path=\"src/index.js\">\n  // File contents here\n</file>\n\n(...remaining files)\n</files>\n\n<instruction>\n(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)\n</instruction>\n```\n\nFor those interested in the potential of XML tags in AI contexts:  \nhttps://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags\n\n> When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a\n> game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.\n\nThis means that the XML output from Repomix is not just a different format, but potentially a more effective way to feed\nyour codebase into AI systems for analysis, code review, or other tasks.\n\n#### Markdown Format\n\nTo generate output in Markdown format, use the `--style markdown` option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --style markdown\n```\n\nThe Markdown format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:\n\n````markdown\nThis file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.\n\n# File Summary\n\n(Metadata and usage AI instructions)\n\n# Repository Structure\n\n```\nsrc/\n  cli/\n    cliOutput.ts\n    index.ts\n```\n\n(...remaining directories)\n\n# Repository Files\n\n## File: src/index.js\n\n```\n// File contents here\n```\n\n(...remaining files)\n\n# Instruction\n\n(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)\n````\n\nThis format provides a clean, readable structure that is both human-friendly and easily parseable by AI systems.\n\n#### JSON Format\n\nTo generate output in JSON format, use the `--style json` option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --style json\n```\n\nThe JSON format structures the content as a hierarchical JSON object with camelCase property names:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"fileSummary\": {\n    \"generationHeader\": \"This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document by Repomix.\",\n    \"purpose\": \"This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents...\",\n    \"fileFormat\": \"The content is organized as follows...\",\n    \"usageGuidelines\": \"- This file should be treated as read-only...\",\n    \"notes\": \"- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore, .ignore, and .repomixignore rules...\"\n  },\n  \"userProvidedHeader\": \"Custom header text if specified\",\n  \"directoryStructure\": \"src/\\n  cli/\\n    cliOutput.ts\\n    index.ts\\n  config/\\n    configLoader.ts\",\n  \"files\": {\n    \"src/index.js\": \"// File contents here\",\n    \"src/utils.js\": \"// File contents here\"\n  },\n  \"instruction\": \"Custom instructions from instructionFilePath\"\n}\n```\n\nThis format is ideal for:\n- **Programmatic processing**: Easy to parse and manipulate with JSON libraries\n- **API integration**: Direct consumption by web services and applications  \n- **AI tool compatibility**: Structured format for machine learning and AI systems\n- **Data analysis**: Straightforward extraction of specific information using tools like `jq`\n\n##### Working with JSON Output Using `jq`\n\nThe JSON format makes it easy to extract specific information programmatically:\n\n```bash\n# List all file paths\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[]'\n\n# Count total number of files\ncat repomix-output.json | jq '.files | keys | length'\n\n# Extract specific file content\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files[\"README.md\"]'\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files[\"src/index.js\"]'\n\n# Find files by extension\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | keys[] | select(endswith(\".ts\"))'\n\n# Get files containing specific text\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | select(.value | contains(\"function\")) | .key'\n\n# Extract directory structure\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.directoryStructure'\n\n# Get file summary information\ncat repomix-output.json | jq '.fileSummary.purpose'\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.fileSummary.generationHeader'\n\n# Extract user-provided header (if exists)\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.userProvidedHeader // \"No header provided\"'\n\n# Create a file list with sizes\ncat repomix-output.json | jq -r '.files | to_entries[] | \"\\(.key): \\(.value | length) characters\"'\n```\n\n#### Plain Text Format\n\nTo generate output in plain text format, use the `--style plain` option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --style plain\n```\n\n```text\nThis file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.\n\n================================================================\nFile Summary\n================================================================\n(Metadata

Custom output with compression\nrepomix --compress\n\n# Process specific files\nrepomix --include \"src/**/*.ts\" --ignore \"**/*.test.ts\"\n\n# Split output into multiple files (max size per part)\nrepomix --split-output 20mb\n\n# Remote repository with branch\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo/tree/main\n\n# Remote repository with commit\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo/commit/836abcd7335137228ad77feb28655d85712680f1\n\n# Remote repository with shorthand\nrepomix --remote user/repo\n```\n\n### Updating Repomix\n\nTo update a globally installed Repomix:\n\n```bash\n# Using npm\nnpm update -g repomix\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn global upgrade repomix\n\n# Using bun\nbun update -g repomix\n```\n\nUsing `npx repomix` is generally more convenient as it always uses the latest version.\n\n### Remote Repository Processing\n\nRepomix supports processing remote Git repositories without the need for manual cloning. This feature allows you to\nquickly analyze any public Git repository with a single command.\n\nTo process a remote repository, use the `--remote` option followed by the repository URL:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix\n```\n\nYou can also use GitHub's shorthand format:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --remote yamadashy/repomix\n```\n\nYou can specify the branch name, tag, or commit hash:\n\n```bash\n# Using --remote-branch option\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch main\n\n# Using branch's URL\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/tree/main\n```\n\nOr use a specific commit hash:\n\n```bash\n# Using --remote-branch option\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 935b695\n\n# Using commit's URL\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/commit/836abcd7335137228ad77feb28655d85712680f1\n```\n\n### Code Compression\n\nThe `--compress` option utilizes [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) to perform intelligent code extraction, focusing on essential function and class signatures while removing implementation details. This can help reduce token count while retaining important structural information.\n\n```bash\nrepomix --compress\n```\n\nFor example, this code:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';\n\n/**\n * Calculate the total price of shopping items\n */\nconst calculateTotal = (\n  items: ShoppingItem[]\n) => {\n  let total = 0;\n  for (const item of items) {\n    total += item.price * item.quantity;\n  }\n  return total;\n}\n\n// Shopping item interface\ninterface Item {\n  name: string;\n  price: number;\n  quantity: number;\n}\n```\n\nWill be compressed to:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ShoppingItem } from './shopping-item';\n⋮----\n/**\n * Calculate the total price of shopping items\n */\nconst calculateTotal = (\n  items: ShoppingItem[]\n) => {\n⋮----\n// Shopping item interface\ninterface Item {\n  name: string;\n  price: number;\n  quantity: number;\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is an experimental feature that we'll be actively improving based on user feedback and real-world usage\n\n### Token Count Optimization\n\nUnderstanding your codebase's token distribution is crucial for optimizing AI interactions. Use the `--token-count-tree` option to visualize token usage across your project:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --token-count-tree\n```\n\nThis displays a hierarchical view of your codebase with token counts:\n\n```\n🔢 Token Count Tree:\n────────────────────\n└── src/ (70,925 tokens)\n    ├── cli/ (12,714 tokens)\n    │   ├── actions/ (7,546 tokens)\n    │   └── reporters/ (990 tokens)\n    └── core/ (41,600 tokens)\n        ├── file/ (10,098 tokens)\n        └── output/ (5,808 tokens)\n```\n\nYou can also set a minimum token threshold to focus on larger files:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --token-count-tree 1000  # Only show files/directories with 1000+ tokens\n```\n\nThis helps you:\n- **Identify token-heavy files** that might exceed AI context limits\n- **Optimize file selection** using `--include` and `--ignore` patterns  \n- **Plan compression strategies** by targeting the largest contributors\n- **Balance content vs. context** when preparing code for AI analysis\n\n### Splitting Output for Large Codebases\n\nWhen working with large codebases, the packed output may exceed file size limits imposed by some AI tools (e.g., Google AI Studio's 1MB limit). Use `--split-output` to automatically split the output into multiple files:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --split-output 1mb\n```\n\nThis generates numbered files like:\n- `repomix-output.1.xml`\n- `repomix-output.2.xml`\n- `repomix-output.3.xml`\n\nSize can be specified with units: `500kb`, `1mb`, `2mb`, `1.5mb`, etc. Decimal values are supported.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Files are grouped by top-level directory to maintain context. A single file or directory will never be split across multiple output files.\n\n### MCP Server Integration\n\nRepomix supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), allowing AI assistants to directly interact with your codebase. When run as an MCP server, Repomix provides tools that enable AI assistants to package local or remote repositories for analysis without requiring manual file preparation.\n\n```bash\nrepomix --mcp\n```\n\n#### Configuring MCP Servers\n\nTo use Repomix as an MCP server with AI assistants like Claude, you need to configure the MCP settings:\n\n**For VS Code:**\n\nYou can install the Repomix MCP server in VS Code using one of these methods:\n\n1. **Using the Install Badge:**\n\n  [![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_Server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=repomix&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D)\n  [![Install in VS Code Insiders](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-Install_Server-24bfa5?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=repomix&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22repomix%22%2C%22--mcp%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n2. **Using the Command Line:**\n\n  ```bash\n  code --add-mcp '{\"name\":\"repomix\",\"command\":\"npx\",\"args\":[\"-y\",\"repomix\",\"--mcp\"]}'\n  ```\n\n  For VS Code Insiders:\n  ```bash\n  code-insiders --add-mcp '{\"name\":\"repomix\",\"command\":\"npx\",\"args\":[\"-y\",\"repomix\",\"--mcp\"]}'\n  ```\n\n**For Cline (VS Code extension):**\n\nEdit the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file:\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"repomix\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"repomix\",\n        \"--mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**For Cursor:**\n\nIn Cursor, add a new MCP server from `Cursor Settings` > `MCP` > `+ Add new global MCP server` with a configuration similar to Cline.\n\n**For Claude Desktop:**\n\nEdit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file with similar configuration to Cline's config.\n\n**For Claude Code:**\n\nTo configure Repomix as an MCP server in [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), use the following command:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add repomix -- npx -y repomix --mcp\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the official Repomix plugins (see [Claude Code Plugins](#claude-code-plugins) section below).\n\n**Using Docker instead of npx:**\n\nYou can use Docker as an alternative to npx for running Repomix as an MCP server:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"repomix-docker\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"ghcr.io/yamadashy/repomix\",\n        \"--mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce configured, your AI assistant can directly use Repomix's capabilities to analyze codebases without manual file preparation, making code analysis workflows more efficient.\n\n#### Available MCP Tools\n\nWhen running as an MCP server, Repomix provides the following tools:\n\n1. **pack_codebase**: Package a local code directory into a consolidated XML file for AI analysis\n  - Parameters:\n    - `directory`: Absolute path to the directory to pack\n    - `compress`: (Optional, default: false) Enable Tree-sitter compression to extract essential code signatures and structure while removing implementation details.

See [tiktoken model.py](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/main/tiktoken/model.py#L24) for encoding details. | `\"o200k_base\"`         |\n\nThe configuration file supports [JSON5](https://json5.org/) syntax, which allows:\n- Comments (both single-line and multi-line)\n- Trailing commas in objects and arrays\n- Unquoted property names\n- More relaxed string syntax\n\n### Schema Validation\n\nYou can enable schema validation for your configuration file by adding the `$schema` property:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json\",\n  \"output\": {\n    \"filePath\": \"repomix-output.xml\",\n    \"style\": \"xml\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis provides auto-completion and validation in editors that support JSON schema.\n\n### Example Configuration\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://repomix.com/schemas/latest/schema.json\",\n  \"input\": {\n    \"maxFileSize\": 50000000\n  },\n  \"output\": {\n    \"filePath\": \"repomix-output.xml\",\n    \"style\": \"xml\",\n    \"parsableStyle\": false,\n    \"compress\": false,\n    \"headerText\": \"Custom header information for the packed file.\",\n    \"fileSummary\": true,\n    \"directoryStructure\": true,\n    \"files\": true,\n    \"removeComments\": false,\n    \"removeEmptyLines\": false,\n    \"topFilesLength\": 5,\n    \"tokenCountTree\": false, // or true, or a number like 10 for minimum token threshold\n    \"showLineNumbers\": false,\n    \"truncateBase64\": false,\n    \"copyToClipboard\": false,\n    \"splitOutput\": null, // or a number like 1000000 for ~1MB per file\n    \"includeEmptyDirectories\": false,\n    \"git\": {\n      \"sortByChanges\": true,\n      \"sortByChangesMaxCommits\": 100,\n      \"includeDiffs\": false,\n      \"includeLogs\": false,\n      \"includeLogsCount\": 50\n    }\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"**/*\"],\n  \"ignore\": {\n    \"useGitignore\": true,\n    \"useDefaultPatterns\": true,\n    // Patterns can also be specified in .repomixignore\n    \"customPatterns\": [\n      \"additional-folder\",\n      \"**/*.log\"\n    ],\n  },\n  \"security\": {\n    \"enableSecurityCheck\": true\n  },\n  \"tokenCount\": {\n    \"encoding\": \"o200k_base\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Global Configuration\n\nTo create a global configuration file:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --init --global\n```\n\nThe global configuration file will be created in:\n\n- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Repomix\\repomix.config.json`\n- macOS/Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/repomix/repomix.config.json` or `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json`\n\nNote: Local configuration (if present) takes precedence over global configuration.\n\n### Include and Ignore\n\n#### Include Patterns\n\nRepomix now supports specifying files to include\nusing [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). This allows for more\nflexible and powerful file selection:\n\n- Use `**/*.js` to include all JavaScript files in any directory\n- Use `src/**/*` to include all files within the `src` directory and its subdirectories\n- Combine multiple patterns like `[\"src/**/*.js\", \"**/*.md\"]` to include JavaScript files in `src` and all Markdown\n  files\n\n#### Ignore Patterns\n\nRepomix offers multiple methods to set ignore patterns for excluding specific files or directories during the packing\nprocess:\n\n- **.gitignore**: By default, patterns listed in your project's `.gitignore` files and `.git/info/exclude` are used. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useGitignore` setting or the `--no-gitignore` cli option.\n- **.ignore**: You can use a `.ignore` file in your project root, following the same format as `.gitignore`. This file is respected by tools like ripgrep and the silver searcher, reducing the need to maintain multiple ignore files. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useDotIgnore` setting or the `--no-dot-ignore` cli option.\n- **Default patterns**: Repomix includes a default list of commonly excluded files and directories (e.g., node_modules,\n  .git, binary files). This feature can be controlled with the `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` setting or the `--no-default-patterns` cli option. Please\n  see [defaultIgnore.ts](src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) for more details.\n- **.repomixignore**: You can create a `.repomixignore` file in your project root to define Repomix-specific ignore\n  patterns. This file follows the same format as `.gitignore`.\n- **Custom patterns**: Additional ignore patterns can be specified using the `ignore.customPatterns` option in the\n  configuration file. You can overwrite this setting with the `-i, --ignore` command line option.\n\nPriority Order (from highest to lowest):\n\n1. Custom patterns (`ignore.customPatterns`)\n2. Ignore files (`.repomixignore`, `.ignore`, `.gitignore`, and `.git/info/exclude`):\n   - When in nested directories, files in deeper directories have higher priority\n   - When in the same directory, these files are merged in no particular order\n3. Default patterns (if `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` is true and `--no-default-patterns` is not used)\n\nThis approach allows for flexible file exclusion configuration based on your project's needs. It helps optimize the size\nof the generated pack file by ensuring the exclusion of security-sensitive files and large binary files, while\npreventing the leakage of confidential information.\n\nNote: Binary files are not included in the packed output by default, but their paths are listed in the \"Repository\nStructure\" section of the output file. This provides a complete overview of the repository structure while keeping the\npacked file efficient and text-based.\n\n### Custom Instruction\n\nThe `output.instructionFilePath` option allows you to specify a separate file containing detailed instructions or\ncontext about your project. This allows AI systems to understand the specific context and requirements of your project,\npotentially leading to more relevant and tailored analysis or suggestions.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this feature:\n\n1. Create a file named `repomix-instruction.md` in your project root:\n\n```markdown\n# Coding Guidelines\n\n- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide\n- Suggest splitting files into smaller, focused units when appropriate\n- Add comments for non-obvious logic. Keep all text in English\n- All new features should have corresponding unit tests\n\n# Generate Comprehensive Output\n\n- Include all content without abbreviation, unless specified otherwise\n- Optimize for handling large codebases while maintaining output quality\n```\n\n2. In your `repomix.config.json`, add the `instructionFilePath` option:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"output\": {\n    \"instructionFilePath\": \"repomix-instruction.md\",\n    // other options...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen Repomix generates the output, it will include the contents of `repomix-instruction.md` in a dedicated section.\n\nNote: The instruction content is appended at the end of the output file. This placement can be particularly effective\nfor AI systems. For those interested in understanding why this might be beneficial, Anthropic provides some insights in\ntheir documentation:  \nhttps://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/long-context-tips\n\n> Put long-form data at the top: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above\n> your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.\n> Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.\n\n### Comment Removal\n\nWhen `output.removeComments` is set to `true`, Repomix will attempt to remove comments from supported file types. This\nfeature can help reduce the size of the output file and focus on the essential code content.\n\nSupported languages include:  \nHTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Svelte, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C#, Java, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Shell,\nand YAML.\n\nNote: The comment removal process is conservative to avoid accidentally removing code. In complex cases, some comments\nmight be retained.\n\n## 🔍 Security Check\n\nRepomix includes a security check feature that uses [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) to detect\npotentially sensitive information in your files. This feature helps you identify possible security risks before sharing\nyour packed repository.\n\nThe security check results will be displayed in the CLI output after the packing process is complete. If any suspicious\nfiles are detected, you'll see a list of these files along with a warning message.\n\nExample output:\n\n```\n🔍 Security Check:\n──────────────────\n2 suspicious file(s) detected:\n1. src/utils/test.txt\n2. tests/utils/secretLintUtils.test.ts\n\nPlease review these files for potentially sensitive information.\n```\n\nBy default, Repomix's security check feature is enabled. You can disable it by setting `security.enableSecurityCheck` to\n`false` in your configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"security\": {\n    \"enableSecurityCheck\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr using the `--no-security-check` command line option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --no-security-check\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Disabling security checks may expose sensitive information. Use this option with caution and only when necessary, such\n> as when working with test files or documentation that contains example credentials.\n\n## 🤖 Using Repomix with GitHub Actions\n\nYou can also use Repomix in your GitHub Actions workflows. This is useful for automating the process of packing your codebase for AI analysis.\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Pack repository with Repomix\n  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main\n  with:\n    output: repomix-output.xml\n    style: xml\n```\n\nUse `--style` to generate output in different formats:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Pack repository with Repomix\n  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main\n  with:\n    output: repomix-output.md\n    style: markdown\n```\n\n```yaml\n- name: Pack repository with Repomix (JSON format)\n  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main\n  with:\n    output: repomix-output.json\n    style: json\n```\n\nPack specific directories with compression:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Pack repository with Repomix\n  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main\n  with:\n    directories: src tests\n    include: \"**/*.ts,**/*.md\"\n    ignore: \"**/*.test.ts\"\n    output: repomix-output.txt\n    compress: true\n```\n\nUpload the output file as an artifact:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Pack repository with Repomix\n  uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main\n  with:\n    directories: src\n    output: repomix-output.txt\n    compress: true\n\n- name: Upload Repomix output\n  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4\n  with:\n    name: repomix-output\n    path: repomix-output.txt\n```\n\nComplete workflow example:\n\n```yaml\nname: Pack repository with Repomix\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: [ main ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  pack-repo:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Pack repository with Repomix\n        uses: yamadashy/repomix/.github/actions/repomix@main\n        with:\n          output: repomix-output.xml\n\n      - name: Upload Repomix output\n        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4\n        with:\n          name: repomix-output.xml\n          path: repomix-output.xml\n          retention-days: 30\n```\n\nSee the complete workflow example [here](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/.github/workflows/pack-repository.yml).\n\n### Action Inputs\n\n| Name | Description | Default |\n|------|-------------|---------|\n| `directories` | Space-separated list of directories to process (e.g., `src tests docs`) | `.` |\n| `include` | Comma-separated glob patterns to include files (e.g., `**/*.ts,**/*.md`) | `\"\"` |\n| `ignore` | Comma-separated glob patterns to ignore files (e.g., `**/*.test.ts,**/node_modules/**`) | `\"\"` |\n| `output` | Relative path for the packed file (extension determines format: `.txt`, `.md`, `.xml`) | `repomix-output.xml` |\n| `compress` | Enable smart compression to reduce output size by pruning implementation details | `true` |\n| `style` | Output style (`xml`, `markdown`, `json`, `plain`) | `xml` |\n| `additional-args` | Extra raw arguments for the repomix CLI (e.g., `--no-file-summary --no-security-check`) | `\"\"` |\n| `repomix-version` | Version of the npm package to install (supports semver ranges, tags, or specific versions like `0.2.25`) | `latest` |\n\n### Action Outputs\n\n| Name | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `output_file` | Path to the generated output file. Can be used in subsequent steps for artifact upload, LLM processing, or other operations. The file contains a formatted representation of your codebase based on the specified options. |\n\n## 📚 Using Repomix as a Library\n\nIn addition to using Repomix as a CLI tool, you can also use it as a library in your Node.js applications.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install repomix\n```\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```javascript\nimport { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';\n\n// Process current directory with custom options\nasync function packProject() {\n  const options = {\n    output: 'output.xml',\n    style: 'xml',\n    compress: true,\n    quiet: true\n  } as CliOptions;\n  \n  const result = await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);\n  return result.packResult;\n}\n```\n\n### Process Remote Repository\n\n```javascript\nimport { runCli, type CliOptions } from 'repomix';\n\n// Clone and process a GitHub repo\nasync function processRemoteRepo(repoUrl) {\n  const options = {\n    remote: repoUrl,\n    output: 'output.xml',\n    compress: true\n  } as CliOptions;\n  \n  return await runCli(['.'], process.cwd(), options);\n}\n```\n\n### Using Core Components\n\nIf you need more control, you can use the low-level APIs:\n\n```javascript\nimport { searchFiles, collectFiles, processFiles, TokenCounter } from 'repomix';\n\nasync function analyzeFiles(directory) {\n  // Find and collect files\n  const { filePaths } = await searchFiles(directory, { /* config */ });\n  const rawFiles = await collectFiles(filePaths, directory);\n  const processedFiles = await processFiles(rawFiles, { /* config */ });\n  \n  // Count tokens\n  const tokenCounter = new TokenCounter('o200k_base');\n  \n  // Return analysis results\n  return processedFiles.map(file => ({\n    path: file.path,\n    tokens: tokenCounter.countTokens(file.content)\n  }));\n}\n```\n\nFor more examples, check the source code at [website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/website/server/src/remoteRepo.ts) which demonstrates how repomix.com uses the library.\n\n### Bundling\n\nWhen bundling repomix with tools like Rolldown or esbuild, some dependencies must remain external and WASM files need to be copied:\n\n**External dependencies (cannot be bundled):**\n- `tinypool` - Spawns worker threads using file paths\n- `tiktoken` - Loads WASM files dynamically at runtime\n\n**WASM files to copy:**\n- `web-tree-sitter.wasm` → Same directory as bundled JS (required for code compression feature)\n- Tree-sitter language files → Directory specified by `REPOMIX_WASM_DIR` environment variable\n\nFor a working example, see [website/server/scripts/bundle.mjs](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/website/server/scripts/bundle.mjs).\n\n## 🤝 Contribution\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community!

The library's initial versions (1.x) were intended to be a drop-in replacement for the Mapbox’s OSS version (1.x) with additional functionality, but have evolved a lot since then.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInclude the JavaScript and CSS files in the `<head>` of your HTML file.\n\n```html\n<script src='https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl@latest/dist/maplibre-gl.js'></script>\n<link href='https://unpkg.com/maplibre-gl@latest/dist/maplibre-gl.css' rel='stylesheet' />\n```\n\nInclude the following code in the `<body>` of your HTML file.\n\n```html\n<div id='map' style='width: 400px; height: 300px;'></div>\n<script>\nvar map = new maplibregl.Map({\n  container: 'map',\n  style: 'https://demotiles.maplibre.org/style.json', // stylesheet location\n  center: [-74.5, 40], // starting position [lng, lat]\n  zoom: 9 // starting zoom\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nEnjoy the map!\n\n<br />\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation for this library [is available here](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/API/).\n\nCheck out the features through [examples](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/examples/).\n\n| Showcases                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| ![Display a map](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/assets/examples/display-a-map.png)                           | ![Third party vector tile source](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/assets/examples/3d-terrain.png)                 |\n| ![Animate a series of images](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/assets/examples/animate-a-series-of-images.png) | ![Create a heatmap layer](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/assets/examples/create-a-heatmap-layer.png)             |\n| ![3D buildings](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/assets/examples/display-buildings-in-3d.png)                  | ![Visualize population density](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/assets/examples/visualize-population-density.png) |\n\n<br />\n\nWant an example?

has contributed to open source. The open source community is sad to part ways with them, but we simultaneously feel grateful for everything they already contributed. `mapbox-gl-js` 1.x is an open source achievement that now lives on as `maplibre-gl`. We're proud to develop on the shoulders of giants, thank you Mapbox 🙇🏽‍♀️.\n\nPlease keep in mind: Unauthorized backports are the biggest threat to the MapLibre project. It is unacceptable to backport code from mapbox-gl-js, which is not covered by the former BSD-3 license.

It allows you to directly access serialized data without parsing/unpacking it first, while still having great forwards/backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. Build the compiler for flatbuffers (`flatc`)\n\n    Use `cmake` to create the build files for your platform and then perform the compilation (Linux example).\n\n    ```\n    cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\"\n    make -j\n    ```\n\n2. Define your flatbuffer schema (`.fbs`)\n\n    Write the [schema](https://flatbuffers.dev/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html) to define the data you want to serialize. See [monster.fbs](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/master/samples/monster.fbs) for an example.\n\n3. Generate code for your language(s)\n\n    Use the `flatc` compiler to take your schema and generate language-specific code:\n\n    ```\n    ./flatc --cpp --rust monster.fbs\n    ```\n\n    Which generates `monster_generated.h` and `monster_generated.rs` files.\n\n4. Serialize data\n\n    Use the generated code, as well as the `FlatBufferBuilder` to construct your serialized buffer. ([`C++` example](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/master/samples/sample_binary.cpp#L24-L56))\n\n5. Transmit/store/save Buffer\n\n    Use your serialized buffer however you want. Send it to someone, save it for later, etc...\n\n6. Read the data\n\n    Use the generated accessors to read the data from the serialized buffer.\n\n    It doesn't need to be the same language/schema version, FlatBuffers ensures the data is readable across languages and schema versions. See the [`Rust` example](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/master/samples/sample_binary.rs#L92-L106) reading the data written by `C++`.\n\n## Documentation\n\n**Go to our [landing page][] to browse our documentation.**\n\n## Supported operating systems\n- Windows\n- macOS\n- Linux\n- Android\n- And any others with a recent C++ compiler (C++ 11 and newer)\n\n## Supported programming languages\n\nCode generation and runtime libraries for many popular languages.\n\n1.

More features, stability improvements, and other enhancements will follow.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What is Chrome MCP Server?\n\nChrome MCP Server is a Chrome extension-based **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that exposes your Chrome browser functionality to AI assistants like Claude, enabling complex browser automation, content analysis, and semantic search. Unlike traditional browser automation tools (like Playwright), **Chrome MCP Server** directly uses your daily Chrome browser, leveraging existing user habits, configurations, and login states, allowing various large models or chatbots to take control of your browser and truly become your everyday assistant.\n\n## ✨ New Features(2025/12/30)\n\n- **A New Visual Editor for Claude Code & Codex**, for more detail here: [VisualEditor](docs/VisualEditor.md)\n\n## ✨ Core Features\n\n- 😁 **Chatbot/Model Agnostic**: Let any LLM or chatbot client or agent you prefer automate your browser\n- ⭐️ **Use Your Original Browser**: Seamlessly integrate with your existing browser environment (your configurations, login states, etc.)\n- 💻 **Fully Local**: Pure local MCP server ensuring user privacy\n- 🚄 **Streamable HTTP**: Streamable HTTP connection method\n- 🏎 **Cross-Tab**: Cross-tab context\n- 🧠 **Semantic Search**: Built-in vector database for intelligent browser tab content discovery\n- 🔍 **Smart Content Analysis**: AI-powered text extraction and similarity matching\n- 🌐 **20+ Tools**: Support for screenshots, network monitoring, interactive operations, bookmark management, browsing history, and 20+ other tools\n- 🚀 **SIMD-Accelerated AI**: Custom WebAssembly SIMD optimization for 4-8x faster vector operations\n\n## 🆚 Comparison with Similar Projects\n\n| Comparison Dimension    | Playwright-based MCP Server                                                                                               | Chrome Extension-based MCP Server                                                                      |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Resource Usage**      | ❌ Requires launching independent browser process, installing Playwright dependencies, downloading browser binaries, etc. | ✅ No need to launch independent browser process, directly utilizes user's already open Chrome browser |\n| **User Session Reuse**  | ❌ Requires re-login                                                                                                      | ✅ Automatically uses existing login state                                                             |\n| **Browser Environment** | ❌ Clean environment lacks user settings                                                                                  | ✅ Fully preserves user environment                                                                    |\n| **API Access**          | ⚠️ Limited to Playwright API                                                                                              | ✅ Full access to Chrome native APIs                                                                   |\n| **Startup Speed**       | ❌ Requires launching browser process                                                                                     | ✅ Only needs to activate extension                                                                    |\n| **Response Speed**      | 50-200ms inter-process communication                                                                                      | ✅ Faster                                                                                              |\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js >= 20.0.0 and pnpm/npm\n- Chrome/Chromium browser\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Download the latest Chrome extension from GitHub**\n\nDownload link: https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome/releases\n\n2. **Install mcp-chrome-bridge globally**\n\nnpm\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g mcp-chrome-bridge\n```\n\npnpm\n\n```bash\n# Method 1: Enable scripts globally (recommended)\npnpm config set enable-pre-post-scripts true\npnpm install -g mcp-chrome-bridge\n\n# Method 2: Manual registration (if postinstall doesn't run)\npnpm install -g mcp-chrome-bridge\nmcp-chrome-bridge register\n```\n\n> Note: pnpm v7+ disables postinstall scripts by default for security. The `enable-pre-post-scripts` setting controls whether pre/post install scripts run. If automatic registration fails, use the manual registration command above.\n\n3. **Load Chrome Extension**\n   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`\n   - Enable \"Developer mode\"\n   - Click \"Load unpacked\" and select `your/dowloaded/extension/folder`\n   - Click the extension icon to open the plugin, then click connect to see the MCP configuration\n     <img width=\"475\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-06-09 15 52 06\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/241e57b8-c55f-41a4-9188-0367293dc5bc\" />\n\n### Usage with MCP Protocol Clients\n\n#### Using Streamable HTTP Connection (👍🏻 Recommended)\n\nAdd the following configuration to your MCP client configuration (using CherryStudio as an example):\n\n> Streamable HTTP connection method is recommended\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-mcp-server\": {\n      \"type\": \"streamableHttp\",\n      \"url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:12306/mcp\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Using STDIO Connection (Alternative)\n\nIf your client only supports stdio connection method, please use the following approach:\n\n1. First, check the installation location of the npm package you just installed\n\n```sh\n# npm check method\nnpm list -g mcp-chrome-bridge\n# pnpm check method\npnpm list -g mcp-chrome-bridge\n```\n\nAssuming the command above outputs the path: /Users/xxx/Library/pnpm/global/5\nThen your final path would be: /Users/xxx/Library/pnpm/global/5/node_modules/mcp-chrome-bridge/dist/mcp/mcp-server-stdio.js\n\n2. Replace the configuration below with the final path you just obtained\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"chrome-mcp-stdio\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"node\",\n        \"/Users/xxx/Library/pnpm/global/5/node_modules/mcp-chrome-bridge/dist/mcp/mcp-server-stdio.js\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\neg：config in augment:\n\n<img width=\"494\" alt=\"截屏2025-06-22 22 11 25\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48eefc0c-a257-4d3b-8bbe-d7ff716de2bf\" />\n\n## 🛠️ Available Tools\n\nComplete tool list: [Complete Tool List](docs/TOOLS.md)\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>📊 Browser Management (6 tools)</strong></summary>\n\n- `get_windows_and_tabs` -

This modality is much faster as it doesn't have the browser overhead. Still, it analyzes HTTP responses body as is, without any javascript or DOM rendering, potentially missing post-dom-rendered endpoints or asynchronous endpoint calls that might happen in complex web applications depending, for example, on browser-specific events.\n\n### Headless Mode\n\nHeadless mode hooks internal headless calls to handle HTTP requests/responses directly within the browser context. This offers two advantages:\n- The HTTP fingerprint (TLS and user agent) fully identify the client as a legitimate browser\n- Better coverage since the endpoints are discovered analyzing the standard raw response, as in the previous modality, and also the browser-rendered one with javascript enabled.\n\nHeadless crawling is optional and can be enabled using `-headless` option.\n\nHere are other headless CLI options -\n\n```console\nkatana -h headless\n\nFlags:\nHEADLESS:\n   -hl, -headless                    enable headless hybrid crawling (experimental)\n   -sc, -system-chrome               use local installed chrome browser instead of katana installed\n   -sb, -show-browser                show the browser on the screen with headless mode\n   -ho, -headless-options string[]   start headless chrome with additional options\n   -nos, -no-sandbox                 start headless chrome in --no-sandbox mode\n   -cdd, -chrome-data-dir string     path to store chrome browser data\n   -scp, -system-chrome-path string  use specified chrome browser for headless crawling\n   -noi, -no-incognito               start headless chrome without incognito mode\n   -cwu, -chrome-ws-url string       use chrome browser instance launched elsewhere with the debugger listening at this URL\n   -xhr, -xhr-extraction             extract xhr requests\n```\n\n*`-no-sandbox`*\n----\n\nRuns headless chrome browser with **no-sandbox** option, useful when running as root user.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -headless -no-sandbox\n```\n\n*`-no-incognito`*\n----\n\nRuns headless chrome browser without incognito mode, useful when using the local browser.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -headless -no-incognito\n```\n\n*`-headless-options`*\n----\n\nWhen crawling in headless mode, additional chrome options can be specified using `-headless-options`, for example -\n\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -headless -system-chrome -headless-options --disable-gpu,proxy-server=http://127.0.0.1:8080\n```\n\n\n## Scope Control\n\nCrawling can be endless if not scoped, as such katana comes with multiple support to define the crawl scope.\n\n*`-field-scope`*\n----\nMost handy option to define scope with predefined field name, `rdn` being default option for field scope.\n\n   - `rdn` - crawling scoped to root domain name and all subdomains (e.g. `*example.com`) (default)\n   - `fqdn` - crawling scoped to given sub(domain) (e.g. `www.example.com` or `api.example.com`)\n   - `dn` - crawling scoped to domain name keyword (e.g. `example`)\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -fs dn\n```\n\n\n*`-crawl-scope`*\n------\n\nFor advanced scope control, `-cs` option can be used that comes with **regex** support.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -cs login\n```\n\nFor multiple in scope rules, file input with multiline string / regex can be passed.\n\n```bash\n$ cat in_scope.txt\n\nlogin/\nadmin/\napp/\nwordpress/\n```\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -cs in_scope.txt\n```\n\n\n*`-crawl-out-scope`*\n-----\n\nFor defining what not to crawl, `-cos` option can be used and also support **regex** input.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -cos logout\n```\n\nFor multiple out of scope rules, file input with multiline string / regex can be passed.\n\n```bash\n$ cat out_of_scope.txt\n\n/logout\n/log_out\n```\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -cos out_of_scope.txt\n```\n\n*`-no-scope`*\n----\n\nKatana is default to scope `*.domain`, to disable this `-ns` option can be used and also to crawl the internet.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -ns\n```\n\n*`-display-out-scope`*\n----\n\nAs default, when scope option is used, it also applies for the links to display as output, as such **external URLs are default to exclude** and to overwrite this behavior, `-do` option can be used to display all the external URLs that exist in targets scoped URL / Endpoint.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -do\n```\n\nHere is all the CLI options for the scope control -\n\n\n```console\nkatana -h scope\n\nFlags:\nSCOPE:\n   -cs, -crawl-scope string[]       in scope url regex to be followed by crawler\n   -cos, -crawl-out-scope string[]  out of scope url regex to be excluded by crawler\n   -fs, -field-scope string         pre-defined scope field (dn,rdn,fqdn) (default \"rdn\")\n   -ns, -no-scope                   disables host based default scope\n   -do, -display-out-scope          display external endpoint from scoped crawling\n```\n\n\n## Crawler Configuration\n\nKatana comes with multiple options to configure and control the crawl as the way we want.\n\n*`-depth`*\n----\n\nOption to define the `depth` to follow the urls for crawling, the more depth the more number of endpoint being crawled + time for crawl.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -d 5\n```\n\n*`-js-crawl`*\n----\n\nOption to enable JavaScript file parsing + crawling the endpoints discovered in JavaScript files, disabled as default.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -jc\n```\n\n*`-crawl-duration`*\n----\n\nOption to predefined crawl duration, disabled as default.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -ct 2\n```\n\n*`-known-files`*\n----\nOption to enable crawling `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` file, disabled as default.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -kf robotstxt,sitemapxml\n```\n\n*`-automatic-form-fill`*\n----\n\nOption to enable automatic form filling for known / unknown fields, known field values can be customized as needed by updating form config file at `$HOME/.config/katana/form-config.yaml`.\n\nAutomatic form filling is experimental feature.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -aff\n```\n\n## Authenticated Crawling\n\nAuthenticated crawling involves including custom headers or cookies in HTTP requests to access protected resources. These headers provide authentication or authorization information, allowing you to crawl authenticated content / endpoint. You can specify headers directly in the command line or provide them as a file with katana to perform authenticated crawling.\n\n> **Note**: User needs to be manually perform the authentication and export the session cookie / header to file to use with katana.\n\n*`-headers`*\n----\n\nOption to add a custom header or cookie to the request. \n> Syntax of [headers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2) in the HTTP specification\n\nHere is an example of adding a cookie to the request:\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -H 'Cookie: usrsess=AmljNrESo'\n```\n\nIt is also possible to supply headers or cookies as a file. For example:\n\n```\n$ cat cookie.txt\n\nCookie: PHPSESSIONID=XXXXXXXXX\nX-API-KEY: XXXXX\nTOKEN=XX\n```\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -H cookie.txt\n```\n\n\nThere are more options to configure when needed, here is all the config related CLI options - \n\n```console\nkatana -h config\n\nFlags:\nCONFIGURATION:\n   -r, -resolvers string[]       list of custom resolver (file or comma separated)\n   -d, -depth int                maximum depth to crawl (default 3)\n   -jc, -js-crawl                enable endpoint parsing / crawling in javascript file\n   -ct, -crawl-duration int      maximum duration to crawl the target for\n   -kf, -known-files string      enable crawling of known files (all,robotstxt,sitemapxml)\n   -mrs, -max-response-size int  maximum response size to read (default 9223372036854775807)\n   -timeout int                  time to wait for request in seconds (default 10)\n   -aff, -automatic-form-fill    enable automatic form filling (experimental)\n   -fx, -form-extraction         enable extraction of form, input, textarea & select elements\n   -retry int                    number of times to retry the request (default 1)\n   -proxy string                 http/socks5 proxy to use\n   -H, -headers string[]         custom header/cookie to include in request\n   -config string                path to the katana configuration file\n   -fc, -form-config string      path to custom form configuration file\n   -flc, -field-config string    path to custom field configuration file\n   -s, -strategy string          Visit strategy (depth-first, breadth-first) (default \"depth-first\")\n```\n\n### Connecting to Active Browser Session\n\nKatana can also connect to active browser session where user is already logged in and authenticated. and use it for crawling. The only requirement for this is to start browser with remote debugging enabled.\n\nHere is an example of starting chrome browser with remote debugging enabled and using it with katana -\n\n**step 1) First Locate path of chrome executable**\n\n| Operating System | Chromium Executable Location | Google Chrome Executable Location |\n|------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Windows (64-bit) | `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chromium\\Application\\chrome.exe` | `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe` |\n| Windows (32-bit) | `C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chromium\\Application\\chrome.exe` | `C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe` |\n| macOS | `/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium` | `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome` |\n| Linux | `/usr/bin/chromium` | `/usr/bin/google-chrome` |\n\n**step 2) Start chrome with remote debugging enabled and it will return websocker url. For example, on MacOS, you can start chrome with remote debugging enabled using following command** -\n\n```console\n$ /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222\n\n\nDevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/c5316c9c-19d6-42dc-847a-41d1aeebf7d6\n```\n\n> Now login to the website you want to crawl and keep the browser open.\n\n**step 3) Now use the websocket url with katana to connect to the active browser session and crawl the website**\n\n```console\nkatana -headless -u https://tesla.com -cwu ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/c5316c9c-19d6-42dc-847a-41d1aeebf7d6 -no-incognito\n```\n\n> **Note**: you can use `-cdd` option to specify custom chrome data directory to store browser data and cookies but that does not save session data if cookie is set to `Session` only or expires after certain time.\n\n\n## Filters\n\n*`-field`*\n----\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Deprecated: use [**`-output-template`**](#-output-template) instead. The field flag is still supported for backward compatibility.\n\nKatana comes with built in fields that can be used to filter the output for the desired information, `-f` option can be used to specify any of the available fields.\n\n```\n   -f, -field string  field to display in output (url,path,fqdn,rdn,rurl,qurl,qpath,file,key,value,kv,dir,udir)\n```\n\nHere is a table with examples of each field and expected output when used - \n\n\n| FIELD   | DESCRIPTION                 | EXAMPLE                                                      |\n| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `url`   | URL Endpoint                | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/admin/login?user=admin&password=admin` |\n| `qurl`  | URL including query param   | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/admin/login.php?user=admin&password=admin` |\n| `qpath` | Path including query param  | `/login?user=admin&password=admin`                           |\n| `path`  | URL Path                    | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/admin/login`              |\n| `fqdn`  | Fully Qualified Domain name | `admin.projectdiscovery.io`                                  |\n| `rdn`   | Root Domain name            | `projectdiscovery.io`                                        |\n| `rurl`  | Root URL                    | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io`                          |\n| `ufile` | URL with File               | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/login.js`                 |\n| `file`  | Filename in URL             | `login.php`                                                  |\n| `key`   | Parameter keys in URL       | `user,password`                                              |\n| `value` | Parameter values in URL     | `admin,admin`                                                |\n| `kv`    | Keys=Values in URL          | `user=admin&password=admin`                                  |\n| `dir`   | URL Directory name          | `/admin/`                                                    |\n| `udir`  | URL with Directory          | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/admin/`                   |\n\nHere is an example of using field option to only display all the urls with query parameter in it -\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -f qurl -silent\n\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/en_au?redirect=no\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/en_nz?redirect=no\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/product/men_s-raven-lightweight-zip-up-bomber-jacket?sku=1740250-00-A\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/product/tesla-shop-gift-card?sku=1767247-00-A\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/product/men_s-chill-crew-neck-sweatshirt?sku=1740176-00-A\nhttps://www.tesla.com/about?redirect=no\nhttps://www.tesla.com/about/legal?redirect=no\nhttps://www.tesla.com/findus/list?redirect=no\n```\n\n### Custom Fields\n\nYou can create custom fields to extract and store specific information from page responses using regex rules. These custom fields are defined using a YAML config file and are loaded from the default location at `$HOME/.config/katana/field-config.yaml`. Alternatively, you can use the `-flc` option to load a custom field config file from a different location.\nHere is example custom field.\n\n```yaml\n- name: email\n  type: regex\n  regex:\n  - '([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)'\n  - '([a-zA-Z0-9+._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)'\n\n- name: phone\n  type: regex\n  regex:\n  - '\\d{3}-\\d{8}|\\d{4}-\\d{7}'\n```\n\nWhen defining custom fields, following attributes are supported:\n\n- **name** (required)\n\n> The value of **name** attribute is used as the `-field` cli option value.\n\n- **type** (required)\n\n> The type of custom attribute, currently supported option - `regex` \n\n- **part** (optional)\n\n> The part of the response to extract the information from. The default value is `response`, which includes both the header and body. Other possible values are `header` and `body`.\n\n- group (optional)\n\n> You can use this attribute to select a specific matched group in regex, for example: `group: 1`\n\n#### Running katana using custom field:\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -f email,phone\n```\n\n*`-store-field`*\n---\n\nTo compliment `field` option which is useful to filter output at run time, there is `-sf, -store-fields` option which works exactly like field option except instead of filtering, it stores all the information on the disk under `katana_field` directory sorted by target url. Use `-sfd` or `-store-field-dir` to store data in a different location.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -sf key,fqdn,qurl -silent\n```\n\n```bash\n$ ls katana_field/\n\nhttps_www.tesla.com_fqdn.txt\nhttps_www.tesla.com_key.txt\nhttps_www.tesla.com_qurl.txt\n```\n\nThe `-store-field` option can be useful for collecting information to build a targeted wordlist for various purposes, including but not limited to:\n\n- Identifying the most commonly used parameters\n- Discovering frequently used paths\n- Finding commonly used files\n- Identifying related or unknown subdomains\n\n### Katana Filters\n\n*`-extension-match`*\n---\n\nCrawl output can be easily matched for specific extension using `-em` option to ensure to display only output containing given extension.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -silent -em js,jsp,json\n```\n\n*`-extension-filter`*\n---\n\nCrawl output can be easily filtered for specific extension using `-ef` option which ensure to remove all the urls containing given extension.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -silent -ef css,txt,md\n\n```\n*`-no-default-ext-filter`*\n---\n\nKatana filters several extensions by default. This can be disabled with the `-ndef` option.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -silent -ndef\n```\n\n*`-match-regex`*\n---\nThe `-match-regex` or `-mr` flag allows you to filter output URLs using regular expressions. When using this flag, only URLs that match the specified regular expression will be printed in the output.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -mr 'https://shop\\.tesla\\.com/*' -silent\n```\n*`-filter-regex`*\n---\nThe `-filter-regex` or `-fr` flag allows you to filter output URLs using regular expressions. When using this flag, it will skip the URLs that are match the specified regular expression.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -fr 'https://www\\.tesla\\.com/*' -silent\n```\n\n### Advance Filtering\n\nKatana supports DSL-based expressions for advanced matching and filtering capabilities:\n\n- To match endpoints with a 200 status code:\n```shell\nkatana -u https://www.hackerone.com -mdc 'status_code == 200'\n```\n- To match endpoints that contain \"default\" and have a status code other than 403:\n```shell\nkatana -u https://www.hackerone.com -mdc 'contains(endpoint, \"default\") && status_code != 403'\n```\n- To match endpoints with PHP technologies:\n```shell\nkatana -u https://www.hackerone.com -mdc 'contains(to_lower(technologies), \"php\")'\n```\n- To filter out endpoints running on Cloudflare:\n```shell\nkatana -u https://www.hackerone.com -fdc 'contains(to_lower(technologies), \"cloudflare\")'\n```\nDSL functions can be applied to any keys in the jsonl output. For more information on available DSL functions, please visit the [dsl project](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dsl).\n\nHere are additional filter options -\n\n```console\nkatana -h filter\n\nFlags:\nFILTER:\n   -mr, -match-regex string[]             regex or list of regex to match on output url (cli, file)\n   -fr, -filter-regex string[]            regex or list of regex to filter on output url (cli, file)\n   -f, -field string                      field to display in output (url,path,fqdn,rdn,rurl,qurl,qpath,file,ufile,key,value,kv,dir,udir)\n   -sf, -store-field string               field to store in per-host output (url,path,fqdn,rdn,rurl,qurl,qpath,file,ufile,key,value,kv,dir,udir)\n   -em, -extension-match string[]         match output for given extension (eg, -em php,html,js)\n   -ef, -extension-filter string[]        filter output for given extension (eg, -ef png,css)\n   -ndef, -no-default-ext-filter bool     remove default extensions from the filter list\n   -mdc, -match-condition string          match response with dsl based condition\n   -fdc, -filter-condition string         filter response with dsl based condition\n   -duf, -disable-unique-filter           disable duplicate content filtering\n```\n\n\n## Rate Limit\n\nIt's easy to get blocked / banned while crawling if not following target websites limits, katana comes with multiple option to tune the crawl to go as fast / slow we want.\n\n*`-delay`*\n-----\n\noption to introduce a delay in seconds between each new request katana makes while crawling, disabled as default.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -delay 20\n```\n\n*`-concurrency`*\n-----\noption to control the number of urls per target to fetch at the same time.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -c 20\n```\n\n\n*`-parallelism`*\n-----\noption to define number of target to process at same time from list input.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -p 20\n```\n\n*`-rate-limit`*\n-----\noption to use to define max number of request can go out per second.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -rl 100\n```\n\n*`-rate-limit-minute`*\n-----\noption to use to define max number of request can go out per minute.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -rlm 500\n```\n\nHere is all long / short CLI options for rate limit control -\n\n```console\nkatana -h rate-limit\n\nFlags:\nRATE-LIMIT:\n   -c, -concurrency int          number of concurrent fetchers to use (default 10)\n   -p, -parallelism int          number of concurrent inputs to process (default 10)\n   -rd, -delay int               request delay between each request in seconds\n   -rl, -rate-limit int          maximum requests to send per second (default 150)\n   -rlm, -rate-limit-minute int  maximum number of requests to send per minute\n```\n\n## Output\n\nKatana support both file output in plain text format as well as JSON which includes additional information like, `source`, `tag`, and `attribute` name to co-related the discovered endpoint.\n\n*`-output`*\n---\n\nBy default, katana outputs the crawled endpoints in plain text format. The results can be written to a file by using the -output option.\n\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://example.com -no-scope -output example_endpoints.txt\n```\n\n*`-output-template`*\n---\n\nThe `-output-template` option allows you to customize the output format using template, providing flexibility in defining the output structure. This option replaces the deprecated `-field` flag for filtering output. Instead of relying on predefined fields, you can specify a custom template directly in the command line to control how the extracted data is presented.\n\nExample of using the `-output-template` option:\n\n```sh\nkatana -u https://example.com -output-template '{{email}} - {{url}}'\n```\n\nIn this example, `email` represents a [custom field](#custom-fields) that extracts and displays email addresses found within the source `url`.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If a specified field does not exist or does not contain a value, it will simply be omitted from the output.\n\nThis option can effectively structure the output in a way that best suits your use case, making data extraction more intuitive and customizable.\n\n*`-jsonl`*\n---\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://example.com -jsonl | jq .\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2023-03-20T16:23:58.027559+05:30\",\n  \"request\": {\n    \"method\": \"GET\",\n    \"endpoint\": \"https://example.com\",\n    \"raw\": \"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: example.com\\r\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 11_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.88 Safari/537.36\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\n  },\n  \"response\": {\n    \"status_code\": 200,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"accept_ranges\": \"bytes\",\n      \"expires\": \"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 10:53:58 GMT\",\n      \"last_modified\": \"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:18:26 GMT\",\n      \"content_type\": \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\",\n      \"server\": \"ECS (dcb/7EA3)\",\n      \"vary\": \"Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"etag\": \"\\\"3147526947\\\"\",\n      \"cache_control\": \"max-age=604800\",\n      \"x_cache\": \"HIT\",\n      \"date\": \"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 10:53:58 GMT\",\n      \"age\": \"331239\"\n    },\n    \"body\": \"<!doctype html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n    <title>Example Domain</title>\\n\\n    <meta charset=\\\"utf-8\\\" />\\n    <meta http-equiv=\\\"Content-type\\\" content=\\\"text/html; charset=utf-8\\\" />\\n    <meta name=\\\"viewport\\\" content=\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\\\" />\\n    <style type=\\\"text/css\\\">\\n    body {\\n        background-color: #f0f0f2;\\n        margin: 0;\\n        padding: 0;\\n        font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, \\\"Segoe UI\\\", \\\"Open Sans\\\", \\\"Helvetica Neue\\\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\\n        \\n    }\\n    div {\\n        width: 600px;\\n        margin: 5em auto;\\n        padding: 2em;\\n        background-color: #fdfdff;\\n        border-radius: 0.5em;\\n        box-shadow: 2px 3px 7px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.02);\\n    }\\n    a:link, a:visited {\\n        color: #38488f;\\n        text-decoration: none;\\n    }\\n    @media (max-width: 700px) {\\n        div {\\n            margin: 0 auto;\\n            width: auto;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    </style>    \\n</head>\\n\\n<body>\\n<div>\\n    <h1>Example Domain</h1>\\n    <p>This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents.

When this option is used, text files including the request and response will be written to the **katana_response** directory. If you would like to specify a custom directory, you can use the `-store-response-dir` option.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://example.com -no-scope -store-response\n```\n\n```bash\n$ cat katana_response/index.txt\n\nkatana_response/example.com/327c3fda87ce286848a574982ddd0b7c7487f816.txt https://example.com (200 OK)\nkatana_response/www.iana.org/bfc096e6dd93b993ca8918bf4c08fdc707a70723.txt http://www.iana.org/domains/reserved (200 OK)\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n*`-store-response` option is not supported in `-headless` mode.*\n\n*`-list-output-fields`*\n----\n\nThe `-list-output-fields` or `-lof` flag displays all available fields that can be used in JSONL output format. This is useful for understanding what data is available when using custom output templates or when excluding specific fields.\n\n```console\nkatana -lof\n```\n\n*`-exclude-output-fields`*\n----\n\nThe `-exclude-output-fields` or `-eof` flag allows you to exclude specific fields from the JSONL output. This is useful for reducing output size or focusing on specific data by removing unwanted fields.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://example.com -jsonl -eof raw,body\n```\n\nHere are additional CLI options related to output -\n\n```console\nkatana -h output\n\nOUTPUT:\n   -o, -output string                file to write output to\n   -sr, -store-response              store http requests/responses\n   -srd, -store-response-dir string  store http requests/responses to custom directory\n   -lof, -list-output-fields         list available fields for jsonl output format\n   -eof, -exclude-output-fields      exclude fields from jsonl output\n   -j, -json                         write output in JSONL(ines) format\n   -nc, -no-color                    disable output content coloring (ANSI escape codes)\n   -silent                           display output only\n   -v, -verbose                      display verbose output\n   -version                          display project version\n```\n\n## Katana as a library\n`katana` can be used as a library by creating an instance of the `Option` struct and populating it with the same options that would be specified via CLI. Using the options you can create `crawlerOptions` and so standard or hybrid `crawler`.\n`crawler.Crawl` method should be called to crawl the input.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"math\"\n\n\t\"github.com/projectdiscovery/gologger\"\n\t\"github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/pkg/engine/standard\"\n\t\"github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/pkg/output\"\n\t\"github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/pkg/types\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\toptions := &types.Options{\n\t\tMaxDepth:     3,             // Maximum depth to crawl\n\t\tFieldScope:   \"rdn\",         // Crawling Scope Field\n\t\tBodyReadSize: math.MaxInt,   // Maximum response size to read\n\t\tTimeout:      10,            // Timeout is the time to wait for request in seconds\n\t\tConcurrency:  10,            // Concurrency is the number of concurrent crawling goroutines\n\t\tParallelism:  10,            // Parallelism is the number of urls processing goroutines\n\t\tDelay:        0,             // Delay is the delay between each crawl requests in seconds\n\t\tRateLimit:    150,           // Maximum requests to send per second\n\t\tStrategy:     \"depth-first\", // Visit strategy (depth-first, breadth-first)\n\t\tOnResult: func(result output.Result) { // Callback function to execute for result\n\t\t\tgologger.Info().Msg(result.Request.URL)\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\tcrawlerOptions, err := types.NewCrawlerOptions(options)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tgologger.Fatal().Msg(err.Error())\n\t}\n\tdefer crawlerOptions.Close()\n\tcrawler, err := standard.New(crawlerOptions)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tgologger.Fatal().Msg(err.Error())\n\t}\n\tdefer crawler.Close()\n\tvar input = \"https://www.hackerone.com\"\n\terr = crawler.Crawl(input)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tgologger.Warning().Msgf(\"Could not crawl %s: %s\", input, err.Error())\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Reporting Issues & Feature Requests\n\nTo maintain issue tracking and improve triage efficiency:\n\n**All reports start as [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/discussions)**\n\n- **Bug Reports** → [Start a Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/discussions/new?category=q-a)\n- **Feature Requests** → [Start an Ideas Discussion](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/discussions/new?category=ideas)  \n- **Questions** → [Start a Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/discussions/new?category=q-a)\n\n**Why Discussions First?**\n- **Community can help** with quick questions and troubleshooting\n- **Better triage** - confirmed bugs/features become tracked issues  \n- **Cleaner issue tracker** - focus on actionable items only\n\nMaintainers will convert discussions to issues when appropriate after proper review.\n\n--------\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\nkatana is made with ❤️ by the [projectdiscovery](https://projectdiscovery.io) team and distributed under [MIT License](LICENSE.md).\n\n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/projectdiscovery\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-burp-plugin/main/static/join-discord.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Join Discord\"></a>\n\n</div>\n",

Mastra integrates with frontend and backend frameworks like React, Next.js, and Node, or you can deploy it anywhere as a standalone server. It's the easiest way to build, tune, and scale reliable AI products.\n\n## Why Mastra?\n\nPurpose-built for TypeScript and designed around established AI patterns, Mastra gives you everything you need to build great AI applications out-of-the-box.\n\nSome highlights include:\n\n- [**Model routing**](https://mastra.ai/models) - Connect to 40+ providers through one standard interface. Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more.\n\n- [**Agents**](https://mastra.ai/docs/agents/overview) - Build autonomous agents that use LLMs and tools to solve open-ended tasks. Agents reason about goals, decide which tools to use, and iterate internally until the model emits a final answer or an optional stopping condition is met.\n\n- [**Workflows**](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/overview) - When you need explicit control over execution, use Mastra's graph-based workflow engine to orchestrate complex multi-step processes. Mastra workflows use an intuitive syntax for control flow (`.then()`, `.branch()`, `.parallel()`).\n\n- [**Human-in-the-loop**](https://mastra.ai/docs/workflows/suspend-and-resume) - Suspend an agent or workflow and await user input or approval before resuming. Mastra uses [storage](https://mastra.ai/docs/server-db/storage) to remember execution state, so you can pause indefinitely and resume where you left off.\n\n- **Context management** - Give your agents the right context at the right time. Provide [conversation history](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/conversation-history), [retrieve](https://mastra.ai/docs/rag/overview) data from your sources (APIs, databases, files), and add human-like [working](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/working-memory) and [semantic](https://mastra.ai/docs/memory/semantic-recall) memory so your agents behave coherently.\n\n- **Integrations** - Bundle agents and workflows into existing React, Next.js, or Node.js apps, or ship them as standalone endpoints. When building UIs, integrate with agentic libraries like Vercel's AI SDK UI and CopilotKit to bring your AI assistant to life on the web.\n\n- [**MCP servers**](https://mastra.ai/docs/tools-mcp/mcp-overview) - Author Model Context Protocol servers, exposing agents, tools, and other structured resources via the MCP interface. These can then be accessed by any system or agent that supports the protocol.\n\n- **Production essentials** - Shipping reliable agents takes ongoing insight, evaluation, and iteration.

It is designed to be fast, reliable, portable, and easy to use. DuckDB provides a rich SQL dialect with support far beyond basic SQL. DuckDB supports arbitrary and nested correlated subqueries, window functions, collations, complex types (arrays, structs, maps), and [several extensions designed to make SQL easier to use](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/dialect/friendly_sql.html).\n\nDuckDB is available as a [standalone CLI application](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview) and has clients for [Python](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/python/overview), [R](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/r), [Java](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/java), [Wasm](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/wasm/overview), etc., with deep integrations with packages such as [pandas](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/python/sql_on_pandas) and [dplyr](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/r#duckplyr-dplyr-api).\n\nFor more information on using DuckDB, please refer to the [DuckDB documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/).\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you want to install DuckDB, please see [our installation page](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/) for instructions.\n\n## Data Import\n\nFor CSV files and Parquet files, data import is as simple as referencing the file in the FROM clause:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM 'myfile.csv';\nSELECT * FROM 'myfile.parquet';\n```\n\nRefer to our [Data Import](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/data/overview) section for more information.\n\n## SQL Reference\n\nThe documentation contains a [SQL introduction and reference](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/introduction).\n\n## Development\n\nFor development, DuckDB requires [CMake](https://cmake.org), Python 3 and a `C++11` compliant compiler. In the root directory, run `make` to compile the sources. For development, use `make debug` to build a non-optimized debug version. You should run `make unit` and `make allunit` to verify that your version works properly after making changes. To test performance, you can run `BUILD_BENCHMARK=1 BUILD_TPCH=1 make` and then perform several standard benchmarks from the root directory by executing `./build/release/benchmark/benchmark_runner`. The details of benchmarks are in our [Benchmark Guide](benchmark/README.md).\n\nPlease also refer to our [Build Guide](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/dev/building/overview) and [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Support\n\nSee the [Support Options](https://duckdblabs.com/support/) page and the dedicated [`endoflife.date`](https://endoflife.date/duckdb) page.\n",

However, it also uses a set of native OS-specific components for desktop UI, high performance database drivers and networking.\n- Basic frameworks:\n  - [OSGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) platform for plugins and dependency management. Community version consists of 130+ plugins.\n  - [Eclipse RCP](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.ui/blob/master/docs/Rich_Client_Platform.md) platform for rich user interface build.\n  - [JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity) for basic database connectivity API.\n  - [JSQLParser](https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser) and [Antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) for SQL grammar and semantic parser.\n- For networking and additional functionality we use wide range of open source libraries such as [SSHJ](https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj), [Apache POI](https://github.com/apache/poi), [JFreeChart](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart), [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts), [Apache JEXL](https://github.com/apache/commons-jexl) etc.\n- We separate model plugins from desktop UI plugins. This allows us to use the same set of \"back-end\" plugins in both DBeaver and [CloudBeaver](https://github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver).\n- Dependencies: being an OSGI application we use P2 repositories for third party dependencies. For additional Maven dependencies we use our own [DBeaver P2 repo](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver-deps-ce).\n\n## Supported databases\n\n### Community version\n\nOut of the box DBeaver supports following database drivers: \nMySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, DB2, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Sybase, Apache Hive, Drill, Presto, Trino, Phoenix, Exasol, Informix, Teradata, Vertica, Netezza, Firebird, Derby, H2, H2GIS, WMI, Snowflake, Greenplum, Redshift, Athena, SAP HANA, MaxDB, NuoDB, MS Access, SQLite, CSV, DBF, Firebird, TimescaleDB, Yellowbrick, CockroachDB, OrientDB, MonetDB, Google BigQuery, Google Spanner, Apache Hive/Impala/Spark, Apache Ignite, MapD, Azure SQL, CrateDB, Elasticsearch, Ocient, Ingres, OmniSci, Yugabyte, IRIS, Data Virtuality, Denodo, Virtuoso, Machbase, DuckDB, Babelfish, OceanBase, Salesforce, EnterpriseDB, Apache Druid, Apache Kylin, Databricks, OpenSearch, TiDB, TDEngine, Materialize, JDBCX, Dameng, Altibase, StarRocks, CUBRID, GaussDB, DolphinDB, LibSQL, GBase 8s, Databend, Cloudberry, Teiid, Kingbase.\n\n### PRO versions\n\n<a href=\"https://dbeaver.com/download/\">Commercial versions</a> extends functionality of many popular drivers and also support non-JDBC datasources such as:\nODBC, MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, CouchDB, Redis, InfluxDB, Firestore, BigTable, DynamoDB, Kafka KSQL, Neo4j, AWS Neptune, AWS Timestream, Azure CosmosDB, Yugabyte, Salesforce, etc.  \nAlso, we support flat files as databases: CSV, XLSX, Json, XML, Parquet.  \nYou can find the list of all databases supported in commercial versions <a href=\"https://dbeaver.com/databases/\">here</a>.\n\n## Feedback\n\n- For bug reports and feature requests - please <a href=\"https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues\">create a ticket</a>.\n- To promote <a href=\"https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3A%22wait+for+votes%22\">a ticket</a> to a higher priority - please vote for it with 👍 under the ticket description.\n- If you have any questions, ideas, etc - please <a href=\"https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/discussions\">start a discussion</a>.\n- Pull requests are welcome.

SurrealDB combines document, graph, relational, time-series, geospatial and key-value data types with powerful search and retrieval functionalities (full-text, vector, hybrid) and real-time and event-driven capabilities, enabling developers to build powerful applications faster and more efficiently. SurrealDB can also be used as a backend-as-a-service given its support for end user authentication. Given that it’s a single Rust binary, SurrealDB can run embedded (in‐app), in the browser (via WebAssembly), in the edge, self-hosted as single backend node, or in a distributed cluster in the cloud.\n\nSurrealDB is used for data-intensive systems such as applications requiring multiple data types, data layer for AI agents, knowledge graphs, real-time apps (e.g. recommendation engines, fraud detection systems) and embedded/edge systems. With SurrealDB, you can simplify your database and API infrastructure, reduce development time, and build secure, performant apps quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n**Key features of SurrealDB include:**\n\n- **Reduces development time**: SurrealDB simplifies your database and API stack by removing the need for most server-side components, allowing you to build secure, performant apps faster and cheaper.\n- **Real-time collaborative API backend service:** SurrealDB functions as both a database and an API backend service, enabling real-time collaboration.\n- **Support for multiple querying languages:** SurrealDB supports SQL querying from client devices, GraphQL, ACID transactions, WebSocket connections, structured and unstructured data, graph querying, full-text and vector indexing, and geospatial querying.\n- **Granular access control**: SurrealDB provides row-level permissions-based access control, giving you the ability to manage data access with precision.\n\nView the [features](https://surrealdb.com/features), the latest [releases](https://surrealdb.com/releases), and [documentation](https://surrealdb.com/docs).\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"./img/interface.png\" alt=\"Surrealist\">\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"./img/contents.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Contents</h2>\n\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Getting started](#getting-started)\n\t- [Server side code](#server-side-code)\n\t- [Client side apps](#client-side-apps)\n- [SurrealDB Cloud](#surrealdb-cloud)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n\t- [Install on macOS](#install-on-macos)\n\t- [Install on Linux](#install-on-linux)\n\t- [Install on Windows](#install-on-windows)\n\t- [Run using Docker](#run-using-docker)\n- [Quick look](#quick-look)\n- [Why SurrealDB](#why-surrealdb)\n\t- [Database, API, and permissions](#database-api-and-permissions)\n\t- [Tables, documents, and graph](#tables-documents-and-graph)\n\t- [Advanced inter-document relations](#advanced-inter-document-relations-and-analysis-no-joins-no-pain)\n\t- [Simple schema definition](#simple-schema-definition-for-frontend-and-backend-development)\n\t- [Connect directly from web-browsers](#connect-and-query-directly-from-web-browsers-and-client-devices)\n\t- [Multiple different query methods](#query-the-database-with-the-tools-you-want)\n\t- [Realtime live queries and data changes](#realtime-live-queries-and-data-changes-direct-to-application)\n\t- [Scale effortlessly for high-availability](#scale-effortlessly-to-hundreds-of-nodes-for-high-availability-and-scalability)\n\t- [Extend your database with JavaScript](#extend-your-database-with-javascript-functions)\n\t- [Designed to be embedded or in the cloud](#designed-to-be-embedded-or-to-run-distributed-in-the-cloud)\n- [Community](#community)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Security](#security)\n- [License](#license)\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"./img/features.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Features</h2>\n\n- [x] Database server, or embedded library\n- [x] Multi-row, multi-table ACID transactions\n- [x] Single-node, or highly-scalable distributed mode\n- [x] Record links and directed typed graph connections\n- [x] Store structured and unstructured data\n- [x] Incrementally computed views for pre-computed advanced analytics\n- [x] Realtime-API layer, and security permissions built in\n- [x] Store and model data in any way with tables, documents, and graph\n- [x] Simple schema definition for frontend and backend development\n- [x] Connect and query directly from web-browsers and client devices\n- [x] Use embedded JavaScript functions for custom advanced functionality\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"./img/documentation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation</h2>\n\nFor guidance on installation, development, deployment, and administration, take a look at the following resources:\n\n- Documentation: https://surrealdb.com/docs\n- SurrealDB University: https://surrealdb.com/learn\n- Aeon's Surreal Renaissance (interactive book): https://surrealdb.com/learn/book\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"./img/gettingstarted.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting started</h2>\n\nGetting started with SurrealDB is as easy as starting up the SurrealDB database server, choosing your platform, and integrating its SDK into your code.

Advanced table-based and row-based customisable access permissions allow for granular data access patterns for different types of users. There's no need for custom backend code and security rules with complicated database development.\n\n### Tables, documents, and graph\n\nAs a multi-model database, SurrealDB enables developers to use multiple techniques to store and model data, without having to choose a method in advance. With the use of tables, SurrealDB has similarities with relational databases, but with the added functionality and flexibility of advanced nested fields and arrays. Inter-document record links allow for simple to understand and highly-performant related queries without the use of JOINs, eliminating the N+1 query problem.\n\n<p>\n\t<img width=\"49%\" src=\"./img/illustrations/graph-database.jpg\" />\n\t<img width=\"49%\" src=\"./img/illustrations/schema-direct-to-client.jpg\" />\n</p>\n\n### Advanced inter-document relations and analysis. No JOINs. No pain.\n\nWith full graph database functionality SurrealDB enables more advanced querying and analysis. Records (or vertices) can be connected to one another with edges, each with its own record properties and metadata. Simple extensions to traditional SQL queries allow for multi-table, multi-depth document retrieval, efficiently in the database, without the use of complicated JOINs and without bringing the data down to the client.\n\n### Simple schema definition for frontend and backend development\n\nWith SurrealDB, specify your database and API schema in one place, and define column rules and constraints just once. Once a schema is defined, database access is automatically granted to the relevant users. No more custom API code, and no more GraphQL integration. Simple, flexible, and ready for production in minutes not months.\n\n<p>\n\t<img width=\"49%\" src=\"./img/illustrations/browser-sync.jpg\" />\n\t<img width=\"49%\" src=\"./img/illustrations/multiple-integrations.jpg\" />\n</p>\n\n### Connect and query directly from web-browsers and client devices\n\nConnect directly to SurrealDB from any end-user client device. Run SurrealQL queries directly within web-browsers, ensuring that users can only view or modify the data that they are allowed to access. Highly-performant WebSocket connections allow for efficient bi-directional queries, responses and notifications.\n\n### Query the database with the tools you want\n\nYour data, your choice. SurrealDB is designed to be flexible to use, with support for SurrealQL, GraphQL (coming soon), CRUD support over REST, and JSON-RPC querying and modification over WebSockets. With direct-to-client connection with in-built permissions, SurrealDB speeds up the development process, and fits in seamlessly into any tech stack.\n\n<p>\n\t<img width=\"49%\" src=\"./img/illustrations/realtime-live-queries.jpg\" />\n\t<img width=\"49%\" src=\"./img/illustrations/scale-up.jpg\" />\n</p>\n\n### Realtime live queries and data changes direct to application\n\nSurrealDB keeps every client device in-sync with data modifications pushed in realtime to the clients, applications, end-user devices, and server-side libraries. Live SQL queries allow for advanced filtering of the changes to which a client subscribes, and efficient data formats, including DIFFing and PATCHing enable highly-performant web-based data syncing.\n\n### Scale effortlessly to hundreds of nodes for high-availability and scalability\n\nSurrealDB can be run as a single in-memory node, or as part of a distributed cluster - offering highly-available and highly-scalable system characteristics. Designed from the ground up to run in a distributed environment, SurrealDB makes use of special techniques when handling multi-table transactions, and document record IDs - with no use of table or row locks.\n\n<p>\n\t<img width=\"49%\" src=\"./img/illustrations/database-plugins.jpg\" />\n\t<img width=\"49%\" src=\"./img/illustrations/cloud-or-embedded.jpg\" />\n</p>\n\n### Extend your database with JavaScript functions\n\nEmbedded JavaScript functions allow for advanced, custom functionality, with computation logic being moved to the data layer. This improves upon the traditional approach of moving data to the client devices before applying any computation logic, ensuring that only the necessary data is transferred remotely. These advanced JavaScript functions, with support for the ES2020 standard, allow any developer to analyse the data in ever more simple-yet-advanced ways.\n\n### Designed to be embedded or to run distributed in the cloud\n\nBuilt entirely in Rust as a single library, SurrealDB is designed to be used as both an embedded database library with advanced querying functionality, and as a database server which can operate in a distributed cluster. With low memory usage and cpu requirements, the system requirements have been specifically thought through for running in all types of environment.\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"./img/community.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Community</h2>\n\nJoin our growing community around the world, for help, ideas, and discussions regarding SurrealDB.\n\n- View our official [Blog](https://surrealdb.com/blog)\n- Chat live with us on [Discord](https://surrealdb.com/discord)\n- Follow us on [X](https://x.com/surrealdb)\n- Connect with us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/surrealdb/)\n- Join the discussion on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/surrealdb/)\n- Visit us on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@surrealdb)\n- Join our [Dev community](https://dev.to/surrealdb)\n- Questions tagged #surrealdb on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/surrealdb)\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"./img/contributing.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributing</h2>\n\nWe would &nbsp;<img width=\"15\" src=\"./img/love.svg\">&nbsp; for you to get involved with SurrealDB development!

      "readme": "About\n----- \n\n**drawio-desktop** is a diagramming desktop app based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) that wraps the [core draw.io editor](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).\n\nDownload built binaries from the [releases section](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases).\n\n**Can I use this app for free?** Yes, under the apache 2.0 license. If you don't change the code and accept it is provided \"as-is\", you can use it for any purpose.\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\ndraw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.\n\nNo diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. There is a Content Security Policy in place on the web part of the interface to ensure external transmission cannot happen, even by accident.\n\nSecurity and isolating the app are the primarily objectives of draw.io desktop. If you ask for anything that involves external connections enabled in the app by default, the answer will be no.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nSupport is provided on a reasonable business constraints basis, but without anything contractually binding. All support is provided via this repo. There is no private ticketing support for non-paying users.\n\nPurchasing draw.io for Confluence or Jira does not entitle you to commercial support for draw.io desktop.\n\nDeveloping\n----------\n\n**draw.io** is a git submodule of **drawio-desktop**. To get both you need to clone recursively:\n\n`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop.git`\n\nTo run this:\n1. `npm install` (in the root directory of this repo)\n2. [internal use only] export DRAWIO_ENV=dev if you want to develop/debug in dev mode.\n3. `npm start` _in the root directory of this repo_ runs the app. For debugging, use `npm start --enable-logging`.\n\nNote: If a symlink is used to refer to drawio repo (instead of the submodule), then symlink the `node_modules` directory inside `drawio/src/main/webapp` also.\n\nTo release:\n1. Update the draw.io sub-module and push the change. Add version tag before pushing to origin.\n2. Wait for the builds to complete (https://travis-ci.org/jgraph/drawio-desktop and https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidjgraph/drawio-desktop)\n3. Go to https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases, edit the preview release.\n4. Download the windows exe and windows portable, sign them using `signtool sign /a /tr http://rfc3161timestamp.globalsign.com/advanced /td SHA256 c:/path/to/your/file.exe`\n5. Re-upload signed file as `draw.io-windows-installer-x.y.z.exe` and `draw.io-windows-no-installer-x.y.z.exe`\n6. Add release notes\n7. Publish release\n\n*Note*: In Windows release, when using both x64 and is32 as arch, the result is one big file with both archs. This is why we split them.\n\nLocal Storage and Session Storage is stored in the AppData folder:\n\n- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/draw.io`\n- Windows: `C:\\Users\\<USER-NAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\draw.io\\`\n\nNot open-contribution\n---------------------\n\ndraw.io is closed to contributions (unless a maintainer permits it, which is extremely rare).\n\nThe level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes \ncan break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required \nis far more than it first seems. If we were to receive a PR, we'd have \nto basically throw it away and write it how we want it to be implemented.\n\nWe are grateful for community involvement, bug reports, & feature requests. We do\nnot wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, we've\nmade the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for \nthe long term viability of the project.\n",

      "readme": "# CyberChef\n\n[![](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/workflows/Master%20Build,%20Test%20&%20Deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Master+Build%2C+Test+%26+Deploy%22)\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cyberchef.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cyberchef)\n[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/blob/master/LICENSE)\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/gchq/CyberChef.svg)](https://gitter.im/gchq/CyberChef?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n\n\n#### *The Cyber Swiss Army Knife*\n\nCyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of \"cyber\" operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.\n\nThe tool is designed to enable both technical and non-technical analysts to manipulate data in complex ways without having to deal with complex tools or algorithms. It was conceived, designed, built and incrementally improved by an analyst in their 10% innovation time over several years.\n\n## Live demo\n\nCyberChef is still under active development. As a result, it shouldn't be considered a finished product. There is still testing and bug fixing to do, new features to be added and additional documentation to write. Please contribute!\n\nCryptographic operations in CyberChef should not be relied upon to provide security in any situation. No guarantee is offered for their correctness.\n\n[A live demo can be found here][1] - have fun!\n\n## Running Locally with Docker\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n- [Docker](hhttps://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)\n  - Docker Desktop must be open and running on your machine\n\n\n#### Option 1: Build the Docker Image Yourself\n\n1. Build the docker image\n```bash\ndocker build --tag cyberchef --ulimit nofile=10000 .\n```\n2. Run the docker container\n```bash\ndocker run -it -p 8080:80 cyberchef\n```\n3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser\n\n#### Option 2: Use the pre-built Docker Image\n\nIf you prefer to skip the build process, you can use the pre-built image\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/gchq/cyberchef:latest\n```\n\nJust like before, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.\n\nThis image is built and published through our [GitHub Workflows](.github/workflows/releases.yml)\n\n## How it works\n\nThere are four main areas in CyberChef:\n\n 1. The **input** box in the top right, where you can paste, type or drag the text or file you want to operate on.\n 2. The **output** box in the bottom right, where the outcome of your processing will be displayed.\n 3. The **operations** list on the far left, where you can find all the operations that CyberChef is capable of in categorised lists, or by searching.\n 4. The **recipe** area in the middle, where you can drag the operations that you want to use and specify arguments and options.\n\nYou can use as many operations as you like in simple or complex ways. Some examples are as follows:\n\n - [Decode a Base64-encoded string][2]\n - [Convert a date and time to a different time zone][3]\n - [Parse a Teredo IPv6 address][4]\n - [Convert data from a hexdump, then decompress][5]\n - [Decrypt and disassemble shellcode][6]\n - [Display multiple timestamps as full dates][7]\n - [Carry out different operations on data of different types][8]\n - [Use parts of the input as arguments to operations][9]\n - [Perform AES decryption, extracting the IV from the beginning of the cipher stream][10]\n - [Automagically detect several layers of nested encoding][12]\n\n\n## Features\n\n - Drag and drop\n     - Operations can be dragged in and out of the recipe list, or reorganised.\n     - Files up to 2GB can be dragged over the input box to load them directly into the browser.\n - Auto Bake\n     - Whenever you modify the input or the recipe, CyberChef will automatically \"bake\" for you and produce the output immediately.\n     - This can be turned off and operated manually if it is affecting performance (if the input is very large, for instance).\n - Automated encoding detection\n     - CyberChef uses [a number of techniques](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/wiki/Automatic-detection-of-encoded-data-using-CyberChef-Magic) to attempt to automatically detect which encodings your data is under. If it finds a suitable operation that make sense of your data, it displays the 'magic' icon in the Output field which you can click to decode your data.\n - Breakpoints\n     - You can set breakpoints on any operation in your recipe to pause execution before running it.\n     - You can also step through the recipe one operation at a time to see what the data looks like at each stage.\n - Save and load recipes\n     - If you come up with an awesome recipe that you know you’ll want to use again, just click \"Save recipe\" and add it to your local storage. It'll be waiting for you next time you visit CyberChef.\n     - You can also copy the URL, which includes your recipe and input, to easily share it with others.\n - Search\n     - If you know the name of the operation you want or a word associated with it, start typing it into the search field and any matching operations will immediately be shown.\n - Highlighting\n     - When you highlight text in the input or output, the offset and length values will be displayed and, if possible, the corresponding data will be highlighted in the output or input respectively (example: [highlight the word 'question' in the input to see where it appears in the output][11]).\n - Save to file and load from file\n     - You can save the output to a file at any time or load a file by dragging and dropping it into the input field. Files up to around 2GB are supported (depending on your browser), however, some operations may take a very long time to run over this much data.\n - CyberChef is entirely client-side\n     - It should be noted that none of your recipe configuration or input (either text or files) is ever sent to the CyberChef web server - all processing is carried out within your browser, on your own computer.\n     - Due to this feature, CyberChef can be downloaded and run locally. You can use the link in the top left corner of the app to download a full copy of CyberChef and drop it into a virtual machine, share it with other people, or host it in a closed network.\n\n\n## Deep linking\n\nBy manipulating CyberChef's URL hash, you can change the initial settings with which the page opens.\nThe format is `https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Operation()&input=...`\n\nSupported arguments are `recipe`, `input` (encoded in Base64), and `theme`.\n\n\n## Browser support\n\nCyberChef is built to support\n\n - Google Chrome 50+\n - Mozilla Firefox 38+\n\n\n## Node.js support\n\nCyberChef is built to fully support Node.js `v16`. For more information, see the [\"Node API\" wiki page](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/wiki/Node-API)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributing a new operation to CyberChef is super easy! The quickstart script will walk you through the process.

For scenarios requiring more complex process control, Agent Framework offers built-in workflows like `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `RoutingAgent`, `LoopAgent` and `SupervisorAgent`.\n\n**Spring AI Alibaba Graph** serves as the underlying runtime of the Agent Framework, providing essential capabilities such as persistence, workflow orchestration, and streaming required for long-running stateful agents. Compared to the Agent Framework, users can build more flexible multi-agent workflows based on the Graph API.\n\n## Core Features\n\n* **[Multi-Agent Orchestration](https://java2ai.com/docs/frameworks/agent-framework/advanced/multi-agent)**: Compose multiple agents with built-in patterns including `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LlmRoutingAgent`, and `LoopAgent` for complex task execution.\n\n* **[Context Engineering](https://java2ai.com/docs/frameworks/agent-framework/tutorials/hooks)**: Built-in best practices for context engineering policies to improve agent reliability and performance, including human-in-the-loop, context compaction, context editing, model & tool call limit, tool retry, planning, dynamic tool selection.\n\n* **[Graph-based Workflow](https://java2ai.com/docs/frameworks/graph-core/quick-start)**: Graph based workflow runtime and api for conditional routing, nested graphs, parallel execution, and state management. Export workflows to PlantUML and Mermaid formats.\n\n* **[A2A Support](https://java2ai.com/docs/frameworks/agent-framework/advanced/a2a)**: Agent-to-Agent communication support with Nacos integration, enabling distributed agent coordination and collaboration across services.\n\n* **[Rich Model, Tool and MCP Support](https://java2ai.com/integration/chatmodels/dashScope)**: Leveraging core concepts of Spring AI, supports multiple LLM providers (DashScope, OpenAI, etc.), tool calling, and Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\n* **[One-stop Agent Platform](https://java2ai.com/ecosystem/admin/quick-start)**: Build agent in a visualized way, deploy agent without code or export as a standalone java project.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"./docs/imgs/saa-admin.png\" alt=\"architecture\" style=\"max-width: 740px; height: auto\" />\n</p>\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Requires JDK 17+.\n* Choose your LLM provider and get the API-KEY.\n\n### Quickly Run a ChatBot\n\nThere's a ChatBot example provided by the community at [examples/chatbot](https://github.com/alibaba/spring-ai-alibaba/tree/main/examples/chatbot).\n\n1. Download the code.\n\n\t```shell\n\tgit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/alibaba/spring-ai-alibaba.git\n\tcd spring-ai-alibaba/examples/chatbot\n\t```\n\n2. Start the ChatBot.\n\n\tBefore starting, set API-KEY first (visit <a href=\"https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/?apiKey=1&tab=api#/api\" target=\"_blank\">Aliyun Bailian</a> to get API-KEY):\n\t```shell\n\t# this example uses 'spring-ai-alibaba-starter-dashscope', visit https://java2ai.com to learn how to use OpenAI/DeepSeek.\n\texport AI_DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your-api-key\n\t```\n\t\n\t```shell\n\tmvn spring-boot:run\n\t```\n\n3. Chat with ChatBot.\n\n\tOpen the browser and visit [http://localhost:8080/chatui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/chatui/index.html) to chat with the ChatBot.\n\t\n<p align=\"center\">\n\t<img src=\"./docs/imgs/chatbot-chat-ui.gif\" alt=\"chatbot-ui\" style=\"max-width: 740px; height: auto\" />\n</p>\n\n## Chatbot Code Explained\n\n1. Add dependencies\n\n\t```xml\n\t<dependencies>\n\t  <dependency>\n\t    <groupId>com.alibaba.cloud.ai</groupId>\n\t    <artifactId>spring-ai-alibaba-agent-framework</artifactId>\n\t    <version>1.1.0.0</version>\n\t  </dependency>\n\t  <!-- Assume you are going to use DashScope Model. Refer to docs for how to choose model.-->\n\t  <dependency>\n\t    <groupId>com.alibaba.cloud.ai</groupId>\n\t    <artifactId>spring-ai-alibaba-starter-dashscope</artifactId>\n\t    <version>1.1.0.0</version>\n\t  </dependency>\n\t</dependencies>\n\t```\n\n2.

[webhooks](https://docs.livekit.io/home/server/webhooks/). In addition, the Go SDK includes client capabilities,\nenabling you to build automations that behave like end-users.\n\n| Language                | Repo                                                                                    | Docs                                                        |\n| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Go                      | [server-sdk-go](https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-go)                               | [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/livekit/server-sdk-go) |\n| JavaScript (TypeScript) | [server-sdk-js](https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-js)                               | [docs](https://docs.livekit.io/server-sdk-js/)              |\n| Ruby                    | [server-sdk-ruby](https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-ruby)                           |                                                             |\n| Java (Kotlin)           | [server-sdk-kotlin](https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-kotlin)                       |                                                             |\n| Python (community)      | [python-sdks](https://github.com/livekit/python-sdks)                                   |                                                             |\n| PHP (community)         | [agence104/livekit-server-sdk-php](https://github.com/agence104/livekit-server-sdk-php) |                                                             |\n\n### Tools\n\n-   [CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) - command line interface & load tester\n-   [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/livekit/livekit-server)\n-   [Helm charts](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-helm)\n\n## Install\n\n> [!TIP]\n> We recommend installing [LiveKit CLI](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli) along with the server. It lets you access\n> server APIs, create tokens, and generate test traffic.\n\nThe following will install LiveKit's media server:\n\n### MacOS\n\n```shell\nbrew install livekit\n```\n\n### Linux\n\n```shell\ncurl -sSL https://get.livekit.io | bash\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nDownload the [latest release here](https://github.com/livekit/livekit/releases/latest)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Starting LiveKit\n\nStart LiveKit in development mode by running `livekit-server --dev`. It'll use a placeholder API key/secret pair.\n\n```\nAPI Key: devkey\nAPI Secret: secret\n```\n\nTo customize your setup for production, refer to our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/)\n\n### Creating access token\n\nA user connecting to a LiveKit room requires an [access token](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/authentication/#creating-a-token). Access\ntokens (JWT) encode the user's identity and the room permissions they've been granted. You can generate a token with our\nCLI:\n\n```shell\nlk token create \\\n    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \\\n    --join --room my-first-room --identity user1 \\\n    --valid-for 24h\n```\n\n### Test with example app\n\nHead over to our [example app](https://example.livekit.io) and enter a generated token to connect to your LiveKit\nserver. This app is built with our [React SDK](https://github.com/livekit/livekit-react).\n\nOnce connected, your video and audio are now being published to your new LiveKit instance!\n\n### Simulating a test publisher\n\n```shell\nlk room join \\\n    --url ws://localhost:7880 \\\n    --api-key devkey --api-secret secret \\\n    --identity bot-user1 \\\n    --publish-demo \\\n    my-first-room\n```\n\nThis command publishes a looped demo video to a room. Due to how the video clip was encoded (keyframes every 3s),\nthere's a slight delay before the browser has sufficient data to begin rendering frames. This is an artifact of the\nsimulation.\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Use LiveKit Cloud\n\nLiveKit Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to run LiveKit. Every project gets free monthly bandwidth and\ntranscoding credits.\n\nSign up for [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/).\n\n### Self-host\n\nRead our [deployment docs](https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/) for more information.\n\n## Building from source\n\nPre-requisites:\n\n-   Go 1.23+ is installed\n-   GOPATH/bin is in your PATH\n\nThen run\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/livekit/livekit\ncd livekit\n./bootstrap.sh\nmage\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions toward improving LiveKit! Please join us\n[on Slack](http://livekit.io/join-slack) to discuss your ideas and/or PRs.\n\n## License\n\nLiveKit server is licensed under Apache License v2.0.\n\n<!--BEGIN_REPO_NAV-->\n<br/><table>\n<thead><tr><th colspan=\"2\">LiveKit Ecosystem</th></tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>LiveKit SDKs</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-js\">Browser</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-swift\">iOS/macOS/visionOS</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-android\">Android</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-flutter\">Flutter</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-react-native\">React Native</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/rust-sdks\">Rust</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/node-sdks\">Node.js</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/python-sdks\">Python</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity\">Unity</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity-web\">Unity (WebGL)</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-esp32\">ESP32</a></td></tr><tr></tr>\n<tr><td>Server APIs</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/node-sdks\">Node.js</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-go\">Golang</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-ruby\">Ruby</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/server-sdk-kotlin\">Java/Kotlin</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/python-sdks\">Python</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/rust-sdks\">Rust</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/agence104/livekit-server-sdk-php\">PHP (community)</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/pabloFuente/livekit-server-sdk-dotnet\">.NET (community)</a></td></tr><tr></tr>\n<tr><td>UI Components</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/components-js\">React</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/components-android\">Android Compose</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/components-swift\">SwiftUI</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/components-flutter\">Flutter</a></td></tr><tr></tr>\n<tr><td>Agents Frameworks</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/agents\">Python</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/agents-js\">Node.js</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/agent-playground\">Playground</a></td></tr><tr></tr>\n<tr><td>Services</td><td><b>LiveKit server</b> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/egress\">Egress</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/ingress\">Ingress</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/sip\">SIP</a></td></tr><tr></tr>\n<tr><td>Resources</td><td><a href=\"https://docs.livekit.io\">Docs</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit-examples\">Example apps</a> · <a href=\"https://livekit.io/cloud\">Cloud</a> · <a href=\"https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/deployment\">Self-hosting</a> · <a href=\"https://github.com/livekit/livekit-cli\">CLI</a></td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!--END_REPO_NAV-->\n",

Here's why people choose Redis for:\n\n- **Performance:** Because Redis keeps data primarily in memory and uses efficient data structures, it achieves extremely low latency (often sub-millisecond) for both read and write operations. This makes it ideal for applications demanding real-time responsiveness.\n- **Flexibility:** Redis isn't just a key-value store, it provides native support for a wide range of data structures and capabilities listed in [What is Redis?](#what-is-redis)\n- **Extensibility:** Redis is not limited to the built-in data structures, it has a [modules API](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/reference/modules/) that makes it possible to extend Redis functionality and rapidly implement new Redis commands\n- **Simplicity:** Redis has a simple, text-based protocol and [well-documented command set](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/)\n- **Ubiquity:** Redis is battle tested in production workloads at a massive scale. There is a good chance you indirectly interact with Redis several times daily\n- **Versatility**: Redis is the de facto standard for use cases such as:\n  - **Caching:** quickly access frequently used data without needing to query your primary database\n  - **Session management:** read and write user session data without hurting user experience or slowing down every API call\n  - **Querying, sorting, and analytics:** perform deduplication, full text search, and secondary indexing on in-memory data as fast as possible\n  - **Messaging and interservice communication:** job queues, message brokering, pub/sub, and streams for communicating between services\n  - **Vector operations:** Long-term and short-term LLM memory, RAG content retrieval, semantic caching, semantic routing, and vector similarity search\n\nIn summary, Redis provides a powerful, fast, and flexible toolkit for solving a wide variety of data management challenges. If you want to know more, here is a list of starting points:\n\n- [**Introduction to Redis data types**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/)\n- [**The full list of Redis commands**](https://redis.io/commands/)\n- [**Redis for AI**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/ai/)\n- [**Redis documentation**](https://redis.io/documentation/)\n\n## What is Redis Open Source?\n\nRedis Community Edition (Redis CE) was renamed Redis Open Source with the v8.0 release.\n\nRedis Ltd. also offers [Redis Software](https://redis.io/enterprise/), a self-managed software with additional compliance, reliability, and resiliency for enterprise scaling,\nand [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/cloud/), a fully managed service integrated with Google Cloud, Azure, and AWS for production-ready apps.\n\nRead more about the differences between Redis Open Source and Redis [here](https://redis.io/technology/advantages/).\n\n## Getting started\n\nIf you want to get up and running with Redis quickly without needing to build from source, use one of the following methods:\n\n- [**Redis Cloud**](https://cloud.redis.io/)\n- [**Official Redis Docker images (Alpine/Debian)**](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)\n  ```sh\n  docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:latest\n  ```\n- **Redis binary distributions**\n  - [**Snap**](https://github.com/redis/redis-snap)\n  - [**Homebrew**](https://github.com/redis/homebrew-redis)\n  - [**RPM**](https://github.com/redis/redis-rpm)\n  - [**Debian**](https://github.com/redis/redis-debian)\n- [**Redis quick start guides**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/get-started/)\n\nIf you prefer to [build Redis from source](#build-redis-from-source) - see instructions below.\n\n### Redis starter projects\n\nTo get started as quickly as possible in your language of choice, use one of the following starter projects:\n\n- [**Python (redis-py)**](https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-starter-python)\n- [**C#/.NET (NRedisStack/StackExchange.Redis)**](https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-starter-csharp)\n- [**Go (go-redis)**](https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-starter-go)\n- [**JavaScript (node-redis)**](https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-starter-js)\n- [**Java/Spring (Jedis)**](https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-starter-java)\n\n### Using Redis with client libraries\n\nTo connect your application to Redis, you will need a client library. Redis has documented client libraries in most popular languages, with community-supported client libraries in additional languages.\n\n- [**Python (redis-py)**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/redis-py/)\n- [**Python (RedisVL)**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/integrate/redisvl/)\n- [**C#/.NET (NRedisStack/StackExchange.Redis)**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/dotnet/)\n- [**JavaScript (node-redis)**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/nodejs/)\n- [**Java (Jedis)**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/jedis/)\n- [**Java (Lettuce)**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/lettuce/)\n- [**Go (go-redis)**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/go/)\n- [**PHP (Predis)**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/php/)\n- [**C (hiredis)**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/hiredis/)\n- [**Full list of client libraries**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/)\n\n### Using Redis with redis-cli\n\n[`redis-cli`](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/tools/cli/) is Redis' command line interface. It is available as part of all the binary distributions and when you build Redis from source.\n\nYou can start a redis-server instance, and then, in another terminal try the following:\n\n```sh\ncd src\n./redis-cli\n```\n\n```text\nredis> ping\nPONG\nredis> set foo bar\nOK\nredis> get foo\n\"bar\"\nredis> incr mycounter\n(integer) 1\nredis> incr mycounter\n(integer) 2\nredis>\n```\n\n### Using Redis with Redis Insight\n\nFor a more visual and user-friendly experience, use [Redis Insight](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/tools/insight/) - a tool that lets you explore data, design, develop, and optimize your applications while also serving as a platform for Redis education and onboarding. Redis Insight integrates [Redis Copilot](https://redis.io/chat), a natural language AI assistant that improves the experience when working with data and commands.\n\n- [**Redis Insight documentation**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/tools/insight/)\n- [**Redis Insight GitHub repository**](https://github.com/RedisInsight/RedisInsight)\n\n## Redis data types, processing engines, and capabilities\n\nRedis provides a variety of data types, processing engines, and capabilities to support a wide range of use cases:\n\n**Important:** Features marked with an asterisk (\\*) require Redis to be compiled with the `BUILD_WITH_MODULES=yes` flag when [building Redis from source](#build-redis-from-source)\n\n- [**String:**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/strings) Sequences of bytes, including text, serialized objects, and binary arrays used for caching, counters, and bitwise operations.\n- [**JSON:**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/json/) Nested JSON documents that are indexed and searchable using JSONPath expressions and with [Redis Query Engine](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/search-and-query/)\n- [**Hash:**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/hashes/) Field-value maps used to represent basic objects and store groupings of key-value pairs with support for [hash field expiration (TTL)](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/hashes/#field-expiration)\n- [**Redis Query Engine:**](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/interact/search-and-query/) Use Redis as a document database, a vector database, a secondary index, and a search engine.

You need to use the following flag in the make command:\n\n```sh\nmake BUILD_WITH_MODULES=yes\n```\n\nNote: `BUILD_WITH_MODULES=yes` is not supported on 32 bit systems.\n\nTo build Redis with just the core data structures, use:\n\n```sh\nmake\n```\n\nTo build with TLS support, you need OpenSSL development libraries (e.g. libssl-dev on Debian/Ubuntu) and the following flag in the make command:\n\n```sh\nmake BUILD_TLS=yes\n```\n\nTo build with systemd support, you need systemd development libraries (such as libsystemd-dev on Debian/Ubuntu or systemd-devel on CentOS), and the following flag:\n\n```sh\nmake USE_SYSTEMD=yes\n```\n\nTo append a suffix to Redis program names, add the following flag:\n\n```sh\nmake PROG_SUFFIX=\"-alt\"\n```\n\nYou can build a 32 bit Redis binary using:\n\n```sh\nmake 32bit\n```\n\nAfter building Redis, it is a good idea to test it using:\n\n```sh\nmake test\n```\n\nIf TLS is built, running the tests with TLS enabled (you will need `tcl-tls` installed):\n\n```sh\n./utils/gen-test-certs.sh\n./runtest --tls\n```\n\n### Fixing build problems with dependencies or cached build options\n\nRedis has some dependencies which are included in the `deps` directory. `make` does not automatically rebuild dependencies even if something in the source code of dependencies changes.\n\nWhen you update the source code with `git pull` or when code inside the dependencies tree is modified in any other way, make sure to use the following command in order to really clean everything and rebuild from scratch:\n\n```sh\nmake distclean\n```\n\nThis will clean: jemalloc, lua, hiredis, linenoise and other dependencies.\n\nAlso, if you force certain build options like 32bit target, no C compiler optimizations (for debugging purposes), and other similar build time options, those options are cached indefinitely until you issue a `make distclean`\ncommand.\n\n### Fixing problems building 32 bit binaries\n\nIf after building Redis with a 32 bit target you need to rebuild it\nwith a 64 bit target, or the other way around, you need to perform a `make distclean` in the root directory of the Redis distribution.\n\nIn case of build errors when trying to build a 32 bit binary of Redis, try the following steps:\n\n- Install the package libc6-dev-i386 (also try g++-multilib).\n- Try using the following command line instead of `make 32bit`:\n  `make CFLAGS=\"-m32 -march=native\" LDFLAGS=\"-m32\"`\n\n### Allocator\n\nSelecting a non-default memory allocator when building Redis is done by setting the `MALLOC` environment variable. Redis is compiled and linked against libc malloc by default, except for jemalloc being the default on Linux systems. This default was picked because jemalloc has proven to have fewer fragmentation problems than libc malloc.\n\nTo force compiling against libc malloc, use:\n\n```sh\nmake MALLOC=libc\n```\n\nTo compile against jemalloc on Mac OS X systems, use:\n\n```sh\nmake MALLOC=jemalloc\n```\n\n### Monotonic clock\n\nBy default, Redis will build using the POSIX clock_gettime function as the monotonic clock source. On most modern systems, the internal processor clock can be used to improve performance. Cautions can be found here: http://oliveryang.net/2015/09/pitfalls-of-TSC-usage/\n\nTo build with support for the processor's internal instruction clock, use:\n\n```sh\nmake CFLAGS=\"-DUSE_PROCESSOR_CLOCK\"\n```\n\n### Verbose build\n\nRedis will build with a user-friendly colorized output by default.\nIf you want to see a more verbose output, use the following:\n\n```sh\nmake V=1\n```\n\n### Running Redis with TLS\n\nPlease consult the [TLS.md](TLS.md) file for more information on how to use Redis with TLS.\n\n### Running Redis with the Query Engine and optional proprietary Intel SVS-VAMANA optimisations\n\n**License Disclaimer**\nIf you are using Redis Open Source under AGPLv3 or SSPLv1, you cannot use it together with the Intel Optimizations (Leanvec and LVQ binaries). The reason is that the Intel SVS license is not compatible with those licenses.\nThe Leanvec and LVQ techniques are closed source and are only available for use with Redis Open Source when distributed under the RSALv2 license.\nFor more details, please refer to the information provided by Intel [here](https://github.com/intel/ScalableVectorSearch).\n\nBy default, Redis with the Redis Query Engine supports SVS-VAMANA index with global 8-bit quantisation. To compile Redis with the Intel SVS-VAMANA optimisations, LeanVec and LVQ, use the following:\n\n```sh\nmake BUILD_INTEL_SVS_OPT=yes\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can export the variable before running the build step for your platform:\n\n```sh\nexport BUILD_INTEL_SVS_OPT=yes\nmake\n```\n\n\n## Code contributions\n\nBy contributing code to the Redis project in any form, including sending a pull request via GitHub, a code fragment or patch via private email or public discussion groups, you agree to release your code under the terms of the Redis Software Grant and Contributor License Agreement.

The\nbook reflects the latest release, whereas the\n[readme on GitHub](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.md)\nreflects latest master.\n\n(中文文档在 [这里](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/README.中文.md),\n快看过来!)\n\nCommands, called recipes, are stored in a file called `justfile` with syntax\ninspired by `make`:\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casey/just/master/screenshot.png)\n\nYou can then run them with `just RECIPE`:\n\n```console\n$ just test-all\ncc *.c -o main\n./test --all\nYay, all your tests passed!\n```\n\n`just` has a ton of useful features, and many improvements over `make`:\n\n- `just` is a command runner, not a build system, so it avoids much of\n  [`make`'s complexity and idiosyncrasies](#what-are-the-idiosyncrasies-of-make-that-just-avoids).\n  No need for `.PHONY` recipes!\n\n- Linux, MacOS, Windows, and other reasonable unices are supported with no\n  additional dependencies. (Although if your system doesn't have an `sh`,\n  you'll need to [choose a different shell](#shell).)\n\n- Errors are specific and informative, and syntax errors are reported along\n  with their source context.\n\n- Recipes can accept [command line arguments](#recipe-parameters).\n\n- Wherever possible, errors are resolved statically. Unknown recipes and\n  circular dependencies are reported before anything runs.\n\n- `just` [loads `.env` files](#dotenv-settings), making it easy to populate\n  environment variables.\n\n- Recipes can be [listed from the command line](#listing-available-recipes).\n\n- Command line completion scripts are\n  [available for most popular shells](#shell-completion-scripts).\n\n- Recipes can be written in\n  [arbitrary languages](#shebang-recipes), like Python or NodeJS.\n\n- `just` can be invoked from any subdirectory, not just the directory that\n  contains the `justfile`.\n\n- And [much more](https://just.systems/man/en/)!\n\nIf you need help with `just` please feel free to open an issue or ping me on\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/ezYScXR). Feature requests and bug reports are\nalways welcome!\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n`just` should run on any system with a reasonable `sh`, including Linux, MacOS,\nand the BSDs.\n\n#### Windows\n\nOn Windows, `just` works with the `sh` provided by\n[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com),\n[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), or\n[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com). After installation, `sh` must be\navailable in the `PATH` of the shell you want to to invoke `just` from.\n\nIf you'd rather not install `sh`, you can use the `shell` setting to use the\nshell of your choice.\n\nLike PowerShell:\n\n```just\n# use PowerShell instead of sh:\nset shell := [\"powershell.exe\", \"-c\"]\n\nhello:\n  Write-Host \"Hello, world!\"\n```\n\n…or `cmd.exe`:\n\n```just\n# use cmd.exe instead of sh:\nset shell := [\"cmd.exe\", \"/c\"]\n\nlist:\n  dir\n```\n\nYou can also set the shell using command-line arguments. For example, to use\nPowerShell, launch `just` with `--shell powershell.exe --shell-arg -c`.\n\n(PowerShell is installed by default on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2\nS1 and later, and `cmd.exe` is quite fiddly, so PowerShell is recommended for\nmost Windows users.)\n\n### Packages\n\n#### Cross-platform\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Package Manager</th>\n

on\n[the releases page](https://github.com/casey/just/releases).\n\nYou can use the following command on Linux, MacOS, or Windows to download the\nlatest release, just replace `DEST` with the directory where you'd like to put\n`just`:\n\n```console\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to DEST\n```\n\nFor example, to install `just` to `~/bin`:\n\n```console\n# create ~/bin\nmkdir -p ~/bin\n\n# download and extract just to ~/bin/just\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/bin\n\n# add `~/bin` to the paths that your shell searches for executables\n# this line should be added to your shells initialization file,\n# e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/bin\"\n\n# just should now be executable\njust --help\n```\n\nNote that `install.sh` may fail on GitHub Actions, or in other environments\nwhere many machines share IP addresses. `install.sh` calls GitHub APIs in order\nto determine the latest version of `just` to install, and those API calls are\nrate-limited on a per-IP basis. To make `install.sh` more reliable in such\ncircumstances, pass a specific tag to install with `--tag`.\n\nAnother way to avoid rate-limiting is to pass a GitHub authentication token to\n`install.sh` as an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN`, allowing it to\nauthenticate its requests.\n\n[Releases](https://github.com/casey/just/releases) include a `SHA256SUM` file\nwhich can be used to verify the integrity of pre-built binary archives.\n\nTo verify a release, download the pre-built binary archive along with the\n`SHA256SUM` file and run:\n\n```sh\nshasum --algorithm 256 --ignore-missing --check SHA256SUMS\n```\n\n### GitHub Actions\n\n`just` can be installed on GitHub Actions in a few ways.\n\nUsing package managers pre-installed on GitHub Actions runners on MacOS with\n`brew install just`, and on Windows with `choco install just`.\n\nWith [extractions/setup-just](https://github.com/extractions/setup-just):\n\n```yaml\n- uses: extractions/setup-just@v3\n  with:\n    just-version: 1.5.0  # optional semver specification, otherwise latest\n```\n\nOr with [taiki-e/install-action](https://github.com/taiki-e/install-action):\n\n```yaml\n- uses: taiki-e/install-action@just\n```\n\n### Release RSS Feed\n\nAn [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of `just` releases is available [here](https://github.com/casey/just/releases.atom).\n\n### Node.js Installation\n\n[just-install](https://npmjs.com/package/just-install) can be used to automate\ninstallation of `just` in Node.js applications.\n\n`just` is a great, more robust alternative to npm scripts. If you want to\ninclude `just` in the dependencies of a Node.js application, `just-install`\nwill install a local, platform-specific binary as part of the `npm install`\ncommand. This removes the need for every developer to install `just`\nindependently using one of the processes mentioned above. After installation,\nthe `just` command will work in npm scripts or with npx. It's great for teams\nwho want to make the set up process for their project as easy as possible.\n\nFor more information, see the\n[just-install README file](https://github.com/brombal/just-install#readme).\n\nBackwards Compatibility\n-----------------------\n\nWith the release of version 1.0, `just` features a strong commitment to\nbackwards compatibility and stability.\n\nFuture releases will not introduce backwards incompatible changes that make\nexisting `justfile`s stop working, or break working invocations of the\ncommand-line interface.\n\nThis does not, however, preclude fixing outright bugs, even if doing so might\nbreak `justfiles` that rely on their behavior.\n\nThere will never be a `just` 2.0. Any desirable backwards-incompatible changes\nwill be opt-in on a per-`justfile` basis, so users may migrate at their\nleisure.\n\nFeatures that aren't yet ready for stabilization are marked as unstable and may\nbe changed or removed at any time. Using unstable features produces an error by\ndefault, which can be suppressed with by passing the `--unstable` flag,\n`set unstable`, or setting the environment variable `JUST_UNSTABLE`, to any\nvalue other than `false`, `0`, or the empty string.\n\nEditor Support\n--------------\n\n`justfile` syntax is close enough to `make` that you may want to tell your\neditor to use `make` syntax highlighting for `just`.\n\n### Vim and Neovim\n\nVim version 9.1.1042 or better and Neovim version 0.11 or better support\nJustfile syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to\n[pbnj](https://github.com/pbnj).\n\n#### `vim-just`\n\nThe [vim-just](https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just) plugin provides syntax\nhighlighting for `justfile`s.\n\nInstall it with your favorite package manager, like\n[Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):\n\n```vim\ncall plug#begin()\n\nPlug 'NoahTheDuke/vim-just'\n\ncall plug#end()\n```\n\nOr with Vim's built-in package support:\n\n```console\nmkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start\ncd ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start\ngit clone https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just.git\n```\n\n#### `tree-sitter-just`\n\n[tree-sitter-just](https://github.com/IndianBoy42/tree-sitter-just) is an\n[Nvim Treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) plugin\nfor Neovim.\n\n#### Makefile Syntax Highlighting\n\nVim's built-in makefile syntax highlighting isn't perfect for `justfile`s, but\nit's better than nothing. You can put the following in `~/.vim/filetype.vim`:\n\n```vimscript\nif exists(\"did_load_filetypes\")\n  finish\nendif\n\naugroup filetypedetect\n  au BufNewFile,BufRead justfile setf make\naugroup END\n```\n\nOr add the following to an individual `justfile` to enable `make` mode on a\nper-file basis:\n\n```text\n# vim: set ft=make :\n```\n\n### Emacs\n\n[just-mode](https://github.com/leon-barrett/just-mode.el) provides syntax\nhighlighting and automatic indentation of `justfile`s. It is available on\n[MELPA](https://melpa.org/) as [just-mode](https://melpa.org/#/just-mode).\n\n[justl](https://github.com/psibi/justl.el) provides commands for executing and\nlisting recipes.\n\nYou can add the following to an individual `justfile` to enable `make` mode on\na per-file basis:\n\n```text\n# Local Variables:\n# mode: makefile\n# End:\n```\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n\nAn extension for VS Code is [available here](https://github.com/nefrob/vscode-just).\n\nUnmaintained VS Code extensions include\n[skellock/vscode-just](https://github.com/skellock/vscode-just) and\n[sclu1034/vscode-just](https://github.com/sclu1034/vscode-just).\n\n### JetBrains IDEs\n\nA plugin for JetBrains IDEs by [linux_china](https://github.com/linux-china) is\n[available here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18658-just).\n\n### Kakoune\n\nKakoune supports `justfile` syntax highlighting out of the box, thanks to\nTeddyDD.\n\n### Helix\n\n[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) supports `justfile` syntax highlighting\nout-of-the-box since version 23.05.\n\n### Sublime Text\n\nThe [Just package](https://github.com/nk9/just_sublime) by\n[nk9](https://github.com/nk9) with `just` syntax and some other tools is\navailable on [PackageControl](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Just).\n\n### Micro\n\n[Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) supports Justfile syntax highlighting\nout of the box, thanks to [tomodachi94](https://github.com/tomodachi94).\n\n### Zed\n\nThe [zed-just](https://github.com/jackTabsCode/zed-just/) extension by\n[jackTabsCode](https://github.com/jackTabsCode) is avilable on the\n[Zed extensions page](https://zed.dev/extensions?query=just).\n\n### Other Editors\n\nFeel free to send me the commands necessary to get syntax highlighting working\nin your editor of choice so that I may include them here.\n\n### Language Server Protocol\n\n[just-lsp](https://github.com/terror/just-lsp) provides a [language server\nprotocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol)\nimplementation, enabling features such as go-to-definition, inline diagnostics,\nand code completion.\n\n### Model Context Protocol\n\n[just-mcp](http://github.com/promptexecution/just-mcp) provides a\n[model context protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol)\nadapter to allow LLMs to query the contents of `justfiles` and run recipes.\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nSee the installation section for how to install `just` on your computer. Try\nrunning `just --version` to make sure that it's installed correctly.\n\nFor an overview of the syntax, check out\n[this cheatsheet](https://cheatography.com/linux-china/cheat-sheets/justfile/).\n\nOnce `just` is installed and working, create a file named `justfile` in the\nroot of your project with the following contents:\n\n```just\nrecipe-name:\n  echo 'This is a recipe!'\n\n# this is a comment\nanother-recipe:\n  @echo 'This is another recipe.'\n```\n\nWhen you invoke `just` it looks for file `justfile` in the current directory\nand upwards, so you can invoke it from any subdirectory of your project.\n\nThe search for a `justfile` is case insensitive, so any case, like `Justfile`,\n`JUSTFILE`, or `JuStFiLe`, will work. `just` will also look for files with the\nname `.justfile`, in case you'd like to hide a `justfile`.\n\nRunning `just` with no arguments runs the first recipe in the `justfile`:\n\n```console\n$ just\necho 'This is a recipe!'\nThis is a recipe!\n```\n\nOne or more arguments specify the recipe(s) to run:\n\n```console\n$ just another-recipe\nThis is another recipe.\n```\n\n`just` prints each command to standard error before running it, which is why\n`echo 'This is a recipe!'` was printed. This is suppressed for lines starting\nwith `@`, which is why `echo 'This is another recipe.'` was not printed.\n\nRecipes stop running if a command fails. Here `cargo publish` will only run if\n`cargo test` succeeds:\n\n```just\npublish:\n  cargo test\n  # tests passed, time to publish!\n  cargo publish\n```\n\nRecipes can depend on other recipes. Here the `test` recipe depends on the\n`build` recipe, so `build` will run before `test`:\n\n```just\nbuild:\n  cc main.c foo.c bar.c -o main\n\ntest: build\n  ./test\n\nsloc:\n  @echo \"`wc -l *.c` lines of code\"\n```\n\n```console\n$ just test\ncc main.c foo.c bar.c -o main\n./test\ntesting… all tests passed!\n```\n\nRecipes without dependencies will run in the order they're given on the command\nline:\n\n```console\n$ just build sloc\ncc main.c foo.c bar.c -o main\n1337 lines of code\n```\n\nDependencies will always run first, even if they are passed after a recipe that\ndepends on them:\n\n```console\n$ just test build\ncc main.c foo.c bar.c -o main\n./test\ntesting… all tests passed!\n```\n\nRecipes may depend on recipes in submodules:\n\n```justfile\nmod foo\n\nbaz: foo::bar\n```\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nA variety of `justfile`s can be found in the\n[examples directory](https://github.com/casey/just/tree/master/examples) and on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=path%3A**%2Fjustfile&type=code).\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n### The Default Recipe\n\nWhen `just` is invoked without a recipe, it runs the recipe with the\n`[default]` attribute, or the first recipe in the `justfile` if no recipe has\nthe `[default]` attribute.\n\nThis recipe might be the most frequently run command in the project, like\nrunning the tests:\n\n```just\ntest:\n  cargo test\n```\n\nYou can also use dependencies to run multiple recipes by default:\n\n```just\ndefault: lint build test\n\nbuild:\n  echo Building…\n\ntest:\n  echo Testing…\n\nlint:\n  echo Linting…\n```\n\nIf no recipe makes sense as the default recipe, you can add a recipe to the\nbeginning of your `justfile` that lists the available recipes:\n\n```just\ndefault:\n  just --list\n```\n\n### Listing Available Recipes\n\nRecipes can be listed in alphabetical order with `just --list`:\n\n```console\n$ just --list\nAvailable recipes:\n    build\n    test\n    deploy\n    lint\n```\n\nRecipes in [submodules](#modules1190) can be listed with `just --list PATH`,\nwhere `PATH` is a space- or `::`-separated module path:\n\n```\n$ cat justfile\nmod foo\n$ cat foo.just\nmod bar\n$ cat bar.just\nbaz:\n$ just --list foo bar\nAvailable recipes:\n    baz\n$ just --list foo::bar\nAvailable recipes:\n    baz\n```\n\n`just --summary` is more concise:\n\n```console\n$ just --summary\nbuild test deploy lint\n```\n\nPass `--unsorted` to print recipes in the order they appear in the `justfile`:\n\n```just\ntest:\n  echo 'Testing!'\n\nbuild:\n  echo 'Building!'\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --list --unsorted\nAvailable recipes:\n    test\n    build\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --summary --unsorted\ntest build\n```\n\nIf you'd like `just` to default to listing the recipes in the `justfile`, you\ncan use this as your default recipe:\n\n```just\ndefault:\n  @just --list\n```\n\nNote that you may need to add `--justfile {{justfile()}}` to the line above.\nWithout it, if you executed `just -f /some/distant/justfile -d .` or\n`just -f ./non-standard-justfile`, the plain `just --list` inside the recipe\nwould not necessarily use the file you provided. It would try to find a\njustfile in your current path, maybe even resulting in a `No justfile found`\nerror.\n\nThe heading text can be customized with `--list-heading`:\n\n```console\n$ just --list --list-heading $'Cool stuff…\\n'\nCool stuff…\n    test\n    build\n```\n\nAnd the indentation can be customized with `--list-prefix`:\n\n```console\n$ just --list --list-prefix ····\nAvailable recipes:\n····test\n····build\n```\n\nThe argument to `--list-heading` replaces both the heading and the newline\nfollowing it, so it should contain a newline if non-empty. It works this way so\nyou can suppress the heading line entirely by passing the empty string:\n\n```console\n$ just --list --list-heading ''\n    test\n    build\n```\n\n### Invoking Multiple Recipes\n\nMultiple recipes may be invoked on the command line at once:\n\n```just\nbuild:\n  make web\n\nserve:\n  python3 -m http.server -d out 8000\n```\n\n```console\n$ just build serve\nmake web\npython3 -m http.server -d out 8000\n```\n\nKeep in mind that recipes with parameters will swallow arguments, even if they\nmatch the names of other recipes:\n\n```just\nbuild project:\n  make {{project}}\n\nserve:\n  python3 -m http.server -d out 8000\n```\n\n```console\n$ just build serve\nmake: *** No rule to make target `serve'.  Stop.\n```\n\nThe `--one` flag can be used to restrict command-line invocations to a single\nrecipe:\n\n```console\n$ just --one build serve\nerror: Expected 1 command-line recipe invocation but found 2.\n```\n\n### Working Directory\n\nBy default, recipes run with the working directory set to the directory that\ncontains the `justfile`.\n\nThe `[no-cd]` attribute can be used to make recipes run with the working\ndirectory set to directory in which `just` was invoked.\n\n```just\n@foo:\n  pwd\n\n[no-cd]\n@bar:\n  pwd\n```\n\n```console\n$ cd subdir\n$ just foo\n/\n$ just bar\n/subdir\n```\n\nYou can override the working directory for all recipes with\n`set working-directory := '…'`:\n\n```just\nset working-directory := 'bar'\n\n@foo:\n  pwd\n```\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n/home/bob\n$ just foo\n/home/bob/bar\n```\n\nYou can override the working directory for a specific recipe with the\n`working-directory` attribute<sup>1.38.0</sup>:\n\n```just\n[working-directory: 'bar']\n@foo:\n  pwd\n```\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n/home/bob\n$ just foo\n/home/bob/bar\n```\n\nThe argument to the `working-directory` setting or `working-directory`\nattribute may be absolute or relative. If it is relative it is interpreted\nrelative to the default working directory.\n\n### Aliases\n\nAliases allow recipes to be invoked on the command line with alternative names:\n\n```just\nalias b := build\n\nbuild:\n  echo 'Building!'\n```\n\n```console\n$ just b\necho 'Building!'\nBuilding!\n```\n\nThe target of an alias may be a recipe in a submodule:\n\n```justfile\nmod foo\n\nalias baz := foo::bar\n```\n\n### Settings\n\nSettings control interpretation and execution. Each setting may be specified at\nmost once, anywhere in the `justfile`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```just\nset shell := [\"zsh\", \"-cu\"]\n\nfoo:\n  # this line will be run as `zsh -cu 'ls **/*.txt'`\n  ls **/*.txt\n```\n\n#### Table of Settings\n\n| Name | Value | Default | Description |\n|------|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `allow-duplicate-recipes` | boolean | `false` | Allow recipes appearing later in a `justfile` to override earlier recipes with the same name. |\n| `allow-duplicate-variables` | boolean | `false` | Allow variables appearing later in a `justfile` to override earlier variables with the same name. |\n| `dotenv-filename` | string | - | Load a `.env` file with a custom name, if present. |\n| `dotenv-load` | boolean | `false` | Load a `.env` file, if present. |\n| `dotenv-override` | boolean | `false` | Override existing environment variables with values from the `.env` file. |\n| `dotenv-path` | string | - | Load a `.env` file from a custom path and error if not present. Overrides `dotenv-filename`. |\n| `dotenv-required` | boolean | `false` | Error if a `.env` file isn't found. |\n| `export` | boolean | `false` | Export all variables as environment variables. |\n| `fallback` | boolean | `false` | Search `justfile` in parent directory if the first recipe on the command line is not found. |\n| `ignore-comments` | boolean | `false` | Ignore recipe lines beginning with `#`. |\n| `positional-arguments` | boolean | `false` | Pass positional arguments. |\n| `quiet` | boolean | `false` | Disable echoing recipe lines before executing. |\n| `script-interpreter`<sup>1.33.0</sup> | `[COMMAND, ARGS…]` | `['sh', '-eu']` | Set command used to invoke recipes with empty `[script]` attribute. |\n| `shell` | `[COMMAND, ARGS…]` | - | Set command used to invoke recipes and evaluate backticks. |\n| `tempdir` | string | - | Create temporary directories in `tempdir` instead of the system default temporary directory. |\n| `unstable`<sup>1.31.0</sup> | boolean | `false` | Enable unstable features. |\n| `windows-powershell` | boolean | `false` | Use PowerShell on Windows as default shell. (Deprecated. Use `windows-shell` instead. |\n| `windows-shell` | `[COMMAND, ARGS…]` | - | Set the command used to invoke recipes and evaluate backticks. |\n| `working-directory`<sup>1.33.0</sup> | string | - | Set the working directory for recipes and backticks, relative to the default working directory. |\n\nBoolean settings can be written as:\n\n```justfile\nset NAME\n```\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n```justfile\nset NAME := true\n```\n\nNon-boolean settings can be set to both strings and\nexpressions.<sup>1.46.0</sup>\n\nHowever, because settings affect the behavior of backticks and many functions,\nthose expressions may not contain backticks or function calls, directly or\ntransitively via reference.\n\n#### Allow Duplicate Recipes\n\nIf `allow-duplicate-recipes` is set to `true`, defining multiple recipes with\nthe same name is not an error and the last definition is used. Defaults to\n`false`.\n\n```just\nset allow-duplicate-recipes\n\n@foo:\n  echo foo\n\n@foo:\n  echo bar\n```\n\n```console\n$ just foo\nbar\n```\n\n#### Allow Duplicate Variables\n\nIf `allow-duplicate-variables` is set to `true`, defining multiple variables\nwith the same name is not an error and the last definition is used. Defaults to\n`false`.\n\n```just\nset allow-duplicate-variables\n\na := \"foo\"\na := \"bar\"\n\n@foo:\n  echo {{a}}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just foo\nbar\n```\n\n#### Dotenv Settings\n\nIf any of `dotenv-load`, `dotenv-filename`, `dotenv-override`, `dotenv-path`,\nor `dotenv-required` are set, `just` will try to load environment variables\nfrom a file.\n\nIf `dotenv-path` is set, `just` will look for a file at the given path, which\nmay be absolute, or relative to the working directory.\n\nThe command-line option `--dotenv-path`, short form `-E`, can be used to set or\noverride `dotenv-path` at runtime.\n\nIf `dotenv-filename` is set `just` will look for a file at the given path,\nrelative to the working directory and each of its ancestors.\n\nIf `dotenv-filename` is not set, but `dotenv-load` or `dotenv-required` are\nset, just will look for a file named `.env`, relative to the working directory\nand each of its ancestors.\n\n`dotenv-filename` and `dotenv-path` are similar, but `dotenv-path` is only\nchecked relative to the working directory, whereas `dotenv-filename` is checked\nrelative to the working directory and each of its ancestors.\n\nIt is not an error if an environment file is not found, unless\n`dotenv-required` is set.\n\nThe loaded variables are environment variables, not `just` variables, and so\nmust be accessed using `$VARIABLE_NAME` in recipes and backticks.\n\nIf `dotenv-override` is set, variables from the environment file will override\nexisting environment variables.\n\nFor example, if your `.env` file contains:\n\n```console\n# a comment, will be ignored\nDATABASE_ADDRESS=localhost:6379\nSERVER_PORT=1337\n```\n\nAnd your `justfile` contains:\n\n```just\nset dotenv-load\n\nserve:\n  @echo \"Starting server with database $DATABASE_ADDRESS on port $SERVER_PORT…\"\n  ./server --database $DATABASE_ADDRESS --port $SERVER_PORT\n```\n\n`just serve` will output:\n\n```console\n$ just serve\nStarting server with database localhost:6379 on port 1337…\n./server --database $DATABASE_ADDRESS --port $SERVER_PORT\n```\n\n#### Export\n\nThe `export` setting causes all `just` variables to be exported as environment\nvariables. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```just\nset export\n\na := \"hello\"\n\n@foo b:\n  echo $a\n  echo $b\n```\n\n```console\n$ just foo goodbye\nhello\ngoodbye\n```\n\n#### Positional Arguments\n\nIf `positional-arguments` is `true`, recipe arguments will be passed as\npositional arguments to commands. For linewise recipes, argument `$0` will be\nthe name of the recipe.\n\nFor example, running this recipe:\n\n```just\nset positional-arguments\n\n@foo bar:\n  echo $0\n  echo $1\n```\n\nWill produce the following output:\n\n```console\n$ just foo hello\nfoo\nhello\n```\n\nWhen using an `sh`-compatible shell, such as `bash` or `zsh`, `$@` expands to\nthe positional arguments given to the recipe, starting from one. When used\nwithin double quotes as `\"$@\"`, arguments including whitespace will be passed\non as if they were double-quoted. That is, `\"$@\"` is equivalent to `\"$1\" \"$2\"`…\nWhen there are no positional parameters, `\"$@\"` and `$@` expand to nothing\n(i.e., they are removed).\n\nThis example recipe will print arguments one by one on separate lines:\n\n```just\nset positional-arguments\n\n@test *args='':\n  bash -c 'while (( \"$#\" )); do echo - $1; shift; done' -- \"$@\"\n```\n\nRunning it with _two_ arguments:\n\n```console\n$ just test foo \"bar baz\"\n- foo\n- bar baz\n```\n\nPositional arguments may also be turned on on a per-recipe basis with the\n`[positional-arguments]` attribute<sup>1.29.0</sup>:\n\n```just\n[positional-arguments]\n@foo bar:\n  echo $0\n  echo $1\n```\n\nNote that PowerShell does not handle positional arguments in the same way as\nother shells, so turning on positional arguments will likely break recipes that\nuse PowerShell.\n\nIf using PowerShell 7.4 or better, the `-CommandWithArgs` flag will make\npositional arguments work as expected:\n\n```just\nset shell := ['pwsh.exe', '-CommandWithArgs']\nset positional-arguments\n\nprint-args a b c:\n  Write-Output @($args[1..($args.Count - 1)])\n```\n\n#### Shell\n\nThe `shell` setting controls the command used to invoke recipe lines and\nbackticks. Shebang recipes are unaffected. The default shell is `sh -cu`.\n\n```just\n# use python3 to execute recipe lines and backticks\nset shell := [\"python3\", \"-c\"]\n\n# use print to capture result of evaluation\nfoos := `print(\"foo\" * 4)`\n\nfoo:\n  print(\"Snake snake snake snake.\")\n  print(\"{{foos}}\")\n```\n\n`just` passes the command to be executed as an argument. Many shells will need\nan additional flag, often `-c`, to make them evaluate the first argument.\n\n##### Windows Shell\n\n`just` uses `sh` on Windows by default. To use a different shell on Windows,\nuse `windows-shell`:\n\n```just\nset windows-shell := [\"powershell.exe\", \"-NoLogo\", \"-Command\"]\n\nhello:\n  Write-Host \"Hello, world!\"\n```\n\nSee\n[powershell.just](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/examples/powershell.just)\nfor a justfile that uses PowerShell on all platforms.\n\n##### Windows PowerShell\n\n*`set windows-powershell` uses the legacy `powershell.exe` binary, and is no\nlonger recommended. See the `windows-shell` setting above for a more flexible\nway to control which shell is used on Windows.*\n\n`just` uses `sh` on Windows by default. To use `powershell.exe` instead, set\n`windows-powershell` to true.\n\n```just\nset windows-powershell := true\n\nhello:\n  Write-Host \"Hello, world!\"\n```\n\n##### Python 3\n\n```just\nset shell := [\"python3\", \"-c\"]\n```\n\n##### Bash\n\n```just\nset shell := [\"bash\", \"-uc\"]\n```\n\n##### Z Shell\n\n```just\nset shell := [\"zsh\", \"-uc\"]\n```\n\n##### Fish\n\n```just\nset shell := [\"fish\", \"-c\"]\n```\n\n##### Nushell\n\n```just\nset shell := [\"nu\", \"-c\"]\n```\n\nIf you want to change the default table mode to `light`:\n\n```just\nset shell := ['nu', '-m', 'light', '-c']\n```\n\n*[Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) was written in Rust, and **has\ncross-platform support for Windows / macOS and Linux**.*\n\n### Documentation Comments\n\nComments immediately preceding a recipe will appear in `just --list`:\n\n```just\n# build stuff\nbuild:\n  ./bin/build\n\n# test stuff\ntest:\n  ./bin/test\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --list\nAvailable recipes:\n    build # build stuff\n    test # test stuff\n```\n\nThe `[doc]` attribute can be used to set or suppress a recipe's doc comment:\n\n```just\n# This comment won't appear\n[doc('Build stuff')]\nbuild:\n  ./bin/build\n\n# This one won't either\n[doc]\ntest:\n  ./bin/test\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --list\nAvailable recipes:\n    build # Build stuff\n    test\n```\n\n### Expressions and Substitutions\n\nVarious operators and function calls are supported in expressions, which may be\nused in assignments, default recipe arguments, and inside recipe body `{{…}}`\nsubstitutions.\n\n```just\ntmpdir  := `mktemp -d`\nversion := \"0.2.7\"\ntardir  := tmpdir / \"awesomesauce-\" + version\ntarball := tardir + \".tar.gz\"\nconfig  := quote(config_dir() / \".project-config\")\n\npublish:\n  rm -f {{tarball}}\n  mkdir {{tardir}}\n  cp README.md *.c {{ config }} {{tardir}}\n  tar zcvf {{tarball}} {{tardir}}\n  scp {{tarball}} me@server.com:release/\n  rm -rf {{tarball}} {{tardir}}\n```\n\n#### Concatenation\n\nThe `+` operator returns the left-hand argument concatenated with the\nright-hand argument:\n\n```just\nfoobar := 'foo' + 'bar'\n```\n\n#### Logical Operators\n\nThe logical operators `&&` and `||` can be used to coalesce string\nvalues<sup>1.37.0</sup>, similar to Python's `and` and `or`. These operators\nconsider the empty string `''` to be false, and all other strings to be true.\n\nThese operators are currently unstable.\n\nThe `&&` operator returns the empty string if the left-hand argument is the\nempty string, otherwise it returns the right-hand argument:\n\n```justfile\nfoo := '' && 'goodbye'      # ''\nbar := 'hello' && 'goodbye' # 'goodbye'\n```\n\nThe `||` operator returns the left-hand argument if it is non-empty, otherwise\nit returns the right-hand argument:\n\n```justfile\nfoo := '' || 'goodbye'      # 'goodbye'\nbar := 'hello' || 'goodbye' # 'hello'\n```\n\n#### Joining Paths\n\nThe `/` operator can be used to join two strings with a slash:\n\n```just\nfoo := \"a\" / \"b\"\n```\n\n```\n$ just --evaluate foo\na/b\n```\n\nNote that a `/` is added even if one is already present:\n\n```just\nfoo := \"a/\"\nbar := foo / \"b\"\n```\n\n```\n$ just --evaluate bar\na//b\n```\n\nAbsolute paths can also be constructed<sup>1.5.0</sup>:\n\n```just\nfoo := / \"b\"\n```\n\n```\n$ just --evaluate foo\n/b\n```\n\nThe `/` operator uses the `/` character, even on Windows. Thus, using the `/`\noperator should be avoided with paths that use universal naming convention\n(UNC), i.e., those that start with `\\?`, since forward slashes are not\nsupported with UNC paths.\n\n#### Escaping `{{`\n\nTo write a recipe containing `{{`, use `{{{{`:\n\n```just\nbraces:\n  echo 'I {{{{LOVE}} curly braces!'\n```\n\n(An unmatched `}}` is ignored, so it doesn't need to be escaped.)\n\nAnother option is to put all the text you'd like to escape inside of an\ninterpolation:\n\n```just\nbraces:\n  echo '{{'I {{LOVE}} curly braces!'}}'\n```\n\nYet another option is to use `{{ \"{{\" }}`:\n\n```just\nbraces:\n  echo 'I {{ \"{{\" }}LOVE}} curly braces!'\n```\n\n### Strings\n\n`'single'`, `\"double\"`, and `'''triple'''` quoted string literals are\nsupported. Unlike in recipe bodies, `{{…}}` interpolations are not supported\ninside strings.\n\nDouble-quoted strings support escape sequences:\n\n```just\ncarriage-return   := \"\\r\"\ndouble-quote      := \"\\\"\"\nnewline           := \"\\n\"\nno-newline        := \"\\\n\"\nslash             := \"\\\\\"\ntab               := \"\\t\"\nunicode-codepoint := \"\\u{1F916}\"\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --evaluate\n\"arriage-return   := \"\ndouble-quote      := \"\"\"\nnewline           := \"\n\"\nno-newline        := \"\"\nslash             := \"\\\"\ntab               := \"     \"\nunicode-codepoint := \"🤖\"\n```\n\nThe unicode character escape sequence `\\u{…}`<sup>1.36.0</sup> accepts up to\nsix hex digits.\n\nStrings may contain line breaks:\n\n```just\nsingle := '\nhello\n'\n\ndouble := \"\ngoodbye\n\"\n```\n\nSingle-quoted strings do not recognize escape sequences:\n\n```just\nescapes := '\\t\\n\\r\\\"\\\\'\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --evaluate\nescapes := \"\\t\\n\\r\\\"\\\\\"\n```\n\nIndented versions of both single- and double-quoted strings, delimited by\ntriple single- or double-quotes, are supported. Indented string lines are\nstripped of a leading line break, and leading whitespace common to all\nnon-blank lines:\n\n```just\n# this string will evaluate to `foo\\nbar\\n`\nx := '''\n  foo\n  bar\n'''\n\n# this string will evaluate to `abc\\n  wuv\\nxyz\\n`\ny := \"\"\"\n  abc\n    wuv\n  xyz\n\"\"\"\n```\n\nSimilar to unindented strings, indented double-quoted strings process escape\nsequences, and indented single-quoted strings ignore escape sequences. Escape\nsequence processing takes place after unindentation. The unindentation\nalgorithm does not take escape-sequence produced whitespace or newlines into\naccount.\n\n#### Shell-expanded strings\n\nStrings prefixed with `x` are shell expanded<sup>1.27.0</sup>:\n\n```justfile\nfoobar := x'~/$FOO/${BAR}'\n```\n\n| Value | Replacement |\n|------|-------------|\n| `$VAR` | value of environment variable `VAR` |\n| `${VAR}` | value of environment variable `VAR` |\n| `${VAR:-DEFAULT}` | value of environment variable `VAR`, or `DEFAULT` if `VAR` is not set |\n| Leading `~` | path to current user's home directory |\n| Leading `~USER` | path to `USER`'s home directory |\n\nThis expansion is performed at compile time, so variables from `.env` files and\nexported `just` variables cannot be used. However, this allows shell expanded\nstrings to be used in places like settings and import paths, which cannot\ndepend on `just` variables and `.env` files.\n\n#### Format strings\n\nStrings prefixed with `f` are format strings<sup>1.44.0</sup>:\n\n```justfile\nname := \"world\"\nmessage := f'Hello, {{name}}!'\n```\n\nFormat strings may contain interpolations delimited with `{{…}}` that contain\nexpressions. Format strings evaluate to the concatenated string fragments and\nevaluated expressions.\n\nUse `{{{{` to include a literal `{{` in a format string:\n\n```justfile\nfoo := f'I {{{{LOVE} curly braces!'\n```\n\n### Ignoring Errors\n\nNormally, if a command returns a non-zero exit status, execution will stop. To\ncontinue execution after a command, even if it fails, prefix the command with\n`-`:\n\n```just\nfoo:\n  -cat foo\n  echo 'Done!'\n```\n\n```console\n$ just foo\ncat foo\ncat: foo: No such file or directory\necho 'Done!'\nDone!\n```\n\n### Functions\n\n`just` provides many built-in functions for use in expressions, including\nrecipe body `{{…}}` substitutions, assignments, and default parameter values.\n\nAll functions ending in `_directory` can be abbreviated to `_dir`. So\n`home_directory()` can also be written as `home_dir()`. In addition,\n`invocation_directory_native()` can be abbreviated to\n`invocation_dir_native()`.\n\n#### System Information\n\n- `arch()` — Instruction set architecture. Possible values are: `\"aarch64\"`,\n  `\"arm\"`, `\"asmjs\"`, `\"hexagon\"`, `\"mips\"`, `\"msp430\"`, `\"powerpc\"`,\n  `\"powerpc64\"`, `\"s390x\"`, `\"sparc\"`, `\"wasm32\"`, `\"x86\"`, `\"x86_64\"`, and\n  `\"xcore\"`.\n- `num_cpus()`<sup>1.15.0</sup> - Number of logical CPUs.\n- `os()` — Operating system. Possible values are: `\"android\"`, `\"bitrig\"`,\n  `\"dragonfly\"`, `\"emscripten\"`, `\"freebsd\"`, `\"haiku\"`, `\"ios\"`, `\"linux\"`,\n  `\"macos\"`, `\"netbsd\"`, `\"openbsd\"`, `\"solaris\"`, and `\"windows\"`.\n- `os_family()` — Operating system family; possible values are: `\"unix\"` and\n  `\"windows\"`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```just\nsystem-info:\n  @echo \"This is an {{arch()}} machine\".\n```\n\n```console\n$ just system-info\nThis is an x86_64 machine\n```\n\nThe `os_family()` function can be used to create cross-platform `justfile`s\nthat work on various operating systems. For an example, see\n[cross-platform.just](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/examples/cross-platform.just)\nfile.\n\n#### External Commands\n\n- `shell(command, args...)`<sup>1.27.0</sup> returns the standard output of shell script\n  `command` with zero or more positional arguments `args`. The shell used to\n  interpret `command` is the same shell that is used to evaluate recipe lines,\n  and can be changed with `set shell := […]`.\n\n  `command` is passed as the first argument, so if the command is `'echo $@'`,\n  the full command line, with the default shell command `sh -cu` and `args`\n  `'foo'` and `'bar'` will be:\n\n  ```\n  'sh' '-cu' 'echo $@' 'echo $@' 'foo' 'bar'\n  ```\n\n  This is so that `$@` works as expected, and `$1` refers to the first\n  argument. `$@` does not include the first positional argument, which is\n  expected to be the name of the program being run.\n\n```just\n# arguments can be variables or expressions\nfile := '/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status'\nbat0stat := shell('cat $1', file)\n\n# commands can be variables or expressions\ncommand := 'wc -l'\noutput := shell(command + ' \"$1\"', 'main.c')\n\n# arguments referenced by the shell command must be used\nempty := shell('echo', 'foo')\nfull := shell('echo $1', 'foo')\nerror := shell('echo $1')\n```\n\n```just\n# Using python as the shell. Since `python -c` sets `sys.argv[0]` to `'-c'`,\n# the first \"real\" positional argument will be `sys.argv[2]`.\nset shell := [\"python3\", \"-c\"]\nolleh := shell('import sys; print(sys.argv[2][::-1])', 'hello')\n```\n\n#### Environment Variables\n\n- `env(key)`<sup>1.15.0</sup> — Retrieves the environment variable with name `key`, aborting\n  if it is not present.\n\n```just\nhome_dir := env('HOME')\n\ntest:\n  echo \"{{home_dir}}\"\n```\n\n```console\n$ just\n/home/user1\n```\n\n- `env(key, default)`<sup>1.15.0</sup> — Retrieves the environment variable with\n  name `key`, returning `default` if it is not present.\n- `env_var(key)` — Deprecated alias for `env(key)`.\n- `env_var_or_default(key, default)` — Deprecated alias for `env(key, default)`.\n\nA default can be substituted for an empty environment variable value with the\n`||` operator, currently unstable:\n\n```just\nset unstable\n\nfoo := env('FOO', '') || 'DEFAULT_VALUE'\n```\n\n#### Executables\n\n- `require(name)`<sup>1.39.0</sup> — Search directories in the `PATH`\n  environment variable for the executable `name` and return its full path, or\n  halt with an error if no executable with `name` exists.\n\n  ```just\n  bash := require(\"bash\")\n\n  @test:\n      echo \"bash: '{{bash}}'\"\n  ```\n\n  ```console\n  $ just\n  bash: '/bin/bash'\n  ```\n\n- `which(name)`<sup>1.39.0</sup> — Search directories in the `PATH` environment\n  variable for the executable `name` and return its full path, or the empty\n  string if no executable with `name` exists. Currently unstable.\n\n\n  ```just\n  set unstable\n\n  bosh := which(\"bosh\")\n\n  @test:\n      echo \"bosh: '{{bosh}}'\"\n  ```\n\n  ```console\n  $ just\n  bosh: ''\n  ```\n\n#### Invocation Information\n\n- `is_dependency()` - Returns the string `true` if the current recipe is being\n  run as a dependency of another recipe, rather than being run directly,\n  otherwise returns the string `false`.\n\n#### Invocation Directory\n\n- `invocation_directory()` - Retrieves the absolute path to the current\n  directory when `just` was invoked, before  `just` changed it (chdir'd) prior\n  to executing commands. On Windows, `invocation_directory()` uses `cygpath` to\n  convert the invocation directory to a Cygwin-compatible `/`-separated path.\n  Use `invocation_directory_native()` to return the verbatim invocation\n  directory on all platforms.\n\nFor example, to call `rustfmt` on files just under the \"current directory\"\n(from the user/invoker's perspective), use the following rule:\n\n```just\nrustfmt:\n  find {{invocation_directory()}} -name \\*.rs -exec rustfmt {} \\;\n```\n\nAlternatively, if your command needs to be run from the current directory, you\ncould use (e.g.):\n\n```just\nbuild:\n  cd {{invocation_directory()}}; ./some_script_that_needs_to_be_run_from_here\n```\n\n- `invocation_directory_native()` - Retrieves the absolute path to the current\n  directory when `just` was invoked, before  `just` changed it (chdir'd) prior\n  to executing commands.\n\n#### Justfile and Justfile Directory\n\n- `justfile()` - Retrieves the path of the current `justfile`.\n\n- `justfile_directory()` - Retrieves the path of the parent directory of the\n  current `justfile`.\n\nFor example, to run a command relative to the location of the current\n`justfile`:\n\n```just\nscript:\n  {{justfile_directory()}}/scripts/some_script\n```\n\n#### Source and Source Directory\n\n- `source_file()`<sup>1.27.0</sup> - Retrieves the path of the current source file.\n\n- `source_directory()`<sup>1.27.0</sup> - Retrieves the path of the parent directory of the\n  current source file.\n\n`source_file()` and `source_directory()` behave the same as `justfile()` and\n`justfile_directory()` in the root `justfile`, but will return the path and\ndirectory, respectively, of the current `import` or `mod` source file when\ncalled from within an import or submodule.\n\n#### Just Executable\n\n- `just_executable()` - Absolute path to the `just` executable.\n\nFor example:\n\n```just\nexecutable:\n  @echo The executable is at: {{just_executable()}}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just\nThe executable is at: /bin/just\n```\n\n#### Just Process ID\n\n- `just_pid()` - Process ID of the `just` executable.\n\nFor example:\n\n```just\npid:\n  @echo The process ID is: {{ just_pid() }}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just\nThe process ID is: 420\n```\n\n#### String Manipulation\n\n- `append(suffix, s)`<sup>1.27.0</sup> Append `suffix` to whitespace-separated\n  strings in `s`. `append('/src', 'foo bar baz')` → `'foo/src bar/src baz/src'`\n- `prepend(prefix, s)`<sup>1.27.0</sup> Prepend `prefix` to\n  whitespace-separated strings in `s`. `prepend('src/', 'foo bar baz')` →\n  `'src/foo src/bar src/baz'`\n- `encode_uri_component(s)`<sup>1.27.0</sup> - Percent-encode characters in `s`\n  except `[A-Za-z0-9_.!~*'()-]`, matching the behavior of the\n  [JavaScript `encodeURIComponent` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent).\n- `quote(s)` - Replace all single quotes with `'\\''` and prepend and append\n  single quotes to `s`. This is sufficient to escape special characters for\n  many shells, including most Bourne shell descendants.\n- `replace(s, from, to)` - Replace all occurrences of `from` in `s` to `to`.\n- `replace_regex(s, regex, replacement)` - Replace all occurrences of `regex`\n  in `s` to `replacement`. Regular expressions are provided by the\n  [Rust `regex` crate](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/). See the\n  [syntax documentation](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax) for usage\n  examples. Capture groups are supported. The `replacement` string uses\n  [Replacement string syntax](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/struct.Regex.html#replacement-string-syntax).\n- `trim(s)` - Remove leading and trailing whitespace from `s`.\n- `trim_end(s)` - Remove trailing whitespace from `s`.\n- `trim_end_match(s, substring)` - Remove suffix of `s` matching `substring`.\n- `trim_end_matches(s, substring)` - Repeatedly remove suffixes of `s` matching\n  `substring`.\n- `trim_start(s)` - Remove leading whitespace from `s`.\n- `trim_start_match(s, substring)` - Remove prefix of `s` matching `substring`.\n- `trim_start_matches(s, substring)` - Repeatedly remove prefixes of `s`\n  matching `substring`.\n\n#### Case Conversion\n\n- `capitalize(s)`<sup>1.7.0</sup> - Convert first character of `s` to uppercase\n  and the rest to lowercase.\n- `kebabcase(s)`<sup>1.7.0</sup> - Convert `s` to `kebab-case`.\n- `lowercamelcase(s)`<sup>1.7.0</sup> - Convert `s` to `lowerCamelCase`.\n- `lowercase(s)` - Convert `s` to lowercase.\n- `shoutykebabcase(s)`<sup>1.7.0</sup> - Convert `s` to `SHOUTY-KEBAB-CASE`.\n- `shoutysnakecase(s)`<sup>1.7.0</sup> - Convert `s` to `SHOUTY_SNAKE_CASE`.\n- `snakecase(s)`<sup>1.7.0</sup> - Convert `s` to `snake_case`.\n- `titlecase(s)`<sup>1.7.0</sup> - Convert `s` to `Title Case`.\n- `uppercamelcase(s)`<sup>1.7.0</sup> - Convert `s` to `UpperCamelCase`.\n- `uppercase(s)` - Convert `s` to uppercase.\n\n#### Path Manipulation\n\n##### Fallible\n\n- `absolute_path(path)` - Absolute path to relative `path` in the working\n  directory. `absolute_path(\"./bar.txt\")` in directory `/foo` is\n  `/foo/bar.txt`.\n- `canonicalize(path)`<sup>1.24.0</sup> - Canonicalize `path` by resolving symlinks and removing\n  `.`, `..`, and extra `/`s where possible.\n- `extension(path)` - Extension of `path`. `extension(\"/foo/bar.txt\")` is\n  `txt`.\n- `file_name(path)` - File name of `path` with any leading directory components\n  removed. `file_name(\"/foo/bar.txt\")` is `bar.txt`.\n- `file_stem(path)` - File name of `path` without extension.\n  `file_stem(\"/foo/bar.txt\")` is `bar`.\n- `parent_directory(path)` - Parent directory of `path`.\n  `parent_directory(\"/foo/bar.txt\")` is `/foo`.\n- `without_extension(path)` - `path` without extension.\n  `without_extension(\"/foo/bar.txt\")` is `/foo/bar`.\n\nThese functions can fail, for example if a path does not have an extension,\nwhich will halt execution.\n\n##### Infallible\n\n- `clean(path)` - Simplify `path` by removing extra path separators,\n  intermediate `.` components, and `..` where possible. `clean(\"foo//bar\")` is\n  `foo/bar`, `clean(\"foo/..\")` is `.`, `clean(\"foo/./bar\")` is `foo/bar`.\n- `join(a, b…)` - *This function uses `/` on Unix and `\\` on Windows, which can\n  be lead to unwanted behavior. The `/` operator, e.g., `a / b`, which always\n  uses `/`, should be considered as a replacement unless `\\`s are specifically\n  desired on Windows.* Join path `a` with path `b`. `join(\"foo/bar\", \"baz\")` is\n  `foo/bar/baz`. Accepts two or more arguments.\n\n#### Filesystem Access\n\n- `path_exists(path)` - Returns `true` if the path points at an existing entity\n  and `false` otherwise. Traverses symbolic links, and returns `false` if the\n  path is inaccessible or points to a broken symlink.\n- `read(path)`<sup>1.39.0</sup> - Returns the content of file at `path` as\n  string.\n\n##### Error Reporting\n\n- `error(message)` - Abort execution and report error `message` to user.\n\n#### UUID and Hash Generation\n\n- `blake3(string)`<sup>1.25.0</sup> - Return [BLAKE3] hash of `string` as hexadecimal string.\n- `blake3_file(path)`<sup>1.25.0</sup> - Return [BLAKE3] hash of file at `path` as hexadecimal\n  string.\n- `sha256(string)` - Return the SHA-256 hash of `string` as hexadecimal string.\n- `sha256_file(path)` - Return SHA-256 hash of file at `path` as hexadecimal\n  string.\n- `uuid()` - Generate a random version 4 UUID.\n\n[BLAKE3]: https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/\n\n#### Random\n\n- `choose(n, alphabet)`<sup>1.27.0</sup> - Generate a string of `n` randomly\n  selected characters from `alphabet`, which may not contain repeated\n  characters. For example, `choose('64', HEX)` will generate a random\n  64-character lowercase hex string.\n\n#### Datetime\n\n- `datetime(format)`<sup>1.30.0</sup> - Return local time with `format`.\n- `datetime_utc(format)`<sup>1.30.0</sup> - Return UTC time with `format`.\n\nThe arguments to `datetime` and `datetime_utc` are `strftime`-style format\nstrings, see the\n[`chrono` library docs](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html)\nfor details.\n\n#### Semantic Versions\n\n- `semver_matches(version, requirement)`<sup>1.16.0</sup> - Check whether a\n  [semantic `version`](https://semver.org), e.g., `\"0.1.0\"` matches a\n  `requirement`, e.g., `\">=0.1.0\"`, returning `\"true\"` if so and `\"false\"`\n  otherwise.\n\n#### Style\n\n- `style(name)`<sup>1.37.0</sup> - Return a named terminal display attribute\n  escape sequence used by `just`. Unlike terminal display attribute escape\n  sequence constants, which contain standard colors and styles, `style(name)`\n  returns an escape sequence used by `just` itself, and can be used to make\n  recipe output match `just`'s own output.\n\n  Recognized values for `name` are `'command'`, for echoed recipe lines,\n  `error`, and `warning`.\n\n  For example, to style an error message:\n\n  ```just\n  scary:\n    @echo '{{ style(\"error\") }}OH NO{{ NORMAL }}'\n  ```\n\n##### User Directories<sup>1.23.0</sup>\n\nThese functions return paths to user-specific directories for things like\nconfiguration, data, caches, executables, and the user's home directory.\n\nOn Unix, these functions follow the\n[XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).\n\nOn MacOS and Windows, these functions return the system-specified user-specific\ndirectories. For example, `cache_directory()` returns `~/Library/Caches` on\nMacOS and `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}` on Windows.\n\nSee the [`dirs`](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/index.html) crate for more\ndetails.\n\n- `cache_directory()` - The user-specific cache directory.\n- `config_directory()` - The user-specific configuration directory.\n- `config_local_directory()` - The local user-specific configuration directory.\n- `data_directory()` - The user-specific data directory.\n- `data_local_directory()` - The local user-specific data directory.\n- `executable_directory()` - The user-specific executable directory.\n- `home_directory()` - The user's home directory.\n\nIf you would like to use XDG base directories on all platforms you can use the\n`env(…)` function with the appropriate environment variable and fallback,\nalthough note that the XDG specification requires ignoring non-absolute paths,\nso for full compatibility with spec-compliant applications, you would need to\ndo:\n\n```just\nxdg_config_dir := if env('XDG_CONFIG_HOME', '') =~ '^/' {\n  env('XDG_CONFIG_HOME')\n} else {\n  home_directory() / '.config'\n}\n```\n\n### Constants\n\nA number of constants are predefined:\n\n| Name | Value | Value on Windows |\n|---|---|---|\n| `HEX`<sup>1.27.0</sup> | `\"0123456789abcdef\"` |  |\n| `HEXLOWER`<sup>1.27.0</sup> | `\"0123456789abcdef\"` |  |\n| `HEXUPPER`<sup>1.27.0</sup> | `\"0123456789ABCDEF\"` |  |\n| `PATH_SEP`<sup>1.41.0</sup> | `\"/\"` | `\"\\\"` |\n| `PATH_VAR_SEP`<sup>1.41.0</sup> | `\":\"` | `\";\"` |\n| `CLEAR`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\ec\"` |  |\n| `NORMAL`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[0m\"` |  |\n| `BOLD`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[1m\"` |  |\n| `ITALIC`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[3m\"` |  |\n| `UNDERLINE`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[4m\"` |  |\n| `INVERT`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[7m\"` |  |\n| `HIDE`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[8m\"` |  |\n| `STRIKETHROUGH`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[9m\"` |  |\n| `BLACK`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[30m\"` |  |\n| `RED`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[31m\"` |  |\n| `GREEN`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[32m\"` |  |\n| `YELLOW`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[33m\"` |  |\n| `BLUE`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[34m\"` |  |\n| `MAGENTA`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[35m\"` |  |\n| `CYAN`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[36m\"` |  |\n| `WHITE`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[37m\"` |  |\n| `BG_BLACK`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[40m\"` |  |\n| `BG_RED`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[41m\"` |  |\n| `BG_GREEN`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[42m\"` |  |\n| `BG_YELLOW`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[43m\"` |  |\n| `BG_BLUE`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[44m\"` |  |\n| `BG_MAGENTA`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[45m\"` |  |\n| `BG_CYAN`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[46m\"` |  |\n| `BG_WHITE`<sup>1.37.0</sup> | `\"\\e[47m\"` |  |\n\n```just\n@foo:\n  echo {{HEX}}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just foo\n0123456789abcdef\n```\n\nConstants starting with `\\e` are\n[ANSI escape sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).\n\n`CLEAR` clears the screen, similar to the `clear` command. The rest are of the\nform `\\e[Nm`, where `N` is an integer, and set terminal display attributes.\n\nTerminal display attribute escape sequences can be combined, for example text\nweight `BOLD`, text style `STRIKETHROUGH`, foreground color `CYAN`, and\nbackground color `BG_BLUE`. They should be followed by `NORMAL`, to reset the\nterminal back to normal.\n\nEscape sequences should be quoted, since `[` is treated as a special character\nby some shells.\n\n```just\n@foo:\n  echo '{{BOLD + STRIKETHROUGH + CYAN + BG_BLUE}}Hi!{{NORMAL}}'\n```\n\n### Attributes\n\nRecipes, `mod` statements, and aliases may be annotated with attributes that\nchange their behavior.\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n|------|------|-------------|\n| `[arg(ARG, help=\"HELP\")]`<sup>1.46.0</sup> | recipe | Print help string `HELP` for `ARG` in usage messages. |\n| `[arg(ARG, long=\"LONG\")]`<sup>1.46.0</sup> | recipe | Require values of argument `ARG` to be passed as `--LONG` option. |\n| `[arg(ARG, short=\"S\")]`<sup>1.46.0</sup> | recipe | Require values of argument `ARG` to be passed as short `-S` option. |\n| `[arg(ARG, value=\"VALUE\")]`<sup>1.46.0</sup> | recipe | Makes option `ARG` a flag which does not take a value. |\n| `[arg(ARG, pattern=\"PATTERN\")]`<sup>1.45.0</sup> | recipe | Require values of argument `ARG` to match regular expression `PATTERN`. |\n| `[confirm]`<sup>1.17.0</sup> | recipe | Require confirmation prior to executing recipe. |\n| `[confirm(PROMPT)]`<sup>1.23.0</sup> | recipe | Require confirmation prior to executing recipe with a custom prompt. |\n| `[default]`<sup>1.43.0</sup> | recipe | Use recipe as module's default recipe. |\n| `[doc(DOC)]`<sup>1.27.0</sup> | module, recipe | Set recipe or module's [documentation comment](#documentation-comments) to `DOC`. |\n| `[extension(EXT)]`<sup>1.32.0</sup> | recipe | Set shebang recipe script's file extension to `EXT`. `EXT` should include a period if one is desired. |\n| `[group(NAME)]`<sup>1.27.0</sup> | module, recipe | Put recipe or module in in [group](#groups) `NAME`. |\n| `[linux]`<sup>1.8.0</sup> | recipe | Enable recipe on Linux. |\n| `[macos]`<sup>1.8.0</sup> | recipe | Enable recipe on MacOS. |\n| `[metadata(METADATA)]`<sup>1.42.0</sup> | recipe | Attach `METADATA` to recipe. |\n| `[no-cd]`<sup>1.9.0</sup> | recipe | Don't change directory before executing recipe. |\n| `[no-exit-message]`<sup>1.7.0</sup> | recipe | Don't print an error message if recipe fails. |\n| `[no-quiet]`<sup>1.23.0</sup> | recipe | Override globally quiet recipes and always echo out the recipe. |\n| `[openbsd]`<sup>1.38.0</sup> | recipe | Enable recipe on OpenBSD. |\n| `[parallel]`<sup>1.42.0</sup> | recipe | Run this recipe's dependencies in parallel. |\n| `[positional-arguments]`<sup>1.29.0</sup> | recipe | Turn on [positional arguments](#positional-arguments) for this recipe. |\n| `[private]`<sup>1.10.0</sup> | alias, recipe | Make recipe, alias, or variable private.

(Includes MacOS). |\n| `[windows]`<sup>1.8.0</sup> | recipe | Enable recipe on Windows. |\n| `[working-directory(PATH)]`<sup>1.38.0</sup> | recipe | Set recipe working directory. `PATH` may be relative or absolute. If relative, it is interpreted relative to the default working directory. |\n\nA recipe can have multiple attributes, either on multiple lines:\n\n```just\n[no-cd]\n[private]\nfoo:\n    echo \"foo\"\n```\n\nOr separated by commas on a single line<sup>1.14.0</sup>:\n\n```just\n[no-cd, private]\nfoo:\n    echo \"foo\"\n```\n\nAttributes with a single argument may be written with a colon:\n\n```just\n[group: 'bar']\nfoo:\n```\n\n#### Enabling and Disabling Recipes<sup>1.8.0</sup>\n\nThe `[linux]`, `[macos]`, `[unix]`, and `[windows]` attributes are\nconfiguration attributes. By default, recipes are always enabled. A recipe with\none or more configuration attributes will only be enabled when one or more of\nthose configurations is active.\n\nThis can be used to write `justfile`s that behave differently depending on\nwhich operating system they run on. The `run` recipe in this `justfile` will\ncompile and run `main.c`, using a different C compiler and using the correct\noutput binary name for that compiler depending on the operating system:\n\n```just\n[unix]\nrun:\n  cc main.c\n  ./a.out\n\n[windows]\nrun:\n  cl main.c\n  main.exe\n```\n\n#### Disabling Changing Directory<sup>1.9.0</sup>\n\n`just` normally executes recipes with the current directory set to the\ndirectory that contains the `justfile`. This can be disabled using the\n`[no-cd]` attribute. This can be used to create recipes which use paths\nrelative to the invocation directory, or which operate on the current\ndirectory.\n\nFor example, this `commit` recipe:\n\n```just\n[no-cd]\ncommit file:\n  git add {{file}}\n  git commit\n```\n\nCan be used with paths that are relative to the current directory, because\n`[no-cd]` prevents `just` from changing the current directory when executing\n`commit`.\n\n#### Requiring Confirmation for Recipes<sup>1.17.0</sup>\n\n`just` normally executes all recipes unless there is an error. The `[confirm]`\nattribute allows recipes require confirmation in the terminal prior to running.\nThis can be overridden by passing `--yes` to `just`, which will automatically\nconfirm any recipes marked by this attribute.\n\nRecipes dependent on a recipe that requires confirmation will not be run if the\nrelied upon recipe is not confirmed, as well as recipes passed after any recipe\nthat requires confirmation.\n\n```just\n[confirm]\ndelete-all:\n  rm -rf *\n```\n\n#### Custom Confirmation Prompt<sup>1.23.0</sup>\n\nThe default confirmation prompt can be overridden with `[confirm(PROMPT)]`:\n\n```just\n[confirm(\"Are you sure you want to delete everything?\")]\ndelete-everything:\n  rm -rf *\n```\n\n### Groups\n\nRecipes and modules may be annotated with one or more group names:\n\n```just\n[group('lint')]\njs-lint:\n    echo 'Running JS linter…'\n\n[group('rust recipes')]\n[group('lint')]\nrust-lint:\n    echo 'Running Rust linter…'\n\n[group('lint')]\ncpp-lint:\n  echo 'Running C++ linter…'\n\n# not in any group\nemail-everyone:\n    echo 'Sending mass email…'\n```\n\nRecipes are listed by group:\n\n```\n$ just --list\nAvailable recipes:\n    email-everyone # not in any group\n\n    [lint]\n    cpp-lint\n    js-lint\n    rust-lint\n\n    [rust recipes]\n    rust-lint\n```\n\n`just --list --unsorted` prints recipes in their justfile order within each group:\n\n```\n$ just --list --unsorted\nAvailable recipes:\n    (no group)\n    email-everyone # not in any group\n\n    [lint]\n    js-lint\n    rust-lint\n    cpp-lint\n\n    [rust recipes]\n    rust-lint\n```\n\nGroups can be listed with `--groups`:\n\n```\n$ just --groups\nRecipe groups:\n  lint\n  rust recipes\n```\n\nUse `just --groups --unsorted` to print groups in their justfile order.\n\n### Command Evaluation Using Backticks\n\nBackticks can be used to store the result of commands:\n\n```just\nlocalhost := `dumpinterfaces | cut -d: -f2 | sed 's/\\/.*//' | sed 's/ //g'`\n\nserve:\n  ./serve {{localhost}} 8080\n```\n\nIndented backticks, delimited by three backticks, are de-indented in the same\nmanner as indented strings:\n\n````just\n# This backtick evaluates the command `echo foo\\necho bar\\n`, which produces the value `foo\\nbar\\n`.\nstuff := ```\n    echo foo\n    echo bar\n  ```\n````\n\nSee the [Strings](#strings) section for details on unindenting.\n\nBackticks may not start with `#!`. This syntax is reserved for a future\nupgrade.\n\nThe [`shell(…)` function](#external-commands) provides a more general mechanism\nto invoke external commands, including the ability to execute the contents of a\nvariable as a command, and to pass arguments to a command.\n\n### Conditional Expressions\n\n`if`/`else` expressions evaluate different branches depending on if two\nexpressions evaluate to the same value:\n\n```just\nfoo := if \"2\" == \"2\" { \"Good!\" } else { \"1984\" }\n\nbar:\n  @echo \"{{foo}}\"\n```\n\n```console\n$ just bar\nGood!\n```\n\nIt is also possible to test for inequality:\n\n```just\nfoo := if \"hello\" != \"goodbye\" { \"xyz\" } else { \"abc\" }\n\nbar:\n  @echo {{foo}}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just bar\nxyz\n```\n\nAnd match against regular expressions:\n\n```just\nfoo := if \"hello\" =~ 'hel+o' { \"match\" } else { \"mismatch\" }\n\nbar:\n  @echo {{foo}}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just bar\nmatch\n```\n\nRegular expressions are provided by the\n[regex crate](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex), whose syntax is documented on\n[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/#syntax). Since regular expressions\ncommonly use backslash escape sequences, consider using single-quoted string\nliterals, which will pass slashes to the regex parser unmolested.\n\nConditional expressions short-circuit, which means they only evaluate one of\ntheir branches. This can be used to make sure that backtick expressions don't\nrun when they shouldn't.\n\n```just\nfoo := if env_var(\"RELEASE\") == \"true\" { `get-something-from-release-database` } else { \"dummy-value\" }\n```\n\nConditionals can be used inside of recipes:\n\n```just\nbar foo:\n  echo {{ if foo == \"bar\" { \"hello\" } else { \"goodbye\" } }}\n```\n\nMultiple conditionals can be chained:\n\n```just\nfoo := if \"hello\" == \"goodbye\" {\n  \"xyz\"\n} else if \"a\" == \"a\" {\n  \"abc\"\n} else {\n  \"123\"\n}\n\nbar:\n  @echo {{foo}}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just bar\nabc\n```\n\n### Stopping execution with error\n\nExecution can be halted with the `error` function. For example:\n\n```just\nfoo := if \"hello\" == \"goodbye\" {\n  \"xyz\"\n} else if \"a\" == \"b\" {\n  \"abc\"\n} else {\n  error(\"123\")\n}\n```\n\nWhich produce the following error when run:\n\n```\nerror: Call to function `error` failed: 123\n   |\n16 |   error(\"123\")\n```\n\n### Setting Variables from the Command Line\n\nVariables can be overridden from the command line.\n\n```just\nos := \"linux\"\n\ntest: build\n  ./test --test {{os}}\n\nbuild:\n  ./build {{os}}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just\n./build linux\n./test --test linux\n```\n\nAny number of arguments of the form `NAME=VALUE` can be passed before recipes:\n\n```console\n$ just os=plan9\n./build plan9\n./test --test plan9\n```\n\nOr you can use the `--set` flag:\n\n```console\n$ just --set os bsd\n./build bsd\n./test --test bsd\n```\n\n### Getting and Setting Environment Variables\n\n#### Exporting `just` Variables\n\nAssignments prefixed with the `export` keyword will be exported to recipes as\nenvironment variables:\n\n```just\nexport RUST_BACKTRACE := \"1\"\n\ntest:\n  # will print a stack trace if it crashes\n  cargo test\n```\n\nParameters prefixed with a `$` will be exported as environment variables:\n\n```just\ntest $RUST_BACKTRACE=\"1\":\n  # will print a stack trace if it crashes\n  cargo test\n```\n\nExported variables and parameters are not exported to backticks in the same scope.\n\n```just\nexport WORLD := \"world\"\n# This backtick will fail with \"WORLD: unbound variable\"\nBAR := `echo hello $WORLD`\n```\n\n```just\n# Running `just a foo` will fail with \"A: unbound variable\"\na $A $B=`echo $A`:\n  echo $A $B\n```\n\nWhen [export](#export) is set, all `just` variables are exported as environment\nvariables.\n\n#### Unexporting Environment Variables<sup>1.29.0</sup>\n\nEnvironment variables can be unexported with the `unexport keyword`:\n\n```just\nunexport FOO\n\n@foo:\n  echo $FOO\n```\n\n```\n$ export FOO=bar\n$ just foo\nsh: FOO: unbound variable\n```\n\n#### Getting Environment Variables from the environment\n\nEnvironment variables from the environment are passed automatically to the\nrecipes.\n\n```just\nprint_home_folder:\n  echo \"HOME is: '${HOME}'\"\n```\n\n```console\n$ just\nHOME is '/home/myuser'\n```\n\n#### Setting `just` Variables from Environment Variables\n\nEnvironment variables can be propagated to `just` variables using the `env()` function.\nSee\n[environment-variables](#environment-variables).\n\n### Recipe Parameters\n\nRecipes may have parameters. Here recipe `build` has a parameter called\n`target`:\n\n```just\nbuild target:\n  @echo 'Building {{target}}…'\n  cd {{target}} && make\n```\n\nTo pass arguments on the command line, put them after the recipe name:\n\n```console\n$ just build my-awesome-project\nBuilding my-awesome-project…\ncd my-awesome-project && make\n```\n\nTo pass arguments to a dependency, put the dependency in parentheses along with\nthe arguments:\n\n```just\ndefault: (build \"main\")\n\nbuild target:\n  @echo 'Building {{target}}…'\n  cd {{target}} && make\n```\n\nVariables can also be passed as arguments to dependencies:\n\n```just\ntarget := \"main\"\n\n_build version:\n  @echo 'Building {{version}}…'\n  cd {{version}} && make\n\nbuild: (_build target)\n```\n\nA command's arguments can be passed to dependency by putting the dependency in\nparentheses along with the arguments:\n\n```just\nbuild target:\n  @echo \"Building {{target}}…\"\n\npush target: (build target)\n  @echo 'Pushing {{target}}…'\n```\n\nParameters may have default values:\n\n```just\ndefault := 'all'\n\ntest target tests=default:\n  @echo 'Testing {{target}}:{{tests}}…'\n  ./test --tests {{tests}} {{target}}\n```\n\nParameters with default values may be omitted:\n\n```console\n$ just test server\nTesting server:all…\n./test --tests all server\n```\n\nOr supplied:\n\n```console\n$ just test server unit\nTesting server:unit…\n./test --tests unit server\n```\n\nDefault values may be arbitrary expressions, but expressions containing the\n`+`, `&&`, `||`, or `/` operators must be parenthesized:\n\n```just\narch := \"wasm\"\n\ntest triple=(arch + \"-unknown-unknown\") input=(arch / \"input.dat\"):\n  ./test {{triple}}\n```\n\nThe last parameter of a recipe may be variadic, indicated with either a `+` or\na `*` before the argument name:\n\n```just\nbackup +FILES:\n  scp {{FILES}} me@server.com:\n```\n\nVariadic parameters prefixed with `+` accept _one or more_ arguments and expand\nto a string containing those arguments separated by spaces:\n\n```console\n$ just backup FAQ.md GRAMMAR.md\nscp FAQ.md GRAMMAR.md me@server.com:\nFAQ.md                  100% 1831     1.8KB/s   00:00\nGRAMMAR.md              100% 1666     1.6KB/s   00:00\n```\n\nVariadic parameters prefixed with `*` accept _zero or more_ arguments and\nexpand to a string containing those arguments separated by spaces, or an empty\nstring if no arguments are present:\n\n```just\ncommit MESSAGE *FLAGS:\n  git commit {{FLAGS}} -m \"{{MESSAGE}}\"\n```\n\nVariadic parameters can be assigned default values. These are overridden by\narguments passed on the command line:\n\n```just\ntest +FLAGS='-q':\n  cargo test {{FLAGS}}\n```\n\n`{{…}}` substitutions may need to be quoted if they contain spaces. For\nexample, if you have the following recipe:\n\n```just\nsearch QUERY:\n  lynx https://www.google.com/?q={{QUERY}}\n```\n\nAnd you type:\n\n```console\n$ just search \"cat toupee\"\n```\n\n`just` will run the command `lynx https://www.google.com/?q=cat toupee`, which\nwill get parsed by `sh` as `lynx`, `https://www.google.com/?q=cat`, and\n`toupee`, and not the intended `lynx` and `https://www.google.com/?q=cat toupee`.\n\nYou can fix this by adding quotes:\n\n```just\nsearch QUERY:\n  lynx 'https://www.google.com/?q={{QUERY}}'\n```\n\nParameters prefixed with a `$` will be exported as environment variables:\n\n```just\nfoo $bar:\n  echo $bar\n```\n\nParameters may be constrained to match regular expression patterns using the\n`[arg(\"name\", pattern=\"pattern\")]` attribute<sup>1.45.0</sup>:\n\n```just\n[arg('n', pattern='\\d+')]\ndouble n:\n  echo $(({{n}} * 2))\n```\n\nA leading `^` and trailing `$` are added to the pattern, so it must match the\nentire argument value.\n\nYou may constrain the pattern to a number of alternatives using the `|`\noperator:\n\n```just\n[arg('flag', pattern='--help|--version')]\ninfo flag:\n  just {{flag}}\n```\n\nRegular expressions are provided by the\n[Rust `regex` crate](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/). See the\n[syntax documentation](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax) for usage\nexamples.\n\nUsage information for a recipe may be printed with the `--usage`\nsubcommand<sup>1.46.0</sup>:\n\n```console\n$ just --usage foo\nUsage: just foo [OPTIONS] bar\n\nArguments:\n  bar\n```\n\nHelp strings may be added to arguments using the `[arg(ARG, help=HELP)]` attribute:\n\n```just\n[arg(\"bar\", help=\"hello\")]\nfoo bar:\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --usage foo\nUsage: just foo bar\n\nArguments:\n  bar hello\n```\n\n#### Recipe Flags and Options\n\nRecipe parameters are positional by default.\n\nIn this `justfile`:\n\n```just\n@foo bar:\n  echo bar={{bar}}\n```\n\nThe parameter `bar` is positional:\n\n```console\n$ just foo hello\nbar=hello\n```\n\nThe `[arg(ARG, long=OPTION)]`<sup>1.46.0</sup> attribute can be used to make a\nparameter a long option.\n\nIn this `justfile`:\n\n```just\n[arg(\"bar\", long=\"bar\")]\nfoo bar:\n```\n\nThe parameter `bar` is given with the `--bar` option:\n\n```console\n$ just foo --bar hello\nbar=hello\n```\n\nOptions may also be passed with `--name=value` syntax:\n\n```console\n$ just foo --bar=hello\nbar=hello\n```\n\nThe value of `long` can be omitted, in which case the option defaults to the\nname of the parameter:\n\n```just\n[arg(\"bar\", long)]\nfoo bar:\n```\n\nThe `[arg(ARG, short=OPTION)]`<sup>1.46.0</sup> attribute can be used to make a\nparameter a short option.\n\nIn this `justfile`:\n\n```just\n[arg(\"bar\", short=\"b\")]\nfoo bar:\n```\n\nThe parameter `bar` is given with the `-b` option:\n\n```console\n$ just foo -b hello\nbar=hello\n```\n\nIf a parameter has both a long and short option, it may be passed using either.\n\nVariadic `+` and `?` parameters cannot be options.\n\nThe `[arg(ARG, value=VALUE, …)]`<sup>1.46.0</sup> attribute can be used with\n`long` or `short` to make a parameter a flag which does not take a value.\n\nIn this `justfile`:\n\n```just\n[arg(\"bar\", long=\"bar\", value=\"hello\")]\nfoo bar:\n```\n\nThe parameter `bar` is given with the `--bar` option, but does not take a\nvalue, and instead takes the value given in the `[arg]` attribute:\n\n```console\n$ just foo --bar\nbar=hello\n```\n\nThis is useful for unconditionally requiring a flag like `--force` on dangerous\ncommands.\n\nA flag is optional if its parameter has a default:\n\n```just\n[arg(\"bar\", long=\"bar\", value=\"hello\")]\nfoo bar=\"goodbye\":\n```\n\nCausing it to receive the default when not passed in the invocation:\n\n```console\n$ just foo\nbar=goodbye\n```\n\n### Dependencies\n\nDependencies run before recipes that depend on them:\n\n```just\na: b\n  @echo A\n\nb:\n  @echo B\n```\n\n```\n$ just a\nB\nA\n```\n\nIn a given invocation of `just`, a recipe with the same arguments will only run\nonce, regardless of how many times it appears in the command-line invocation,\nor how many times it appears as a dependency:\n\n```just\na:\n  @echo A\n\nb: a\n  @echo B\n\nc: a\n  @echo C\n```\n\n```\n$ just a a a a a\nA\n$ just b c\nA\nB\nC\n```\n\nMultiple recipes may depend on a recipe that performs some kind of setup, and\nwhen those recipes run, that setup will only be performed once:\n\n```just\nbuild:\n  cc main.c\n\ntest-foo: build\n  ./a.out --test foo\n\ntest-bar: build\n  ./a.out --test bar\n```\n\n```\n$ just test-foo test-bar\ncc main.c\n./a.out --test foo\n./a.out --test bar\n```\n\nRecipes in a given run are only skipped when they receive the same arguments:\n\n```just\nbuild:\n  cc main.c\n\ntest TEST: build\n  ./a.out --test {{TEST}}\n```\n\n```\n$ just test foo test bar\ncc main.c\n./a.out --test foo\n./a.out --test bar\n```\n\n#### Running Recipes at the End of a Recipe\n\nNormal dependencies of a recipes always run before a recipe starts. That is to\nsay, the dependee always runs before the depender. These dependencies are\ncalled \"prior dependencies\".\n\nA recipe can also have subsequent dependencies, which run immediately after the\nrecipe and are introduced with an `&&`:\n\n```just\na:\n  echo 'A!'\n\nb: a && c d\n  echo 'B!'\n\nc:\n  echo 'C!'\n\nd:\n  echo 'D!'\n```\n\n…running _b_ prints:\n\n```console\n$ just b\necho 'A!'\nA!\necho 'B!'\nB!\necho 'C!'\nC!\necho 'D!'\nD!\n```\n\n#### Running Recipes in the Middle of a Recipe\n\n`just` doesn't support running recipes in the middle of another recipe, but you\ncan call `just` recursively in the middle of a recipe. Given the following\n`justfile`:\n\n```just\na:\n  echo 'A!'\n\nb: a\n  echo 'B start!'\n  just c\n  echo 'B end!'\n\nc:\n  echo 'C!'\n```\n\n…running _b_ prints:\n\n```console\n$ just b\necho 'A!'\nA!\necho 'B start!'\nB start!\necho 'C!'\nC!\necho 'B end!'\nB end!\n```\n\nThis has limitations, since recipe `c` is run with an entirely new invocation\nof `just`: Assignments will be recalculated, dependencies might run twice, and\ncommand line arguments will not be propagated to the child `just` process.\n\n### Shebang Recipes\n\nRecipes that start with `#!` are called shebang recipes, and are executed by\nsaving the recipe body to a file and running it. This lets you write recipes in\ndifferent languages:\n\n```just\npolyglot: python js perl sh ruby nu\n\npython:\n  #!/usr/bin/env python3\n  print('Hello from python!')\n\njs:\n  #!/usr/bin/env node\n  console.log('Greetings from JavaScript!')\n\nperl:\n  #!/usr/bin/env perl\n  print \"Larry Wall says Hi!\\n\";\n\nsh:\n  #!/usr/bin/env sh\n  hello='Yo'\n  echo \"$hello from a shell script!\"\n\nnu:\n  #!/usr/bin/env nu\n  let hello = 'Hola'\n  echo $\"($hello) from a nushell script!\"\n\nruby:\n  #!/usr/bin/env ruby\n  puts \"Hello from ruby!\"\n```\n\n```console\n$ just polyglot\nHello from python!\nGreetings from JavaScript!\nLarry Wall says Hi!\nYo from a shell script!\nHola from a nushell script!\nHello from ruby!\n```\n\nOn Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and MacOS, shebang recipes are\nexecuted by saving the recipe body to a file in a temporary directory, marking\nthe file as executable, and executing it. The OS then parses the shebang line\ninto a command line and invokes it, including the path to the file. For\nexample, if a recipe starts with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, the final command that\nthe OS runs will be something like `/usr/bin/env bash\n/tmp/PATH_TO_SAVED_RECIPE_BODY`.\n\nShebang line splitting is operating system dependent. When passing a command\nwith arguments, you may need to tell `env` to split them explicitly by using\nthe `-S` flag:\n\n```just\nrun:\n  #!/usr/bin/env -S bash -x\n  ls\n```\n\nWindows does not support shebang lines. On Windows, `just` splits the shebang\nline into a command and arguments, saves the recipe body to a file, and invokes\nthe split command and arguments, adding the path to the saved recipe body as\nthe final argument. For example, on Windows, if a recipe starts with `#! py`,\nthe final command the OS runs will be something like\n`py C:\\Temp\\PATH_TO_SAVED_RECIPE_BODY`.\n\n### Script Recipes\n\nRecipes with a `[script(COMMAND)]`<sup>1.32.0</sup> attribute are run as\nscripts interpreted by `COMMAND`. This avoids some of the issues with shebang\nrecipes, such as the use of `cygpath` on Windows, the need to use\n`/usr/bin/env`, inconsistencies in shebang line splitting across Unix OSs, and\nrequiring a temporary directory from which files can be executed.\n\nRecipes with an empty `[script]` attribute are executed with the value of `set\nscript-interpreter := […]`<sup>1.33.0</sup>, defaulting to `sh -eu`, and *not*\nthe value of `set shell`.\n\nThe body of the recipe is evaluated, written to disk in the temporary\ndirectory, and run by passing its path as an argument to `COMMAND`.\n\n### Script and Shebang Recipe Temporary Files\n\nBoth script and shebang recipes write the recipe body to a temporary file for\nexecution. Script recipes execute that file by passing it to a command, while\nshebang recipes execute the file directly. Shebang recipe execution will fail\nif the filesystem containing the temporary file is mounted with `noexec` or is\notherwise non-executable.\n\nThe directory that `just` writes temporary files to may be configured in a\nnumber of ways, from highest to lowest precedence:\n\n- Globally with the `--tempdir` command-line option or the `JUST_TEMPDIR`\n  environment variable<sup>1.41.0</sup>.\n\n- On a per-module basis with the `tempdir` setting.\n\n- Globally on Linux with the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` environment variable.\n\n- Falling back to the directory returned by\n  [std::env::temp_dir](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.temp_dir.html).\n\n### Python Recipes with `uv`\n\n[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is an excellent cross-platform python\nproject manager, written in Rust.\n\nUsing the `[script]` attribute and `script-interpreter` setting, `just` can\neasily be configured to run Python recipes with `uv`:\n\n```just\nset unstable\n\nset script-interpreter := ['uv', 'run', '--script']\n\n[script]\nhello:\n  print(\"Hello from Python!\")\n\n[script]\ngoodbye:\n  # /// script\n  # requires-python = \">=3.11\"\n  # dependencies=[\"sh\"]\n  # ///\n  import sh\n  print(sh.echo(\"Goodbye from Python!\"), end='')\n```\n\nOf course, a shebang also works:\n\n```just\nhello:\n  #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script\n  print(\"Hello from Python!\")\n```\n\n\n### Safer Bash Shebang Recipes\n\nIf you're writing a `bash` shebang recipe, consider adding `set -euxo\npipefail`:\n\n```just\nfoo:\n  #!/usr/bin/env bash\n  set -euxo pipefail\n  hello='Yo'\n  echo \"$hello from Bash!\"\n```\n\nIt isn't strictly necessary, but `set -euxo pipefail` turns on a few useful\nfeatures that make `bash` shebang recipes behave more like normal, linewise\n`just` recipe:\n\n- `set -e` makes `bash` exit if a command fails.\n\n- `set -u` makes `bash` exit if a variable is undefined.\n\n- `set -x` makes `bash` print each script line before it's run.\n\n- `set -o pipefail` makes `bash` exit if a command in a pipeline fails. This is\n  `bash`-specific, so isn't turned on in normal linewise `just` recipes.\n\nTogether, these avoid a lot of shell scripting gotchas.\n\n#### Shebang Recipe Execution on Windows\n\nOn Windows, shebang interpreter paths containing a `/` are translated from\nUnix-style paths to Windows-style paths using `cygpath`, a utility that ships\nwith [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com).\n\nFor example, to execute this recipe on Windows:\n\n```just\necho:\n  #!/bin/sh\n  echo \"Hello!\"\n```\n\nThe interpreter path `/bin/sh` will be translated to a Windows-style path using\n`cygpath` before being executed.\n\nIf the interpreter path does not contain a `/` it will be executed without\nbeing translated. This is useful if `cygpath` is not available, or you wish to\npass a Windows-style path to the interpreter.\n\n### Setting Variables in a Recipe\n\nRecipe lines are interpreted by the shell, not `just`, so it's not possible to\nset `just` variables in the middle of a recipe:\n\n```justfile\nfoo:\n  x := \"hello\" # This doesn't work!\n  echo {{x}}\n```\n\nIt is possible to use shell variables, but there's another problem. Every\nrecipe line is run by a new shell instance, so variables set in one line won't\nbe set in the next:\n\n```just\nfoo:\n  x=hello && echo $x # This works!\n  y=bye\n  echo $y            # This doesn't, `y` is undefined here!\n```\n\nThe best way to work around this is to use a shebang recipe. Shebang recipe\nbodies are extracted and run as scripts, so a single shell instance will run\nthe whole thing:\n\n```just\nfoo:\n  #!/usr/bin/env bash\n  set -euxo pipefail\n  x=hello\n  echo $x\n```\n\n### Sharing Environment Variables Between Recipes\n\nEach line of each recipe is executed by a fresh shell, so it is not possible to\nshare environment variables between recipes.\n\n#### Using Python Virtual Environments\n\nSome tools, like [Python's venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html),\nrequire loading environment variables in order to work, making them challenging\nto use with `just`. As a workaround, you can execute the virtual environment\nbinaries directly:\n\n```just\nvenv:\n  [ -d foo ] || python3 -m venv foo\n\nrun: venv\n  ./foo/bin/python3 main.py\n```\n\n### Changing the Working Directory in a Recipe\n\nEach recipe line is executed by a new shell, so if you change the working\ndirectory on one line, it won't have an effect on later lines:\n\n```just\nfoo:\n  pwd    # This `pwd` will print the same directory…\n  cd bar\n  pwd    # …as this `pwd`!\n```\n\nThere are a couple ways around this. One is to call `cd` on the same line as\nthe command you want to run:\n\n```just\nfoo:\n  cd bar && pwd\n```\n\nThe other is to use a shebang recipe. Shebang recipe bodies are extracted and\nrun as scripts, so a single shell instance will run the whole thing, and thus a\n`cd` on one line will affect later lines, just like a shell script:\n\n```just\nfoo:\n  #!/usr/bin/env bash\n  set -euxo pipefail\n  cd bar\n  pwd\n```\n\n### Indentation\n\nRecipe lines can be indented with spaces or tabs, but not a mix of both. All of\na recipe's lines must have the same type of indentation, but different recipes\nin the same `justfile` may use different indentation.\n\nEach recipe must be indented at least one level from the `recipe-name` but\nafter that may be further indented.\n\nHere's a justfile with a recipe indented with spaces, represented as `·`, and\ntabs, represented as `→`.\n\n```justfile\nset windows-shell := [\"pwsh\", \"-NoLogo\", \"-NoProfileLoadTime\", \"-Command\"]\n\nset ignore-comments\n\nlist-space directory:\n··#!pwsh\n··foreach ($item in $(Get-ChildItem {{directory}} )) {\n····echo $item.Name\n··}\n··echo \"\"\n\n# indentation nesting works even when newlines are escaped\nlist-tab directory:\n→ @foreach ($item in $(Get-ChildItem {{directory}} )) { \\\n→ → echo $item.Name \\\n→ }\n→ @echo \"\"\n```\n\n```pwsh\nPS > just list-space ~\nDesktop\nDocuments\nDownloads\n\nPS > just list-tab ~\nDesktop\nDocuments\nDownloads\n```\n\n### Multi-Line Constructs\n\nRecipes without an initial shebang are evaluated and run line-by-line, which\nmeans that multi-line constructs probably won't do what you want.\n\nFor example, with the following `justfile`:\n\n```justfile\nconditional:\n  if true; then\n    echo 'True!'\n  fi\n```\n\nThe extra leading whitespace before the second line of the `conditional` recipe\nwill produce a parse error:\n\n```console\n$ just conditional\nerror: Recipe line has extra leading whitespace\n  |\n3 |         echo 'True!'\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n```\n\nTo work around this, you can write conditionals on one line, escape newlines\nwith slashes, or add a shebang to your recipe. Some examples of multi-line\nconstructs are provided for reference.\n\n#### `if` statements\n\n```just\nconditional:\n  if true; then echo 'True!'; fi\n```\n\n```just\nconditional:\n  if true; then \\\n    echo 'True!'; \\\n  fi\n```\n\n```just\nconditional:\n  #!/usr/bin/env sh\n  if true; then\n    echo 'True!'\n  fi\n```\n\n#### `for` loops\n\n```just\nfor:\n  for file in `ls .`; do echo $file; done\n```\n\n```just\nfor:\n  for file in `ls .`; do \\\n    echo $file; \\\n  done\n```\n\n```just\nfor:\n  #!/usr/bin/env sh\n  for file in `ls .`; do\n    echo $file\n  done\n```\n\n#### `while` loops\n\n```just\nwhile:\n  while `server-is-dead`; do ping -c 1 server; done\n```\n\n```just\nwhile:\n  while `server-is-dead`; do \\\n    ping -c 1 server; \\\n  done\n```\n\n```just\nwhile:\n  #!/usr/bin/env sh\n  while `server-is-dead`; do\n    ping -c 1 server\n  done\n```\n\n#### Outside Recipe Bodies\n\nParenthesized expressions can span multiple lines:\n\n```just\nabc := ('a' +\n        'b'\n         + 'c')\n\nabc2 := (\n  'a' +\n  'b' +\n  'c'\n)\n\nfoo param=('foo'\n      + 'bar'\n    ):\n  echo {{param}}\n\nbar: (foo\n        'Foo'\n     )\n  echo 'Bar!'\n```\n\nLines ending with a backslash continue on to the next line as if the lines were\njoined by whitespace<sup>1.15.0</sup>:\n\n```just\na := 'foo' + \\\n     'bar'\n\nfoo param1 \\\n  param2='foo' \\\n  *varparam='': dep1 \\\n                (dep2 'foo')\n  echo {{param1}} {{param2}} {{varparam}}\n\ndep1: \\\n    # this comment is not part of the recipe body\n  echo 'dep1'\n\ndep2 \\\n  param:\n    echo 'Dependency with parameter {{param}}'\n```\n\nBackslash line continuations can also be used in interpolations. The line\nfollowing the backslash must be indented.\n\n```just\nrecipe:\n  echo '{{ \\\n  \"This interpolation \" + \\\n    \"has a lot of text.\" \\\n  }}'\n  echo 'back to recipe body'\n```\n\n### Command-line Options\n\n`just` supports a number of useful command-line options for listing, dumping,\nand debugging recipes and variables:\n\n```console\n$ just --list\nAvailable recipes:\n  js\n  perl\n  polyglot\n  python\n  ruby\n$ just --show perl\nperl:\n  #!/usr/bin/env perl\n  print \"Larry Wall says Hi!\\n\";\n$ just --show polyglot\npolyglot: python js perl sh ruby\n```\n\n#### Setting Command-line Options with Environment Variables\n\nSome command-line options can be set with environment variables\n\nFor example, unstable features can be enabled either with the `--unstable`\nflag:\n\n```console\n$ just --unstable\n```\n\nOr by setting the `JUST_UNSTABLE` environment variable:\n\n```console\n$ export JUST_UNSTABLE=1\n$ just\n```\n\nSince environment variables are inherited by child processes, command-line\noptions set with environment variables are inherited by recursive invocations\nof `just`, where as command line options set with arguments are not.\n\nConsult `just --help` for which options can be set with environment variables.\n\n### Private Recipes\n\nRecipes and aliases whose name starts with a `_` are omitted from `just --list`:\n\n```just\ntest: _test-helper\n  ./bin/test\n\n_test-helper:\n  ./bin/super-secret-test-helper-stuff\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --list\nAvailable recipes:\n    test\n```\n\nAnd from `just --summary`:\n\n```console\n$ just --summary\ntest\n```\n\nThe `[private]` attribute<sup>1.10.0</sup> may also be used to hide recipes or\naliases without needing to change the name:\n\n```just\n[private]\nfoo:\n\n[private]\nalias b := bar\n\nbar:\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --list\nAvailable recipes:\n    bar\n```\n\nThis is useful for helper recipes which are only meant to be used as\ndependencies of other recipes.\n\n### Quiet Recipes\n\nA recipe name may be prefixed with `@` to invert the meaning of `@` before each\nline:\n\n```just\n@quiet:\n  echo hello\n  echo goodbye\n  @# all done!\n```\n\nNow only the lines starting with `@` will be echoed:\n\n```console\n$ just quiet\nhello\ngoodbye\n# all done!\n```\n\nAll recipes in a Justfile can be made quiet with `set quiet`:\n\n```just\nset quiet\n\nfoo:\n  echo \"This is quiet\"\n\n@foo2:\n  echo \"This is also quiet\"\n```\n\nThe `[no-quiet]` attribute overrides this setting:\n\n```just\nset quiet\n\nfoo:\n  echo \"This is quiet\"\n\n[no-quiet]\nfoo2:\n  echo \"This is not quiet\"\n```\n\nShebang recipes are quiet by default:\n\n```just\nfoo:\n  #!/usr/bin/env bash\n  echo 'Foo!'\n```\n\n```console\n$ just foo\nFoo!\n```\n\nAdding `@` to a shebang recipe name makes `just` print the recipe before\nexecuting it:\n\n```just\n@bar:\n  #!/usr/bin/env bash\n  echo 'Bar!'\n```\n\n```console\n$ just bar\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\necho 'Bar!'\nBar!\n```\n\n`just` normally prints error messages when a recipe line fails. These error\nmessages can be suppressed using the `[no-exit-message]`<sup>1.7.0</sup>\nattribute. You may find this especially useful with a recipe that wraps a tool:\n\n```just\ngit *args:\n    @git {{args}}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just git status\nfatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\nerror: Recipe `git` failed on line 2 with exit code 128\n```\n\nAdd the attribute to suppress the exit error message when the tool exits with a\nnon-zero code:\n\n```just\n[no-exit-message]\ngit *args:\n    @git {{args}}\n```\n\n```console\n$ just git status\nfatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\n```\n\n### Selecting Recipes to Run With an Interactive Chooser\n\nThe `--choose` subcommand makes `just` invoke a chooser to select which recipes\nto run. Choosers should read lines containing recipe names from standard input\nand print one or more of those names separated by spaces to standard output.\n\nBecause there is currently no way to run a recipe that requires arguments with\n`--choose`, such recipes will not be given to the chooser. Private recipes and\naliases are also skipped.\n\nThe chooser can be overridden with the `--chooser` flag. If `--chooser` is not\ngiven, then `just` first checks if `$JUST_CHOOSER` is set. If it isn't, then\nthe chooser defaults to `fzf`, a popular fuzzy finder.\n\nArguments can be included in the chooser, i.e. `fzf --exact`.\n\nThe chooser is invoked in the same way as recipe lines. For example, if the\nchooser is `fzf`, it will be invoked with `sh -cu 'fzf'`, and if the shell, or\nthe shell arguments are overridden, the chooser invocation will respect those\noverrides.\n\nIf you'd like `just` to default to selecting recipes with a chooser, you can\nuse this as your default recipe:\n\n```just\ndefault:\n  @just --choose\n```\n\n### Invoking `justfile`s in Other Directories\n\nIf the first argument passed to `just` contains a `/`, then the following\noccurs:\n\n1.  The argument is split at the last `/`.\n\n2.  The part before the last `/` is treated as a directory. `just` will start\n    its search for the `justfile` there, instead of in the current directory.\n\n3.  The part after the last slash is treated as a normal argument, or ignored\n    if it is empty.\n\nThis may seem a little strange, but it's useful if you wish to run a command in\na `justfile` that is in a subdirectory.\n\nFor example, if you are in a directory which contains a subdirectory named\n`foo`, which contains a `justfile` with the recipe `build`, which is also the\ndefault recipe, the following are all equivalent:\n\n```console\n$ (cd foo && just build)\n$ just foo/build\n$ just foo/\n```\n\nAdditional recipes after the first are sought in the same `justfile`. For\nexample, the following are both equivalent:\n\n```console\n$ just foo/a b\n$ (cd foo && just a b)\n```\n\nAnd will both invoke recipes `a` and `b` in `foo/justfile`.\n\n### Imports\n\nOne `justfile` can include the contents of another using `import` statements.\n\nIf you have the following `justfile`:\n\n```justfile\nimport 'foo/bar.just'\n\na: b\n  @echo A\n```\n\nAnd the following text in `foo/bar.just`:\n\n```just\nb:\n  @echo B\n```\n\n`foo/bar.just` will be included in `justfile` and recipe `b` will be defined:\n\n```console\n$ just b\nB\n$ just a\nB\nA\n```\n\nThe `import` path can be absolute or relative to the location of the justfile\ncontaining it. A leading `~/` in the import path is replaced with the current\nusers home directory.\n\nJustfiles are insensitive to order, so included files can reference variables\nand recipes defined after the `import` statement.\n\nImported files can themselves contain `import`s, which are processed\nrecursively.\n\n`allow-duplicate-recipes` and `allow-duplicate-variables` allow duplicate\nrecipes and variables, respectively, to override each other, instead of\nproducing an error.\n\nWithin a module, later definitions override earlier definitions:\n\n```just\nset allow-duplicate-recipes\n\nfoo:\n\nfoo:\n  echo 'yes'\n```\n\nWhen `import`s are involved, things unfortunately get much more complicated and\nhard to explain.\n\nShallower definitions always override deeper definitions, so recipes at the top\nlevel will override recipes in imports, and recipes in an import will override\nrecipes in an import which itself imports those recipes.\n\nWhen two duplicate definitions are imported and are at the same depth, the one\nfrom the earlier import will override the one from the later import.\n\nThis is because `just` uses a stack when processing imports, pushing imports\nonto the stack in source-order, and always processing the top of the stack\nnext, so earlier imports are actually handled later by the compiler.\n\nThis is definitely a bug, but since `just` has very strong backwards\ncompatibility guarantees and we take enormous pains not to break anyone's\n`justfile`, we have created issue #2540 to discuss whether or not we can\nactually fix it.\n\nImports may be made optional by putting a `?` after the `import` keyword:\n\n```just\nimport? 'foo/bar.just'\n```\n\nImporting the same source file multiple times is not an error<sup>1.37.0</sup>.\nThis allows importing multiple justfiles, for example `foo.just` and\n`bar.just`, which both import a third justfile containing shared recipes, for\nexample `baz.just`, without the duplicate import of `baz.just` being an error:\n\n```justfile\n# justfile\nimport 'foo.just'\nimport 'bar.just'\n```\n\n```justfile\n# foo.just\nimport 'baz.just'\nfoo: baz\n```\n\n```justfile\n# bar.just\nimport 'baz.just'\nbar: baz\n```\n\n```just\n# baz\nbaz:\n```\n\n### Modules<sup>1.19.0</sup>\n\nA `justfile` can declare modules using `mod` statements.\n\n`mod` statements were stabilized in `just`<sup>1.31.0</sup>. In earlier\nversions, you'll need to use the `--unstable` flag, `set unstable`, or set the\n`JUST_UNSTABLE` environment variable to use them.\n\nIf you have the following `justfile`:\n\n```justfile\nmod bar\n\na:\n  @echo A\n```\n\nAnd the following text in `bar.just`:\n\n```just\nb:\n  @echo B\n```\n\n`bar.just` will be included in `justfile` as a submodule. Recipes, aliases, and\nvariables defined in one submodule cannot be used in another, and each module\nuses its own settings.\n\nRecipes in submodules can be invoked as subcommands:\n\n```console\n$ just bar b\nB\n```\n\nOr with path syntax:\n\n```console\n$ just bar::b\nB\n```\n\nIf a module is named `foo`, just will search for the module file in `foo.just`,\n`foo/mod.just`, `foo/justfile`, and `foo/.justfile`. In the latter two cases,\nthe module file may have any capitalization.\n\nModule statements may be of the form:\n\n```justfile\nmod foo 'PATH'\n```\n\nWhich loads the module's source file from `PATH`, instead of from the usual\nlocations. A leading `~/` in `PATH` is replaced with the current user's home\ndirectory. `PATH` may point to the module source file itself, or to a directory\ncontaining the module source file with the name `mod.just`, `justfile`, or\n`.justfile`. In the latter two cases, the module file may have any\ncapitalization.\n\nEnvironment files are only loaded for the root justfile, and loaded environment\nvariables are available in submodules. Settings in submodules that affect\nenvironment file loading are ignored.\n\nRecipes in submodules without the `[no-cd]` attribute run with the working\ndirectory set to the directory containing the submodule source file.\n\n`justfile()` and `justfile_directory()` always return the path to the root\njustfile and the directory that contains it, even when called from submodule\nrecipes.\n\nModules may be made optional by putting a `?` after the `mod` keyword:\n\n```just\nmod? foo\n```\n\nMissing source files for optional modules do not produce an error.\n\nOptional modules with no source file do not conflict, so you can have multiple\nmod statements with the same name, but with different source file paths, as\nlong as at most one source file exists:\n\n```just\nmod? foo 'bar.just'\nmod? foo 'baz.just'\n```\n\nModules may be given doc comments which appear in `--list`\noutput<sup>1.30.0</sup>:\n\n```justfile\n# foo is a great module!\nmod foo\n```\n\n```console\n$ just --list\nAvailable recipes:\n    foo ... # foo is a great module!\n```\n\nModules are still missing a lot of features, for example, the ability to refer\nto variables in other modules. See the [module improvement tracking\nissue](https://github.com/casey/just/issues/2252) for more information.\n\n### Hiding `justfile`s\n\n`just` looks for `justfile`s named `justfile` and `.justfile`, which can be\nused to keep a `justfile` hidden.\n\n### Just Scripts\n\nBy adding a shebang line to the top of a `justfile` and making it executable,\n`just` can be used as an interpreter for scripts:\n\n```console\n$ cat > script <<EOF\n#!/usr/bin/env just --justfile\n\nfoo:\n  echo foo\nEOF\n$ chmod +x script\n$ ./script foo\necho foo\nfoo\n```\n\nWhen a script with a shebang is executed, the system supplies the path to the\nscript as an argument to the command in the shebang. So, with a shebang of\n`#!/usr/bin/env just --justfile`, the command will be `/usr/bin/env just --justfile PATH_TO_SCRIPT`.\n\nWith the above shebang, `just` will change its working directory to the\nlocation of the script. If you'd rather leave the working directory unchanged,\nuse `#!/usr/bin/env just --working-directory . --justfile`.\n\nNote: Shebang line splitting is not consistent across operating systems. The\nprevious examples have only been tested on macOS. On Linux, you may need to\npass the `-S` flag to `env`:\n\n```just\n#!/usr/bin/env -S just --justfile\n\ndefault:\n  echo foo\n```\n\n### Formatting and dumping `justfile`s\n\nEach `justfile` has a canonical formatting with respect to whitespace and\nnewlines.\n\nYou can overwrite the current justfile with a canonically-formatted version\nusing the currently-unstable `--fmt` flag:\n\n```console\n$ cat justfile\n# A lot of blank lines\n\n\n\n\n\nsome-recipe:\n  echo \"foo\"\n$ just --fmt --unstable\n$ cat justfile\n# A lot of blank lines\n\nsome-recipe:\n    echo \"foo\"\n```\n\nInvoking `just --fmt --check --unstable` runs `--fmt` in check mode. Instead of\noverwriting the `justfile`, `just` will exit with an exit code of 0 if it is\nformatted correctly, and will exit with 1 and print a diff if it is not.\n\nYou can use the `--dump` command to output a formatted version of the\n`justfile` to stdout:\n\n```console\n$ just --dump > formatted-justfile\n```\n\nThe `--dump` command can be used with `--dump-format json` to print a JSON\nrepresentation of a `justfile`.\n\n### Fallback to parent `justfile`s\n\nIf a recipe is not found in a `justfile` and the `fallback` setting is set,\n`just` will look for `justfile`s in the parent directory and up, until it\nreaches the root directory. `just` will stop after it reaches a `justfile` in\nwhich the `fallback` setting is `false` or unset.\n\nAs an example, suppose the current directory contains this `justfile`:\n\n```just\nset fallback\nfoo:\n  echo foo\n```\n\nAnd the parent directory contains this `justfile`:\n\n```just\nbar:\n  echo bar\n```\n\n```console\n$ just bar\nTrying ../justfile\necho bar\nbar\n```\n\n### Avoiding Argument Splitting\n\nGiven this `justfile`:\n\n```just\nfoo argument:\n  touch {{argument}}\n```\n\nThe following command will create two files, `some` and `argument.txt`:\n\n```console\n$ just foo \"some argument.txt\"\n```\n\nThe user's shell will parse `\"some argument.txt\"` as a single argument, but\nwhen `just` replaces `touch {{argument}}` with `touch some argument.txt`, the\nquotes are not preserved, and `touch` will receive two arguments.\n\nThere are a few ways to avoid this: quoting, positional arguments, and exported\narguments.\n\n#### Quoting\n\nQuotes can be added around the `{{argument}}` interpolation:\n\n```just\nfoo argument:\n  touch '{{argument}}'\n```\n\nThis preserves `just`'s ability to catch variable name typos before running,\nfor example if you were to write `{{argument}}`, but will not do what you want\nif the value of `argument` contains single quotes.\n\n#### Positional Arguments\n\nThe `positional-arguments` setting causes all arguments to be passed as\npositional arguments, allowing them to be accessed with `$1`, `$2`, …, and\n`$@`, which can be then double-quoted to avoid further splitting by the shell:\n\n```just\nset positional-arguments\n\nfoo argument:\n  touch \"$1\"\n```\n\nThis defeats `just`'s ability to catch typos, for example if you type `$2`\ninstead of `$1`, but works for all possible values of `argument`, including\nthose with double quotes.\n\n#### Exported Arguments\n\nAll arguments are exported when the `export` setting is set:\n\n```just\nset export\n\nfoo argument:\n  touch \"$argument\"\n```\n\nOr individual arguments may be exported by prefixing them with `$`:\n\n```just\nfoo $argument:\n  touch \"$argument\"\n```\n\nThis defeats `just`'s ability to catch typos, for example if you type\n`$argument`, but works for all possible values of `argument`, including those\nwith double quotes.\n\n### Configuring the Shell\n\nThere are a number of ways to configure the shell for linewise recipes, which\nare the default when a recipe does not start with a `#!` shebang. Their\nprecedence, from highest to lowest, is:\n\n1. The `--shell` and `--shell-arg` command line options. Passing either of\n   these will cause `just` to ignore any settings in the current justfile.\n2. `set windows-shell := [...]`\n3. `set windows-powershell` (deprecated)\n4. `set shell := [...]`\n\nSince `set windows-shell` has higher precedence than `set shell`, you can use\n`set windows-shell` to pick a shell on Windows, and `set shell` to pick a shell\nfor all other platforms.\n\n### Timestamps\n\n`just` can print timestamps before each recipe commands:\n\n```just\nrecipe:\n  echo one\n  sleep 2\n  echo two\n```\n\n```\n$ just --timestamp recipe\n[07:28:46] echo one\none\n[07:28:46] sleep 2\n[07:28:48] echo two\ntwo\n```\n\nBy default, timestamps are formatted as `HH:MM:SS`. The format can be changed\nwith `--timestamp-format`:\n\n```\n$ just --timestamp recipe --timestamp-format '%H:%M:%S%.3f %Z'\n[07:32:11:.349 UTC] echo one\none\n[07:32:11:.350 UTC] sleep 2\n[07:32:13:.352 UTC] echo two\ntwo\n```\n\nThe argument to `--timestamp-format` is a `strftime`-style format string, see\nthe\n[`chrono` library docs](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html)\nfor details.\n\n### Signal Handling\n\n[Signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) are messsages sent to\nrunning programs to trigger specific behavior. For example, `SIGINT` is sent to\nall processes in the terminal forground process group when `CTRL-C` is pressed.\n\n`just` tries to exit when requested by a signal, but it also tries to avoid\nleaving behind running child proccesses, two goals which are somewhat in\nconflict.\n\nIf `just` exits leaving behind child processes, the user will have no recourse\nbut to `ps aux | grep` for the children and manually `kill` them, a tedious\nendevour.\n\n#### Fatal Signals\n\n`SIGHUP`, `SIGINT`, and `SIGQUIT` are generated when the user closes the\nterminal, types `ctrl-c`, or types `ctrl-\\`, respectively, and are sent to all\nprocesses in the foreground process group.\n\n`SIGTERM` is the default signal sent by the `kill` command, and is delivered\nonly to its intended victim.\n\nWhen a child process is not running, `just` will exit immediately on receipt of\nany of the above signals.\n\nWhen a child process *is* running, `just` will wait until it terminates, to\navoid leaving it behind.\n\nAdditionally, on receipt of `SIGTERM`, `just` will forward `SIGTERM` to any\nrunning children<sup>1.41.0</sup>, since unlike other fatal signals, `SIGTERM`,\nwas likely sent to `just` alone.\n\nRegardless of whether a child process terminates successfully after `just`\nreceives a fatal signal, `just` halts execution.\n\n#### `SIGINFO`\n\n`SIGINFO` is sent to all processes in the foreground process group when the\nuser types `ctrl-t` on\n[BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution)-derived\noperating systems, including MacOS, but not Linux.\n\n`just` responds by printing a list of all child process IDs and\ncommands<sup>1.41.0</sup>.\n\n#### Windows\n\nOn Windows, `just` behaves as if it had received `SIGINT` when the user types\n`ctrl-c`. Other signals are unsupported.\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\nA changelog for the latest release is available in\n[CHANGELOG.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casey/just/master/CHANGELOG.md).\nChangelogs for previous releases are available on\n[the releases page](https://github.com/casey/just/releases). `just --changelog`\ncan also be used to make a `just` binary print its changelog.\n\nMiscellanea\n-----------\n\n### Re-running recipes when files change\n\n[`watchexec`](https://github.com/mattgreen/watchexec) can re-run any command\nwhen files change.\n\nTo re-run the recipe `foo` when any file changes:\n\n```console\nwatchexec just foo\n```\n\nSee `watchexec --help` for more info, including how to specify which files\nshould be watched for changes.\n\n### Parallelism\n\nDependencies may be run in parallel with the `[parallel]` attribute.\n\nIn this `justfile`, `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` will execute in parallel when\n`main` is run:\n\n```just\n[parallel]\nmain: foo bar baz\n\nfoo:\n  sleep 1\n\nbar:\n  sleep 1\n\nbaz:\n  sleep 1\n```\n\nGNU `parallel` may be used to run recipe lines concurrently:\n\n```just\nparallel:\n  #!/usr/bin/env -S parallel --shebang --ungroup --jobs {{ num_cpus() }}\n  echo task 1 start; sleep 3; echo task 1 done\n  echo task 2 start; sleep 3; echo task 2 done\n  echo task 3 start; sleep 3; echo task 3 done\n  echo task 4 start; sleep 3; echo task 4 done\n```\n\n### Shell Alias\n\nFor lightning-fast command running, put `alias j=just` in your shell's\nconfiguration file.\n\nIn `bash`, the aliased command may not keep the shell completion functionality\ndescribed in the next section. Add the following line to your `.bashrc` to use\nthe same completion function as `just` for your aliased command:\n\n```console\ncomplete -F _just -o bashdefault -o default j\n```\n\n### Shell Completion Scripts\n\nShell completion scripts for Bash, Elvish, Fish, Nushell, PowerShell, and Zsh\nare available [release archives](https://github.com/casey/just/releases).\n\nThe `just` binary can also generate the same completion scripts at runtime\nusing `just --completions SHELL`:\n\n```console\n$ just --completions zsh > just.zsh\n```\n\nPlease refer to your shell's documentation for how to install them.\n\n*macOS Note:* Recent versions of macOS use zsh as the default shell. If you use\nHomebrew to install `just`, it will automatically install the most recent copy\nof the zsh completion script in the Homebrew zsh directory, which the built-in\nversion of zsh doesn't know about by default. It's best to use this copy of the\nscript if possible, since it will be updated whenever you update `just` via\nHomebrew. Also, many other Homebrew packages use the same location for\ncompletion scripts, and the built-in zsh doesn't know about those either. To\ntake advantage of `just` completion in zsh in this scenario, you can set\n`fpath` to the Homebrew location before calling `compinit`. Note also that Oh\nMy Zsh runs `compinit` by default. So your `.zshrc` file could look like this:\n\n```zsh\n# Init Homebrew, which adds environment variables\neval \"$(brew shellenv)\"\n\nfpath=($HOMEBREW_PREFIX/share/zsh/site-functions $fpath)\n\n# Then choose one of these options:\n# 1. If you're using Oh My Zsh, you can initialize it here\n# source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh\n\n# 2. Otherwise, run compinit yourself\n# autoload -U compinit\n# compinit\n```\n\n### Man Page\n\n`just` can print its own man page with `just --man`. Man pages are written in\n[`roff`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roff_%28software%29), a venerable markup\nlanguage and one of the first practical applications of Unix. If you have\n[`groff`](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/) installed you can view the man\npage with  `just --man | groff -mandoc -Tascii | less`.\n\n### Grammar\n\nA non-normative grammar of `justfile`s can be found in\n[GRAMMAR.md](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/GRAMMAR.md).\n\n### just.sh\n\nBefore `just` was a fancy Rust program it was a tiny shell script that called\n`make`. You can find the old version in\n[contrib/just.sh](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/contrib/just.sh).\n\n### Global and User `justfile`s\n\nIf you want some recipes to be available everywhere, you have a few options.\n\n#### Global Justfile\n\n`just --global-justfile`, or `just -g` for short, searches the following paths,\nin-order, for a justfile:\n\n- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/just/justfile`\n- `$HOME/.config/just/justfile`\n- `$HOME/justfile`\n- `$HOME/.justfile`\n\nYou can put recipes that are used across many projects in a global justfile to\neasily invoke them from any directory.\n\n#### User justfile tips\n\nYou can also adopt some of the following workflows. These tips assume you've\ncreated a `justfile` at `~/.user.justfile`, but you can put this `justfile`\nat any convenient path on your system.\n\n##### Recipe Aliases\n\nIf you want to call the recipes in `~/.user.justfile` by name, and don't mind\ncreating an alias for every recipe, add the following to your shell's\ninitialization script:\n\n```console\nfor recipe in `just --justfile ~/.user.justfile --summary`; do\n  alias $recipe=\"just --justfile ~/.user.justfile --working-directory . $recipe\"\ndone\n```\n\nNow, if you have a recipe called `foo` in `~/.user.justfile`, you can just type\n`foo` at the command line to run it.\n\nIt took me way too long to realize that you could create recipe aliases like\nthis. Notwithstanding my tardiness, I am very pleased to bring you this major\nadvance in `justfile` technology.\n\n##### Forwarding Alias\n\nIf you'd rather not create aliases for every recipe, you can create a single alias:\n\n```console\nalias .j='just --justfile ~/.user.justfile --working-directory .'\n```\n\nNow, if you have a recipe called `foo` in `~/.user.justfile`, you can just type\n`.j foo` at the command line to run it.\n\nI'm pretty sure that nobody actually uses this feature, but it's there.\n\n¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n##### Customization\n\nYou can customize the above aliases with additional options. For example, if\nyou'd prefer to have the recipes in your `justfile` run in your home directory,\ninstead of the current directory:\n\n```console\nalias .j='just --justfile ~/.user.justfile --working-directory ~'\n```\n\n### Node.js `package.json` Script Compatibility\n\nThe following export statement gives `just` recipes access to local Node module\nbinaries, and makes `just` recipe commands behave more like `script` entries in\nNode.js `package.json` files:\n\n```just\nexport PATH := \"./node_modules/.bin:\" + env_var('PATH')\n```\n\n### Paths on Windows\n\nOn Windows, all functions that return paths, except `invocation_directory()`\nwill return `\\`-separated paths. When not using PowerShell or `cmd.exe` these\npaths should be quoted to prevent the `\\`s from being interpreted as character\nescapes:\n\n```just\nls:\n    echo '{{absolute_path(\".\")}}'\n```\n\n`cygpath.exe` is an executable included in some distributions of Unix userlands\nfor Windows, including [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) and\n[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Windows.\n\n`just` uses `cygpath.exe` in two places:\n\nFor backwards compatibility, `invocation_directory()`, uses `cygpath.exe` to\nconvert the invocation directory into a unix-style `/`-separated path. Use\n`invocation_directory_native()` to get the native, Windows-style path. On unix,\n`invocation_directory()` and `invocation_directory_native()` both return the\nsame unix-style path.\n\n`cygpath.exe` is used also used to convert Unix-style shebang lines into\nWindows paths. As an alternative, the `[script]` attribute, currently unstable,\ncan be used, which does not depend on `cygpath.exe`.\n\nIf `cygpath.exe` is available, you can use it to convert between path styles:\n\n```just\nfoo_unix := '/hello/world'\nfoo_windows := shell('cygpath --windows $1', foo_unix)\n\nbar_windows := 'C:\\hello\\world'\nbar_unix := shell('cygpath --unix $1', bar_windows)\n```\n\n### Remote Justfiles\n\nIf you wish to include a `mod` or `import` source file in many `justfiles`\nwithout needing to duplicate it, you can use an optional `mod` or `import`,\nalong with a recipe to fetch the module source:\n\n```just\nimport? 'foo.just'\n\nfetch:\n  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casey/just/master/justfile > foo.just\n```\n\nGiven the above `justfile`, after running `just fetch`, the recipes in\n`foo.just` will be available.\n\n### Printing Complex Strings\n\n`echo` can be used to print strings, but because it processes escape sequences,\nlike `\\n`, and different implementations of `echo` recognize different escape\nsequences, using `printf` is often a better choice.\n\n`printf` takes a C-style format string and any number of arguments, which are\ninterpolated into the format string.\n\nThis can be combined with indented, triple quoted strings to emulate shell\nheredocs.\n\nSubstitution complex strings into recipe bodies with `{…}` can also lead to\ntrouble as it may be split by the shell into multiple arguments depending on\nthe presence of whitespace and quotes. Exporting complex strings as environment\nvariables and referring to them with `\"$NAME\"`, note the double quotes, can\nalso help.\n\nPutting all this together, to print a string verbatim to standard output, with\nall its various escape sequences and quotes undisturbed:\n\n```just\nexport FOO := '''\n  a complicated string with\n  some dis\\tur\\bi\\ng escape sequences\n  and \"quotes\" of 'different' kinds\n'''\n\nbar:\n  printf %s \"$FOO\"\n```\n\n### Alternatives and Prior Art\n\nThere is no shortage of command runners!

Integration tests are in the [tests\ndirectory](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/tests) and test the `just`\nbinary from the outside by invoking `just` on a given `justfile` and set of\ncommand-line arguments, and checking the output.\n\nYou should write whichever type of tests are easiest to write for your feature\nwhile still providing good test coverage.\n\nUnit tests are useful for testing new Rust functions that are used internally\nand as an aid for development. A good example are the unit tests which cover\nthe\n[`unindent()` function](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/src/unindent.rs),\nused to unindent triple-quoted strings and backticks. `unindent()` has a bunch\nof tricky edge cases which are easy to exercise with unit tests that call\n`unindent()` directly.\n\nIntegration tests are useful for making sure that the final behavior of the\n`just` binary is correct. `unindent()` is also covered by integration tests\nwhich make sure that evaluating a triple-quoted string produces the correct\nunindented value. However, there are not integration tests for all possible\ncases. These are covered by faster, more concise unit tests that call\n`unindent()` directly.\n\nIntegration tests use the `Test` struct, a builder which allows for easily\ninvoking `just` with a given `justfile`, arguments, and environment variables,\nand checking the program's stdout, stderr, and exit code .\n\n### Contribution Workflow\n\n1. Make sure the feature is wanted. There should be an open issue about the\n   feature with a comment from [@casey](https://github.com/casey) saying that\n   it's a good idea or seems reasonable. If there isn't, open a new issue and\n   ask for feedback.\n\n   There are lots of good features which can't be merged, either because they\n   aren't backwards compatible, have an implementation which would\n   overcomplicate the codebase, or go against `just`'s design philosophy.\n\n2. Settle on the design of the feature. If the feature has multiple possible\n   implementations or syntaxes, make sure to nail down the details in the\n   issue.\n\n3. Clone `just` and start hacking. The best workflow is to have the code you're\n   working on in an editor alongside a job that re-runs tests whenever a file\n   changes. You can run such a job by installing\n   [cargo-watch](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch) with `cargo install\n   cargo-watch` and running `just watch test`.\n\n4. Add a failing test for your feature. Most of the time this will be an\n   integration test which exercises the feature end-to-end. Look for an\n   appropriate file to put the test in in\n   [tests](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/tests), or add a new file\n   in [tests](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/tests) and add a `mod`\n   statement importing that file in\n   [tests/lib.rs](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/tests/lib.rs).\n\n5. Implement the feature.\n\n6. Run `just ci` to make sure that all tests, lints, and checks pass. Requires\n   [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and\n   [mdbook-linkcheck](https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/mdbook-linkcheck).\n\n7. Open a PR with the new code that is editable by maintainers. PRs often\n   require rebasing and minor tweaks. If the PR is not editable by maintainers,\n   each rebase and tweak will require a round trip of code review. Your PR may\n   be summarily closed if it is not editable by maintainers.\n\n8. Incorporate feedback.\n\n9. Enjoy the sweet feeling of your PR getting merged!\n\nFeel free to open a draft PR at any time for discussion and feedback.\n\n### Hints\n\nHere are some hints to get you started with specific kinds of new features,\nwhich you can use in addition to the contribution workflow above.\n\n#### Adding a New Attribute\n\n1. Write a new integration test in\n   [tests/attributes.rs](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/tests/attributes.rs).\n\n2. Add a new variant to the\n   [`Attribute`](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/src/attribute.rs)\n   enum.\n\n3. Implement the functionality of the new attribute.\n\n4. Run `just ci` to make sure that all tests pass.\n\n### Janus\n\n[Janus](https://github.com/casey/janus) is a tool for checking whether a change\nto `just` breaks or changes the interpretation of existing `justfile`s. It\ncollects and analyzes public `justfile`s on GitHub.\n\nBefore merging a particularly large or gruesome change, Janus should be run to\nmake sure that nothing breaks. Don't worry about running Janus yourself, Casey\nwill happily run it for you on changes that need it.\n\n### Minimum Supported Rust Version\n\nThe minimum supported Rust version, or MSRV, is current stable Rust. It may\nbuild on older versions of Rust, but this is not guaranteed.\n\n### New Releases\n\nNew releases of `just` are made frequently so that users quickly get access to\nnew features.\n\nRelease commit messages use the following template:\n\n```\nRelease x.y.z\n\n- Bump version: x.y.z → x.y.z\n- Update changelog\n- Update changelog contributor credits\n- Update dependencies\n- Update version references in readme\n```\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n--------------------------\n\n### What are the idiosyncrasies of Make that Just avoids?\n\n`make` has some behaviors which are confusing, complicated, or make it\nunsuitable for use as a general command runner.\n\nOne example is that under some circumstances, `make` won't actually run the\ncommands in a recipe. For example, if you have a file called `test` and the\nfollowing makefile:\n\n```just\ntest:\n  ./test\n```\n\n`make` will refuse to run your tests:\n\n```console\n$ make test\nmake: `test' is up to date.\n```\n\n`make` assumes that the `test` recipe produces a file called `test`. Since this\nfile exists and the recipe has no other dependencies, `make` thinks that it\ndoesn't have anything to do and exits.\n\nTo be fair, this behavior is desirable when using `make` as a build system, but\nnot when using it as a command runner. You can disable this behavior for\nspecific targets using `make`'s built-in\n[`.PHONY` target name](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Phony-Targets.html),\nbut the syntax is verbose and can be hard to remember. The explicit list of\nphony targets, written separately from the recipe definitions, also introduces\nthe risk of accidentally defining a new non-phony target. In `just`, all\nrecipes are treated as if they were phony.\n\nOther examples of `make`'s idiosyncrasies include the difference between `=`\nand `:=` in assignments, the confusing error messages that are produced if you\nmess up your makefile, needing `$$` to use environment variables in recipes,\nand incompatibilities between different flavors of `make`.\n\n### What's the relationship between Just and Cargo build scripts?\n\n[`cargo` build scripts](http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html) have a pretty\nspecific use, which is to control how `cargo` builds your Rust project. This\nmight include adding flags to `rustc` invocations, building an external\ndependency, or running some kind of codegen step.\n\n`just`, on the other hand, is for all the other miscellaneous commands you\nmight run as part of development. Things like running tests in different\nconfigurations, linting your code, pushing build artifacts to a server,\nremoving temporary files, and the like.\n\nAlso, although `just` is written in Rust, it can be used regardless of the\nlanguage or build system your project uses.\n\nFurther Ramblings\n-----------------\n\nI personally find it very useful to write a `justfile` for almost every\nproject, big or small.\n\nOn a big project with multiple contributors, it's very useful to have a file\nwith all the commands needed to work on the project close at hand.\n\nThere are probably different commands to test, build, lint, deploy, and the\nlike, and having them all in one place is useful and cuts down on the time you\nhave to spend telling people which commands to run and how to type them.\n\nAnd, with an easy place to put commands, it's likely that you'll come up with\nother useful things which are part of the project's collective wisdom, but\nwhich aren't written down anywhere, like the arcane commands needed for some\npart of your revision control workflow, to install all your project's\ndependencies, or all the random flags you might need to pass to the build\nsystem.\n\nSome ideas for recipes:\n\n- Deploying/publishing the project\n\n- Building in release mode vs debug mode\n\n- Running in debug mode or with logging enabled\n\n- Complex git workflows\n\n- Updating dependencies\n\n- Running different sets of tests, for example fast tests vs slow tests, or\n  running them with verbose output\n\n- Any complex set of commands that you really should write down somewhere, if\n  only to be able to remember them\n\nEven for small, personal projects it's nice to be able to remember commands by\nname instead of ^Reverse searching your shell history, and it's a huge boon to\nbe able to go into an old project written in a random language with a\nmysterious build system and know that all the commands you need to do whatever\nyou need to do are in the `justfile`, and that if you type `just` something\nuseful (or at least interesting!) will probably happen.\n\nFor ideas for recipes, check out\n[this project's `justfile`](https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/justfile),\nor some of the\n`justfile`s\n[out in the wild](https://github.com/search?q=path%3A**%2Fjustfile&type=code).\n\nAnyways, I think that's about it for this incredibly long-winded README.\n\nI hope you enjoy using `just` and find great success and satisfaction in all\nyour computational endeavors!\n\n😸\n\n[🔼 Back to the top!](#just)\n",

Delta aims to make this both efficient and enjoyable: it allows you to make extensive changes to the layout and styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close to the default git/diff output.\n\n<table align=\"center\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <img width=400px src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/86275526-76792100-bba1-11ea-9e78-6be9baa80b29.png\" alt=\"image\" />\n      <br>\n      <p align=\"center\"><sub>delta with <code>line-numbers</code> activated</sub></p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<table align=\"center\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <img width=800px src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/87230973-412eb900-c381-11ea-8aec-cc200290bd1b.png\" alt=\"image\" />\n      <br>\n      <p align=\"center\"><sub>delta with <code>side-by-side</code> and <code>line-numbers</code> activated</sub></p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\nHere's what `git show` can look like with git configured to use delta:\n\n<br>\n\n<table align=\"center\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <img width=500px style=\"border: 1px solid black\"\n           src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/81058545-a5725f80-8e9c-11ea-912e-d21954586a44.png\"\n           alt=\"image\" />\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <img width=500px style=\"border: 1px solid black\"\n           src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/81058911-6abcf700-8e9d-11ea-93be-e212824ec03d.png\"\n           alt=\"image\" />\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      \"Dracula\" theme\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      \"GitHub\" theme\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Syntax-highlighting themes\n\n**All the syntax-highlighting color themes that are available with [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/) are available with delta:**\n\n<br>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <img width=400px style=\"border: 1px solid black\"\n           src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/149431273-e3ad049d-771e-4186-869d-0e57967958a6.png\"\n           alt=\"image\" />\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <img width=400px style=\"border: 1px solid black\"\n           src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/149431419-48836001-2afc-4fd0-97ad-561a69b71db7.png\"\n           alt=\"image\" />\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <code>delta --show-syntax-themes --dark</code>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <code>delta --show-syntax-themes --light</code>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<br>\n\n### Side-by-side view\n\n[[User manual](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/side-by-side-view.html)]\n\n```gitconfig\n[delta]\n    side-by-side = true\n```\n\nBy default, side-by-side view has line-numbers activated, and has syntax highlighting in both the left and right panels: [[config](#side-by-side-view-1)]\n\n<table><tr><td><img width=800px src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/87230973-412eb900-c381-11ea-8aec-cc200290bd1b.png\" alt=\"image\" /></td></tr></table>\n\nSide-by-side view wraps long lines automatically:\n\n<table><tr><td><img width=600px src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/139064537-f8479504-16d3-429a-b4f6-d0122438adaa.png\" alt=\"image\" /></td></tr></table>\n\n### Line numbers\n\n[[User manual](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/line-numbers.html)]\n\n```gitconfig\n[delta]\n    line-numbers = true\n```\n\n<table><tr><td><img width=400px src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/86275526-76792100-bba1-11ea-9e78-6be9baa80b29.png\" alt=\"image\" /></td></tr></table>\n\n### Merge conflicts\n\n[[User manual](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/merge-conflicts.html)]\n\n<table><tr><td><img width=500px src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/144783121-bb549100-69d8-41b8-ac62-1704f1f7b43e.png\" alt=\"image\" /></td></tr></table>\n\n### Git blame\n\n[[User manual](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/git-blame.html)]\n\n<table><tr><td><img width=600px src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52205/141891376-1fdb87dc-1d9c-4ad6-9d72-eeb19a8aeb0b.png\" alt=\"image\" /></td></tr></table>\n\n### Ripgrep, git grep\n\n[[User manual](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/grep.html)]\n\n<table><tr><td>\n<img width=\"600px\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/dandavison/open-in-editor/assets/52205/d203d380-5acb-4296-aeb9-e38c73d6c27f\">\n</td></tr></table>\n\n### Installation and usage\n\nPlease see the [user manual](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/) and `delta --help`.\n\n### Maintainers\n\n- [@dandavison](https://github.com/dandavison)\n- [@th1000s](https://github.com/th1000s)\n",

Our class had these design goals:\n\n- **Intuitive syntax**. In languages such as Python, JSON feels like a first-class data type. We used all the operator magic of modern C++ to achieve the same feeling in your code. Check out the [examples below](#examples) and you'll know what I mean.\n\n- **Trivial integration**. Our whole code consists of a single header file [`json.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp). That's it. No library, no subproject, no dependencies, no complex build system. The class is written in vanilla C++11. All in all, everything should require no adjustment of your compiler flags or project settings. The library is also included in all popular [package managers](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/).\n\n- **Serious testing**. Our code is heavily [unit-tested](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/tests/src) and covers [100%](https://coveralls.io/r/nlohmann/json) of the code, including all exceptional behavior. Furthermore, we checked with [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org) and the [Clang Sanitizers](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/index.html) that there are no memory leaks. [Google OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/json) additionally runs fuzz tests against all parsers 24/7, effectively executing billions of tests so far. To maintain high quality, the project is following the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) best practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/289). See the [quality assurance](https://json.nlohmann.me/community/quality_assurance) overview documentation.\n\nOther aspects were not so important to us:\n\n- **Memory efficiency**. Each JSON object has an overhead of one pointer (the maximal size of a union) and one enumeration element (1 byte). The default generalization uses the following C++ data types: `std::string` for strings, `int64_t`, `uint64_t` or `double` for numbers, `std::map` for objects, `std::vector` for arrays, and `bool` for Booleans. However, you can template the generalized class `basic_json` to your needs.\n\n- **Speed**. There are certainly [faster JSON libraries](https://github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark#parsing-time) out there. However, if your goal is to speed up your development by adding JSON support with a single header, then this library is the way to go. If you know how to use a `std::vector` or `std::map`, you are already set.\n\nSee the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#please-dont) for more information.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nYou can sponsor this library at [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nlohmann).\n\n### :raising_hand: Priority Sponsor\n\n- [Martti Laine](https://github.com/codeclown)\n- [Paul Harrington](https://github.com/phrrngtn)\n\n### :label: Named Sponsors\n\n- [Michael Hartmann](https://github.com/reFX-Mike)\n- [Stefan Hagen](https://github.com/sthagen)\n- [Steve Sperandeo](https://github.com/homer6)\n- [Robert Jefe Lindstädt](https://github.com/eljefedelrodeodeljefe)\n- [Steve Wagner](https://github.com/ciroque)\n- [Lion Yang](https://github.com/LionNatsu)\n\n### Further support\n\nThe development of the library is further supported by JetBrains by providing free access to their IDE tools.\n\n[![JetBrains logo.](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/jetbrains.svg)](https://jb.gg/OpenSourceSupport)\n\nThanks everyone!\n\n## Support\n\n:question: If you have a **question**, please check if it is already answered in the [**FAQ**](https://json.nlohmann.me/home/faq/) or the [**Q&A**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/categories/q-a) section.

documentation**](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/)\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are some examples to give you an idea how to use the class.\n\nBesides the examples below, you may want to:\n\n→ Check the [documentation](https://json.nlohmann.me/)\\\n→ Browse the [standalone example files](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/examples)\\\n→ Read the full [API Documentation](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/) with self-contained examples for every function\n\n### Read JSON from a file\n\nThe `json` class provides an API for manipulating a JSON value. To create a `json` object by reading a JSON file:\n\n```cpp\n#include <fstream>\n#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>\nusing json = nlohmann::json;\n\n// ...\n\nstd::ifstream f(\"example.json\");\njson data = json::parse(f);\n```\n\nIf using modules (enabled with `NLOHMANN_JSON_BUILD_MODULES`), this example becomes:\n```cpp\nimport std;\nimport nlohmann.json;\n\nusing json = nlohmann::json;\n\n// ...\n\nstd::ifstream f(\"example.json\");\njson data = json::parse(f);\n```\n\n### Creating `json` objects from JSON literals\n\nAssume you want to create hard-code this literal JSON value in a file, as a `json` object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pi\": 3.141,\n  \"happy\": true\n}\n```\n\nThere are various options:\n\n```cpp\n// Using (raw) string literals and json::parse\njson ex1 = json::parse(R\"(\n  {\n    \"pi\": 3.141,\n    \"happy\": true\n  }\n)\");\n\n// Using user-defined (raw) string literals\nusing namespace nlohmann::literals;\njson ex2 = R\"(\n  {\n    \"pi\": 3.141,\n    \"happy\": true\n  }\n)\"_json;\n\n// Using initializer lists\njson ex3 = {\n  {\"happy\", true},\n  {\"pi\", 3.141},\n};\n```\n\n### JSON as a first-class data type\n\nHere are some examples to give you an idea how to use the class.\n\nAssume you want to create the JSON object\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pi\": 3.141,\n  \"happy\": true,\n  \"name\": \"Niels\",\n  \"nothing\": null,\n  \"answer\": {\n    \"everything\": 42\n  },\n  \"list\": [1, 0, 2],\n  \"object\": {\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"value\": 42.99\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this library, you could write:\n\n```cpp\n// create an empty structure (null)\njson j;\n\n// add a number stored as double (note the implicit conversion of j to an object)\nj[\"pi\"] = 3.141;\n\n// add a Boolean stored as bool\nj[\"happy\"] = true;\n\n// add a string stored as std::string\nj[\"name\"] = \"Niels\";\n\n// add another null object by passing nullptr\nj[\"nothing\"] = nullptr;\n\n// add an object inside the object\nj[\"answer\"][\"everything\"] = 42;\n\n// add an array stored as std::vector (using an initializer list)\nj[\"list\"] = { 1, 0, 2 };\n\n// add another object (using an initializer list of pairs)\nj[\"object\"] = { {\"currency\", \"USD\"}, {\"value\", 42.99} };\n\n// instead, you could also write (which looks very similar to the JSON above)\njson j2 = {\n  {\"pi\", 3.141},\n  {\"happy\", true},\n  {\"name\", \"Niels\"},\n  {\"nothing\", nullptr},\n  {\"answer\", {\n    {\"everything\", 42}\n  }},\n  {\"list\", {1, 0, 2}},\n  {\"object\", {\n    {\"currency\", \"USD\"},\n    {\"value\", 42.99}\n  }}\n};\n```\n\nNote that in all these cases, you never need to \"tell\" the compiler which JSON value type you want to use. If you want to be explicit or express some edge cases, the functions [`json::array()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/array/) and [`json::object()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/object/) will help:\n\n```cpp\n// a way to express the empty array []\njson empty_array_explicit = json::array();\n\n// ways to express the empty object {}\njson empty_object_implicit = json({});\njson empty_object_explicit = json::object();\n\n// a way to express an _array_ of key/value pairs [[\"currency\", \"USD\"], [\"value\", 42.99]]\njson array_not_object = json::array({ {\"currency\", \"USD\"}, {\"value\", 42.99} });\n```\n\n### Serialization / Deserialization\n\n#### To/from strings\n\nYou can create a JSON value (deserialization) by appending `_json` to a string literal:\n\n```cpp\n// create object from string literal\njson j = \"{ \\\"happy\\\": true, \\\"pi\\\": 3.141 }\"_json;\n\n// or even nicer with a raw string literal\nauto j2 = R\"(\n  {\n    \"happy\": true,\n    \"pi\": 3.141\n  }\n)\"_json;\n```\n\nNote that without appending the `_json` suffix, the passed string literal is not parsed, but just used as JSON string\nvalue. That is, `json j = \"{ \\\"happy\\\": true, \\\"pi\\\": 3.141 }\"` would just store the string\n`\"{ \"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141 }\"` rather than parsing the actual object.\n\nThe string literal should be brought into scope with `using namespace nlohmann::literals;`\n(see [`json::parse()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/operator_literal_json/)).\n\nThe above example can also be expressed explicitly using [`json::parse()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/parse/):\n\n```cpp\n// parse explicitly\nauto j3 = json::parse(R\"({\"happy\": true, \"pi\": 3.141})\");\n```\n\nYou can also get a string representation of a JSON value (serialize):\n\n```cpp\n// explicit conversion to string\nstd::string s = j.dump();    // {\"happy\":true,\"pi\":3.141}\n\n// serialization with pretty printing\n// pass in the amount of spaces to indent\nstd::cout << j.dump(4) << std::endl;\n// {\n//     \"happy\": true,\n//     \"pi\": 3.141\n// }\n```\n\nNote the difference between serialization and assignment:\n\n```cpp\n// store a string in a JSON value\njson j_string = \"this is a string\";\n\n// retrieve the string value\nauto cpp_string = j_string.get<std::string>();\n// retrieve the string value (alternative when a variable already exists)\nstd::string cpp_string2;\nj_string.get_to(cpp_string2);\n\n// retrieve the serialized value (explicit JSON serialization)\nstd::string serialized_string = j_string.dump();\n\n// output of original string\nstd::cout << cpp_string << \" == \" << cpp_string2 << \" == \" << j_string.get<std::string>() << '\\n';\n// output of serialized value\nstd::cout << j_string << \" == \" << serialized_string << std::endl;\n```\n\n[`.dump()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/dump/) returns the originally stored string value.\n\nNote the library only supports UTF-8. When you store strings with different encodings in the library, calling [`dump()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/dump/) may throw an exception unless `json::error_handler_t::replace` or `json::error_handler_t::ignore` are used as error handlers.\n\n#### To/from streams (e.g., files, string streams)\n\nYou can also use streams to serialize and deserialize:\n\n```cpp\n// deserialize from standard input\njson j;\nstd::cin >> j;\n\n// serialize to standard output\nstd::cout << j;\n\n// the setw manipulator was overloaded to set the indentation for pretty printing\nstd::cout << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl;\n```\n\nThese operators work for any subclasses of `std::istream` or `std::ostream`. Here is the same example with files:\n\n```cpp\n// read a JSON file\nstd::ifstream i(\"file.json\");\njson j;\ni >> j;\n\n// write prettified JSON to another file\nstd::ofstream o(\"pretty.json\");\no << std::setw(4) << j << std::endl;\n```\n\nPlease note that setting the exception bit for `failbit` is inappropriate for this use case. It will result in program termination due to the `noexcept` specifier in use.\n\n#### Read from iterator range\n\nYou can also parse JSON from an iterator range; that is, from any container accessible by iterators whose `value_type` is an integral type of 1, 2, or 4 bytes, which will be interpreted as UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 respectively. For instance, a `std::vector<std::uint8_t>`, or a `std::list<std::uint16_t>`:\n\n```cpp\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v = {'t', 'r', 'u', 'e'};\njson j = json::parse(v.begin(), v.end());\n```\n\nYou may leave the iterators for the range [begin, end):\n\n```cpp\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v = {'t', 'r', 'u', 'e'};\njson j = json::parse(v);\n```\n\n#### Custom data source\n\nSince the parse function accepts arbitrary iterator ranges, you can provide your own data sources by implementing the `LegacyInputIterator` concept.\n\n```cpp\nstruct MyContainer {\n  void advance();\n  const char& get_current();\n};\n\nstruct MyIterator {\n    using difference_type = std::ptrdiff_t;\n    using value_type = char;\n    using pointer = const char*;\n    using reference = const char&;\n    using iterator_category = std::input_iterator_tag;\n\n    MyIterator& operator++() {\n        target->advance();\n        return *this;\n    }\n\n    bool operator!=(const MyIterator& rhs) const {\n        return rhs.target != target;\n    }\n\n    reference operator*() const {\n        return target->get_current();\n    }\n\n    MyContainer* target = nullptr;\n};\n\nMyIterator begin(MyContainer& tgt) {\n    return MyIterator{&tgt};\n}\n\nMyIterator end(const MyContainer&) {\n    return {};\n}\n\nvoid foo() {\n    MyContainer c;\n    json j = json::parse(c);\n}\n```\n\n#### SAX interface\n\nThe library uses a SAX-like interface with the following functions:\n\n```cpp\n// called when null is parsed\nbool null();\n\n// called when a boolean is parsed; value is passed\nbool boolean(bool val);\n\n// called when a signed or unsigned integer number is parsed; value is passed\nbool number_integer(number_integer_t val);\nbool number_unsigned(number_unsigned_t val);\n\n// called when a floating-point number is parsed; value and original string is passed\nbool number_float(number_float_t val, const string_t& s);\n\n// called when a string is parsed; value is passed and can be safely moved away\nbool string(string_t& val);\n// called when a binary value is parsed; value is passed and can be safely moved away\nbool binary(binary_t& val);\n\n// called when an object or array begins or ends, resp. The number of elements is passed (or -1 if not known)\nbool start_object(std::size_t elements);\nbool end_object();\nbool start_array(std::size_t elements);\nbool end_array();\n// called when an object key is parsed; value is passed and can be safely moved away\nbool key(string_t& val);\n\n// called when a parse error occurs; byte position, the last token, and an exception is passed\nbool parse_error(std::size_t position, const std::string& last_token, const detail::exception& ex);\n```\n\nThe return value of each function determines whether parsing should proceed.\n\nTo implement your own SAX handler, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Implement the SAX interface in a class. You can use class `nlohmann::json_sax<json>` as base class, but you can also use any class where the functions described above are implemented and public.\n2. Create an object of your SAX interface class, e.g. `my_sax`.\n3. Call `bool json::sax_parse(input, &my_sax)`; where the first parameter can be any input like a string or an input stream and the second parameter is a pointer to your SAX interface.\n\nNote the `sax_parse` function only returns a `bool` indicating the result of the last executed SAX event. It does not return a  `json` value - it is up to you to decide what to do with the SAX events. Furthermore, no exceptions are thrown in case of a parse error -- it is up to you what to do with the exception object passed to your `parse_error` implementation. Internally, the SAX interface is used for the DOM parser (class `json_sax_dom_parser`) as well as the acceptor (`json_sax_acceptor`), see file [`json_sax.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/include/nlohmann/detail/input/json_sax.hpp).\n\n### STL-like access\n\nWe designed the JSON class to behave just like an STL container. In fact, it satisfies the [**ReversibleContainer**](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ReversibleContainer) requirement.\n\n```cpp\n// create an array using push_back\njson j;\nj.push_back(\"foo\");\nj.push_back(1);\nj.push_back(true);\n\n// also use emplace_back\nj.emplace_back(1.78);\n\n// iterate the array\nfor (json::iterator it = j.begin(); it != j.end(); ++it) {\n  std::cout << *it << '\\n';\n}\n\n// range-based for\nfor (auto& element : j) {\n  std::cout << element << '\\n';\n}\n\n// getter/setter\nconst auto tmp = j[0].get<std::string>();\nj[1] = 42;\nbool foo = j.at(2);\n\n// comparison\nj == R\"([\"foo\", 1, true, 1.78])\"_json;  // true\n\n// other stuff\nj.size();     // 4 entries\nj.empty();    // false\nj.type();     // json::value_t::array\nj.clear();    // the array is empty again\n\n// convenience type checkers\nj.is_null();\nj.is_boolean();\nj.is_number();\nj.is_object();\nj.is_array();\nj.is_string();\n\n// create an object\njson o;\no[\"foo\"] = 23;\no[\"bar\"] = false;\no[\"baz\"] = 3.141;\n\n// also use emplace\no.emplace(\"weather\", \"sunny\");\n\n// special iterator member functions for objects\nfor (json::iterator it = o.begin(); it != o.end(); ++it) {\n  std::cout << it.key() << \" : \" << it.value() << \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// the same code as range for\nfor (auto& el : o.items()) {\n  std::cout << el.key() << \" : \" << el.value() << \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// even easier with structured bindings (C++17)\nfor (auto& [key, value] : o.items()) {\n  std::cout << key << \" : \" << value << \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// find an entry\nif (o.contains(\"foo\")) {\n  // there is an entry with key \"foo\"\n}\n\n// or via find and an iterator\nif (o.find(\"foo\") != o.end()) {\n  // there is an entry with key \"foo\"\n}\n\n// or simpler using count()\nint foo_present = o.count(\"foo\"); // 1\nint fob_present = o.count(\"fob\"); // 0\n\n// delete an entry\no.erase(\"foo\");\n```\n\n### Conversion from STL containers\n\nAny sequence container (`std::array`, `std::vector`, `std::deque`, `std::forward_list`, `std::list`) whose values can be used to construct JSON values (e.g., integers, floating point numbers, Booleans, string types, or again STL containers described in this section) can be used to create a JSON array. The same holds for similar associative containers (`std::set`, `std::multiset`, `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_multiset`), but in these cases the order of the elements of the array depends on how the elements are ordered in the respective STL container.\n\n```cpp\nstd::vector<int> c_vector {1, 2, 3, 4};\njson j_vec(c_vector);\n// [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nstd::deque<double> c_deque {1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6};\njson j_deque(c_deque);\n// [1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6]\n\nstd::list<bool> c_list {true, true, false, true};\njson j_list(c_list);\n// [true, true, false, true]\n\nstd::forward_list<int64_t> c_flist {12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543};\njson j_flist(c_flist);\n// [12345678909876, 23456789098765, 34567890987654, 45678909876543]\n\nstd::array<unsigned long, 4> c_array {{1, 2, 3, 4}};\njson j_array(c_array);\n// [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nstd::set<std::string> c_set {\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"one\"};\njson j_set(c_set); // only one entry for \"one\" is used\n// [\"four\", \"one\", \"three\", \"two\"]\n\nstd::unordered_set<std::string> c_uset {\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"one\"};\njson j_uset(c_uset); // only one entry for \"one\" is used\n// maybe [\"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"one\"]\n\nstd::multiset<std::string> c_mset {\"one\", \"two\", \"one\", \"four\"};\njson j_mset(c_mset); // both entries for \"one\" are used\n// maybe [\"one\", \"two\", \"one\", \"four\"]\n\nstd::unordered_multiset<std::string> c_umset {\"one\", \"two\", \"one\", \"four\"};\njson j_umset(c_umset); // both entries for \"one\" are used\n// maybe [\"one\", \"two\", \"one\", \"four\"]\n```\n\nLikewise, any associative key-value containers (`std::map`, `std::multimap`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_multimap`) whose keys can construct an `std::string` and whose values can be used to construct JSON values (see examples above) can be used to create a JSON object. Note that in case of multimaps, only one key is used in the JSON object and the value depends on the internal order of the STL container.\n\n```cpp\nstd::map<std::string, int> c_map { {\"one\", 1}, {\"two\", 2}, {\"three\", 3} };\njson j_map(c_map);\n// {\"one\": 1, \"three\": 3, \"two\": 2 }\n\nstd::unordered_map<const char*, double> c_umap { {\"one\", 1.2}, {\"two\", 2.3}, {\"three\", 3.4} };\njson j_umap(c_umap);\n// {\"one\": 1.2, \"two\": 2.3, \"three\": 3.4}\n\nstd::multimap<std::string, bool> c_mmap { {\"one\", true}, {\"two\", true}, {\"three\", false}, {\"three\", true} };\njson j_mmap(c_mmap); // only one entry for key \"three\" is used\n// maybe {\"one\": true, \"two\": true, \"three\": true}\n\nstd::unordered_multimap<std::string, bool> c_ummap { {\"one\", true}, {\"two\", true}, {\"three\", false}, {\"three\", true} };\njson j_ummap(c_ummap); // only one entry for key \"three\" is used\n// maybe {\"one\": true, \"two\": true, \"three\": true}\n```\n\n### JSON Pointer and JSON Patch\n\nThe library supports **JSON Pointer** ([RFC 6901](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901)) as an alternative means to address structured values. On top of this, **JSON Patch** ([RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902)) allows describing differences between two JSON values -- effectively allowing patch and diff operations known from Unix.\n\n```cpp\n// a JSON value\njson j_original = R\"({\n  \"baz\": [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"],\n  \"foo\": \"bar\"\n})\"_json;\n\n// access members with a JSON pointer (RFC 6901)\nj_original[\"/baz/1\"_json_pointer];\n// \"two\"\n\n// a JSON patch (RFC 6902)\njson j_patch = R\"([\n  { \"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/baz\", \"value\": \"boo\" },\n  { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/hello\", \"value\": [\"world\"] },\n  { \"op\": \"remove\", \"path\": \"/foo\"}\n])\"_json;\n\n// apply the patch\njson j_result = j_original.patch(j_patch);\n// {\n//    \"baz\": \"boo\",\n//    \"hello\": [\"world\"]\n// }\n\n// calculate a JSON patch from two JSON values\njson::diff(j_result, j_original);\n// [\n//   { \"op\":\" replace\", \"path\": \"/baz\", \"value\": [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"] },\n//   { \"op\": \"remove\",\"path\": \"/hello\" },\n//   { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/foo\", \"value\": \"bar\" }\n// ]\n```\n\n### JSON Merge Patch\n\nThe library supports **JSON Merge Patch** ([RFC 7386](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386)) as a patch format. Instead of using JSON Pointer (see above) to specify values to be manipulated, it describes the changes using a syntax that closely mimics the document being modified.\n\n```cpp\n// a JSON value\njson j_document = R\"({\n  \"a\": \"b\",\n  \"c\": {\n    \"d\": \"e\",\n    \"f\": \"g\"\n  }\n})\"_json;\n\n// a patch\njson j_patch = R\"({\n  \"a\":\"z\",\n  \"c\": {\n    \"f\": null\n  }\n})\"_json;\n\n// apply the patch\nj_document.merge_patch(j_patch);\n// {\n//  \"a\": \"z\",\n//  \"c\": {\n//    \"d\": \"e\"\n//  }\n// }\n```\n\n### Implicit conversions\n\nSupported types can be implicitly converted to JSON values.\n\nIt is recommended to **NOT USE** implicit conversions **FROM** a JSON value.\nYou can find more details about this recommendation [here](https://www.github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/958).\nYou can switch off implicit conversions by defining `JSON_USE_IMPLICIT_CONVERSIONS` to `0` before including the `json.hpp` header. When using CMake, you can also achieve this by setting the option `JSON_ImplicitConversions` to `OFF`.\n\n```cpp\n// strings\nstd::string s1 = \"Hello, world!\";\njson js = s1;\nauto s2 = js.get<std::string>();\n// NOT RECOMMENDED\nstd::string s3 = js;\nstd::string s4;\ns4 = js;\n\n// Booleans\nbool b1 = true;\njson jb = b1;\nauto b2 = jb.get<bool>();\n// NOT RECOMMENDED\nbool b3 = jb;\nbool b4;\nb4 = jb;\n\n// numbers\nint i = 42;\njson jn = i;\nauto f = jn.get<double>();\n// NOT RECOMMENDED\ndouble f2 = jb;\ndouble f3;\nf3 = jb;\n\n// etc.\n```\n\nNote that `char` types are not automatically converted to JSON strings, but to integer numbers. A conversion to a string must be specified explicitly:\n\n```cpp\nchar ch = 'A';                       // ASCII value 65\njson j_default = ch;                 // stores integer number 65\njson j_string = std::string(1, ch);  // stores string \"A\"\n```\n\n### Arbitrary types conversions\n\nEvery type can be serialized in JSON, not just STL containers and scalar types. Usually, you would do something along those lines:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace ns {\n    // a simple struct to model a person\n    struct person {\n        std::string name;\n        std::string address;\n        int age;\n    };\n}\n\nns::person p = {\"Ned Flanders\", \"744 Evergreen Terrace\", 60};\n\n// convert to JSON: copy each value into the JSON object\njson j;\nj[\"name\"] = p.name;\nj[\"address\"] = p.address;\nj[\"age\"] = p.age;\n\n// ...\n\n// convert from JSON: copy each value from the JSON object\nns::person p {\n    j[\"name\"].get<std::string>(),\n    j[\"address\"].get<std::string>(),\n    j[\"age\"].get<int>()\n};\n```\n\nIt works, but that's quite a lot of boilerplate... Fortunately, there's a better way:\n\n```cpp\n// create a person\nns::person p {\"Ned Flanders\", \"744 Evergreen Terrace\", 60};\n\n// conversion: person -> json\njson j = p;\n\nstd::cout << j << std::endl;\n// {\"address\":\"744 Evergreen Terrace\",\"age\":60,\"name\":\"Ned Flanders\"}\n\n// conversion: json -> person\nauto p2 = j.get<ns::person>();\n\n// that's it\nassert(p == p2);\n```\n\n#### Basic usage\n\nTo make this work with one of your types, you only need to provide two functions:\n\n```cpp\nusing json = nlohmann::json;\n\nnamespace ns {\n    void to_json(json& j, const person& p) {\n        j = json{{\"name\", p.name}, {\"address\", p.address}, {\"age\", p.age}};\n    }\n\n    void from_json(const json& j, person& p) {\n        j.at(\"name\").get_to(p.name);\n        j.at(\"address\").get_to(p.address);\n        j.at(\"age\").get_to(p.age);\n    }\n} // namespace ns\n```\n\nThat's all! When calling the `json` constructor with your type, your custom `to_json` method will be automatically called.\nLikewise, when calling `get<your_type>()` or `get_to(your_type&)`, the `from_json` method will be called.\n\nSome important things:\n\n- Those methods **MUST** be in your type's namespace (which can be the global namespace), or the library will not be able to locate them (in this example, they are in namespace `ns`, where `person` is defined).\n- Those methods **MUST** be available (e.g., proper headers must be included) everywhere you use these conversions. Look at [issue 1108](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/1108) for errors that may occur otherwise.\n- When using `get<your_type>()`, `your_type` **MUST** be [DefaultConstructible](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/DefaultConstructible). (There is a way to bypass this requirement described later.)\n- In function `from_json`, use function [`at()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/at/) to access the object values rather than `operator[]`. In case a key does not exist, `at` throws an exception that you can handle, whereas `operator[]` exhibits undefined behavior.\n- You do not need to add serializers or deserializers for STL types like `std::vector`: the library already implements these.\n\n#### Simplify your life with macros\n\nIf you just want to serialize/deserialize some structs, the `to_json`/`from_json` functions can be a lot of boilerplate. There are [**several macros**](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/arbitrary_types/#simplify-your-life-with-macros) to make your life easier as long as you (1) want to use a JSON object as serialization and (2) want to use the member variable names as object keys in that object.\n\nWhich macro to choose depends on whether private member variables need to be accessed, a deserialization is needed, missing values should yield an error or should be replaced by default values, and if derived classes are used. See [this overview to choose the right one for your use case](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/macros/#serializationdeserialization-macros).\n\n##### Example usage of macros\n\nThe `to_json`/`from_json` functions for the `person` struct above can be created with [`NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_NON_INTRUSIVE`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/macros/nlohmann_define_type_non_intrusive/). In all macros, the first parameter is the name of the class/struct, and all remaining parameters name the members.\n\n```cpp\nnamespace ns {\n    NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_NON_INTRUSIVE(person, name, address, age)\n}\n```\n\nHere is another example with private members, where [`NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_INTRUSIVE`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/macros/nlohmann_define_type_intrusive/) is needed:\n\n```cpp\nnamespace ns {\n    class address {\n      private:\n        std::string street;\n        int housenumber;\n        int postcode;\n  \n      public:\n        NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_INTRUSIVE(address, street, housenumber, postcode)\n    };\n}\n```\n\n#### How do I convert third-party types?\n\nThis requires a bit more advanced technique. But first, let's see how this conversion mechanism works:\n\nThe library uses **JSON Serializers** to convert types to JSON.\nThe default serializer for `nlohmann::json` is `nlohmann::adl_serializer` (ADL means [Argument-Dependent Lookup](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl)).\n\nIt is implemented like this (simplified):\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename T>\nstruct adl_serializer {\n    static void to_json(json& j, const T& value) {\n        // calls the \"to_json\" method in T's namespace\n    }\n\n    static void from_json(const json& j, T& value) {\n        // same thing, but with the \"from_json\" method\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThis serializer works fine when you have control over the type's namespace. However, what about `boost::optional` or `std::filesystem::path` (C++17)? Hijacking the `boost` namespace is pretty bad, and it's illegal to add something other than template specializations to `std`...\n\nTo solve this, you need to add a specialization of `adl_serializer` to the `nlohmann` namespace, here's an example:\n\n```cpp\n// partial specialization (full specialization works too)\nnamespace nlohmann {\n    template <typename T>\n    struct adl_serializer<boost::optional<T>> {\n        static void to_json(json& j, const boost::optional<T>& opt) {\n            if (opt == boost::none) {\n                j = nullptr;\n            } else {\n              j = *opt; // this will call adl_serializer<T>::to_json which will\n                        // find the free function to_json in T's namespace!\n            }\n        }\n\n        static void from_json(const json& j, boost::optional<T>& opt) {\n            if (j.is_null()) {\n                opt = boost::none;\n            } else {\n                opt = j.get<T>(); // same as above, but with\n                                  // adl_serializer<T>::from_json\n            }\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n\n#### How can I use `get()` for non-default constructible/non-copyable types?\n\nThere is a way if your type is [MoveConstructible](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/MoveConstructible). You will need to specialize the `adl_serializer` as well, but with a special `from_json` overload:\n\n```cpp\nstruct move_only_type {\n    move_only_type() = delete;\n    move_only_type(int ii): i(ii) {}\n    move_only_type(const move_only_type&) = delete;\n    move_only_type(move_only_type&&) = default;\n\n    int i;\n};\n\nnamespace nlohmann {\n    template <>\n    struct adl_serializer<move_only_type> {\n        // note: the return type is no longer 'void', and the method only takes\n        // one argument\n        static move_only_type from_json(const json& j) {\n            return {j.get<int>()};\n        }\n\n        // Here's the catch! You must provide a to_json method! Otherwise, you\n        // will not be able to convert move_only_type to json, since you fully\n        // specialized adl_serializer on that type\n        static void to_json(json& j, move_only_type t) {\n            j = t.i;\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n\n#### Can I write my own serializer? (Advanced use)\n\nYes. You might want to take a look at [`unit-udt.cpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/tests/src/unit-udt.cpp) in the test suite, to see a few examples.\n\nIf you write your own serializer, you'll need to do a few things:\n\n- use a different `basic_json` alias than `nlohmann::json` (the last template parameter of `basic_json` is the `JSONSerializer`)\n- use your `basic_json` alias (or a template parameter) in all your `to_json`/`from_json` methods\n- use `nlohmann::to_json` and `nlohmann::from_json` when you need ADL\n\nHere is an example, without simplifications, that only accepts types with a size <= 32, and uses ADL.\n\n```cpp\n// You should use void as a second template argument\n// if you don't need compile-time checks on T\ntemplate<typename T, typename SFINAE = typename std::enable_if<sizeof(T) <= 32>::type>\nstruct less_than_32_serializer {\n    template <typename BasicJsonType>\n    static void to_json(BasicJsonType& j, T value) {\n        // we want to use ADL, and call the correct to_json overload\n        using nlohmann::to_json; // this method is called by adl_serializer,\n                                 // this is where the magic happens\n        to_json(j, value);\n    }\n\n    template <typename BasicJsonType>\n    static void from_json(const BasicJsonType& j, T& value) {\n        // same thing here\n        using nlohmann::from_json;\n        from_json(j, value);\n    }\n};\n```\n\nBe **very** careful when reimplementing your serializer, you can stack overflow if you don't pay attention:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate <typename T, void>\nstruct bad_serializer\n{\n    template <typename BasicJsonType>\n    static void to_json(BasicJsonType& j, const T& value) {\n      // this calls BasicJsonType::json_serializer<T>::to_json(j, value)\n      // if BasicJsonType::json_serializer == bad_serializer ... oops!\n      j = value;\n    }\n\n    template <typename BasicJsonType>\n    static void to_json(const BasicJsonType& j, T& value) {\n      // this calls BasicJsonType::json_serializer<T>::from_json(j, value)\n      // if BasicJsonType::json_serializer == bad_serializer ... oops!\n      value = j.get<T>(); // oops!\n    }\n};\n```\n\n### Specializing enum conversion\n\nBy default, enum values are serialized to JSON as integers. In some cases, this could result in undesired behavior. If an enum is modified or re-ordered after data has been serialized to JSON, the later deserialized JSON data may be undefined or a different enum value than was originally intended.\n\nIt is possible to more precisely specify how a given enum is mapped to and from JSON as shown below:\n\n```cpp\n// example enum type declaration\nenum TaskState {\n    TS_STOPPED,\n    TS_RUNNING,\n    TS_COMPLETED,\n    TS_INVALID=-1,\n};\n\n// map TaskState values to JSON as strings\nNLOHMANN_JSON_SERIALIZE_ENUM( TaskState, {\n    {TS_INVALID, nullptr},\n    {TS_STOPPED, \"stopped\"},\n    {TS_RUNNING, \"running\"},\n    {TS_COMPLETED, \"completed\"},\n})\n```\n\nThe `NLOHMANN_JSON_SERIALIZE_ENUM()` macro declares a set of `to_json()` / `from_json()` functions for type `TaskState` while avoiding repetition and boilerplate serialization code.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```cpp\n// enum to JSON as string\njson j = TS_STOPPED;\nassert(j == \"stopped\");\n\n// json string to enum\njson j3 = \"running\";\nassert(j3.get<TaskState>() == TS_RUNNING);\n\n// undefined json value to enum (where the first map entry above is the default)\njson jPi = 3.14;\nassert(jPi.get<TaskState>() == TS_INVALID);\n```\n\nJust as in [Arbitrary Type Conversions](#arbitrary-types-conversions) above,\n\n- `NLOHMANN_JSON_SERIALIZE_ENUM()` MUST be declared in your enum type's namespace (which can be the global namespace), or the library will not be able to locate it, and it will default to integer serialization.\n- It MUST be available (e.g., proper headers must be included) everywhere you use the conversions.\n\nOther Important points:\n\n- When using `get<ENUM_TYPE>()`, undefined JSON values will default to the first pair specified in your map. Select this default pair carefully.\n- If an enum or JSON value is specified more than once in your map, the first matching occurrence from the top of the map will be returned when converting to or from JSON.\n\n### Binary formats (BSON, CBOR, MessagePack, UBJSON, and BJData)\n\nThough JSON is a ubiquitous data format, it is not a very compact format suitable for data exchange, for instance over a network. Hence, the library supports [BSON](https://bsonspec.org) (Binary JSON), [CBOR](https://cbor.io) (Concise Binary Object Representation), [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org), [UBJSON](https://ubjson.org) (Universal Binary JSON Specification) and [BJData](https://neurojson.org/bjdata) (Binary JData) to efficiently encode JSON values to byte vectors and to decode such vectors.\n\n```cpp\n// create a JSON value\njson j = R\"({\"compact\": true, \"schema\": 0})\"_json;\n\n// serialize to BSON\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v_bson = json::to_bson(j);\n\n// 0x1B, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x08, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0x00, 0x01, 0x10, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00\n\n// roundtrip\njson j_from_bson = json::from_bson(v_bson);\n\n// serialize to CBOR\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v_cbor = json::to_cbor(j);\n\n// 0xA2, 0x67, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0xF5, 0x66, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x00\n\n// roundtrip\njson j_from_cbor = json::from_cbor(v_cbor);\n\n// serialize to MessagePack\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v_msgpack = json::to_msgpack(j);\n\n// 0x82, 0xA7, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0xC3, 0xA6, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x00\n\n// roundtrip\njson j_from_msgpack = json::from_msgpack(v_msgpack);\n\n// serialize to UBJSON\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v_ubjson = json::to_ubjson(j);\n\n// 0x7B, 0x69, 0x07, 0x63, 0x6F, 0x6D, 0x70, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0x54, 0x69, 0x06, 0x73, 0x63, 0x68, 0x65, 0x6D, 0x61, 0x69, 0x00, 0x7D\n\n// roundtrip\njson j_from_ubjson = json::from_ubjson(v_ubjson);\n```\n\nThe library also supports binary types from BSON, CBOR (byte strings), and MessagePack (bin, ext, fixext). They are stored by default as `std::vector<std::uint8_t>` to be processed outside the library.\n\n```cpp\n// CBOR byte string with payload 0xCAFE\nstd::vector<std::uint8_t> v = {0x42, 0xCA, 0xFE};\n\n// read value\njson j = json::from_cbor(v);\n\n// the JSON value has type binary\nj.is_binary(); // true\n\n// get reference to stored binary value\nauto& binary = j.get_binary();\n\n// the binary value has no subtype (CBOR has no binary subtypes)\nbinary.has_subtype(); // false\n\n// access std::vector<std::uint8_t> member functions\nbinary.size(); // 2\nbinary[0]; // 0xCA\nbinary[1]; // 0xFE\n\n// set subtype to 0x10\nbinary.set_subtype(0x10);\n\n// serialize to MessagePack\nauto cbor = json::to_msgpack(j); // 0xD5 (fixext2), 0x10, 0xCA, 0xFE\n```\n\n## Customers\n\nThe library is used in multiple projects, applications, operating systems, etc. The list below is not exhaustive, but the result of an internet search. If you know further customers of the library, please let me know, see [contact](#contact).\n\n[![logos of customers using the library](docs/mkdocs/docs/images/customers.png)](https://json.nlohmann.me/home/customers/)\n\n## Supported compilers\n\nThough it's 2026 already, the support for C++11 is still a bit sparse. Currently, the following compilers are known to work:\n\n- GCC 4.8 - 14.2 (and possibly later)\n- Clang 3.4 - 21.0 (and possibly later)\n- Apple Clang 9.1 - 16.0 (and possibly later)\n- Intel C++ Compiler 17.0.2 (and possibly later)\n- Nvidia CUDA Compiler 11.0.221 (and possibly later)\n- Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 / Build Tools 14.0.25123.0 (and possibly later)\n- Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 / Build Tools 15.5.180.51428 (and possibly later)\n- Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 / Build Tools 16.3.1+1def00d3d (and possibly later)\n- Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 / Build Tools 19.30.30709.0 (and possibly later)\n\nI would be happy to learn about other compilers/versions.\n\nPlease note:\n\n- GCC 4.8 has a bug [57824](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57824): multiline raw strings cannot be the arguments to macros. Don't use multiline raw strings directly in macros with this compiler.\n- Android defaults to using very old compilers and C++ libraries. To fix this, add the following to your `Application.mk`. This will switch to the LLVM C++ library, the Clang compiler, and enable C++11 and other features disabled by default.\n\n    ```makefile\n    APP_STL := c++_shared\n    NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION := clang3.6\n    APP_CPPFLAGS += -frtti -fexceptions\n    ```\n\n    The code compiles successfully with [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html?hl=ml), Revision 9 - 11 (and possibly later) and [CrystaX's Android NDK](https://www.crystax.net/en/android/ndk) version 10.\n\n- For GCC running on MinGW or Android SDK, the error `'to_string' is not a member of 'std'` (or similarly, for `strtod` or `strtof`) may occur. Note this is not an issue with the code, but rather with the compiler itself. On Android, see above to build with a newer environment.  For MinGW, please refer to [this site](https://tehsausage.com/mingw-to-string) and [this discussion](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/136) for information on how to fix this bug. For Android NDK using `APP_STL := gnustl_static`, please refer to [this discussion](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/219).\n\n- Unsupported versions of GCC and Clang are rejected by `#error` directives. This can be switched off by defining `JSON_SKIP_UNSUPPORTED_COMPILER_CHECK`. Note that you can expect no support in this case.\n\nSee the page [quality assurance](https://json.nlohmann.me/community/quality_assurance) on the compilers used to check the library in the CI.\n\n## Integration\n\n[`json.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp) is the single required file in `single_include/nlohmann` or [released here](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases). You need to add\n\n```cpp\n#include <nlohmann/json.hpp>\n\n// for convenience\nusing json = nlohmann::json;\n```\n\nto the files you want to process JSON and set the necessary switches to enable C++11 (e.g., `-std=c++11` for GCC and Clang).\n\nYou can further use file [`include/nlohmann/json_fwd.hpp`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/include/nlohmann/json_fwd.hpp) for forward-declarations. The installation of `json_fwd.hpp` (as part of cmake's install step) can be achieved by setting `-DJSON_MultipleHeaders=ON`.\n\n### CMake\n\nYou can also use the `nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json` interface target in CMake.  This target populates the appropriate usage requirements for `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` to point to the appropriate include directories and `INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES` for the necessary C++11 flags.\n\n#### External\n\nTo use this library from a CMake project, you can locate it directly with `find_package()` and use the namespaced imported target from the generated package configuration:\n\n```cmake\n# CMakeLists.txt\nfind_package(nlohmann_json 3.12.0 REQUIRED)\n...\nadd_library(foo ...)\n...\ntarget_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)\n```\n\nThe package configuration file, `nlohmann_jsonConfig.cmake`, can be used either from an install tree or directly out of the build tree.\n\n#### Embedded\n\nTo embed the library directly into an existing CMake project, place the entire source tree in a subdirectory and call `add_subdirectory()` in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:\n\n```cmake\n# Typically you don't care so much for a third party library's tests to be\n# run from your own project's code.\nset(JSON_BuildTests OFF CACHE INTERNAL \"\")\n\n# If you only include this third party in PRIVATE source files, you do not\n# need to install it when your main project gets installed.\n# set(JSON_Install OFF CACHE INTERNAL \"\")\n\n# Don't use include(nlohmann_json/CMakeLists.txt) since that carries with it\n# unintended consequences that will break the build.  It's generally\n# discouraged (although not necessarily well documented as such) to use\n# include(...) for pulling in other CMake projects anyways.\nadd_subdirectory(nlohmann_json)\n...\nadd_library(foo ...)\n...\ntarget_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)\n```\n\n##### Embedded (FetchContent)\n\nSince CMake v3.11,\n[FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/module/FetchContent.html) can\nbe used to automatically download a release as a dependency at configure time.\n\nExample:\n\n```cmake\ninclude(FetchContent)\n\nFetchContent_Declare(json URL https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases/download/v3.12.0/json.tar.xz)\nFetchContent_MakeAvailable(json)\n\ntarget_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)\n```\n\n**Note**: It is recommended to use the URL approach described above, which is supported as of version 3.10.0. See\n<https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/cmake/#fetchcontent> for more information.\n\n#### Supporting Both\n\nTo allow your project to support either an externally supplied or an embedded JSON library, you can use a pattern akin to the following:\n\n``` cmake\n# Top level CMakeLists.txt\nproject(FOO)\n...\noption(FOO_USE_EXTERNAL_JSON \"Use an external JSON library\" OFF)\n...\nadd_subdirectory(thirdparty)\n...\nadd_library(foo ...)\n...\n# Note that the namespaced target will always be available regardless of the\n# import method\ntarget_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)\n```\n\n```cmake\n# thirdparty/CMakeLists.txt\n...\nif(FOO_USE_EXTERNAL_JSON)\n  find_package(nlohmann_json 3.12.0 REQUIRED)\nelse()\n  set(JSON_BuildTests OFF CACHE INTERNAL \"\")\n  add_subdirectory(nlohmann_json)\nendif()\n...\n```\n\n`thirdparty/nlohmann_json` is then a complete copy of this source tree.\n\n### Package Managers\n\nUse your favorite [**package manager**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/) to use the library.\n\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/homebrew.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**Homebrew**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#homebrew) `nlohmann-json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/meson.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**Meson**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#meson) `nlohmann_json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/bazel.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**Bazel**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#bazel) `nlohmann_json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/conan.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**Conan**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#conan) `nlohmann_json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/spack.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**Spack**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#spack) `nlohmann-json`\n- [**Hunter**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#hunter) `nlohmann_json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/vcpkg.png\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**vcpkg**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#vcpkg) `nlohmann-json`\n- [**cget**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#cget) `nlohmann/json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/swift.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**Swift Package Manager**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#swift-package-manager) `nlohmann/json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/nuget.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**Nuget**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#nuget) `nlohmann.json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/conda.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**Conda**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#conda) `nlohmann_json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/macports.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**MacPorts**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#macports) `nlohmann-json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/CPM.png\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**cpm.cmake**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#cpmcmake) `gh:nlohmann/json`\n- <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/refs/heads/develop/docs/mkdocs/docs/images/package_managers/xmake.svg\" height=\"20\">&nbsp;[**xmake**](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#xmake) `nlohmann_json`\n\nThe library is part of many package managers.

These encodings are not supported when reading from files or other input containers.\n- Other encodings such as Latin-1 or ISO 8859-1 are **not** supported and will yield parse or serialization errors.\n- [Unicode noncharacters](https://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html#nonchar1) will not be replaced by the library.\n- Invalid surrogates (e.g., incomplete pairs such as `\\uDEAD`) will yield parse errors.\n- The strings stored in the library are UTF-8 encoded. When using the default string type (`std::string`), note that its length/size functions return the number of stored bytes rather than the number of characters or glyphs.\n- When you store strings with different encodings in the library, calling [`dump()`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/dump/) may throw an exception unless `json::error_handler_t::replace` or `json::error_handler_t::ignore` are used as error handlers.\n- To store wide strings (e.g., `std::wstring`), you need to convert them to a UTF-8 encoded `std::string` before, see [an example](https://json.nlohmann.me/home/faq/#wide-string-handling).\n\n### Comments in JSON\n\nThis library does not support comments by default. It does so for three reasons:\n\n1. Comments are not part of the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259). You may argue that `//` or `/* */` are allowed in JavaScript, but JSON is not JavaScript.\n2. This was not an oversight: Douglas Crockford [wrote on this](https://plus.google.com/118095276221607585885/posts/RK8qyGVaGSr) in May 2012:\n  \n    > I removed comments from JSON because I saw people were using them to hold parsing directives, a practice which would have destroyed interoperability.  I know that the lack of comments makes some people sad, but it shouldn't.\n    >\n    > Suppose you are using JSON to keep configuration files, which you would like to annotate. Go ahead and insert all the comments you like. Then pipe it through JSMin before handing it to your JSON parser.\n  \n3. It is dangerous for interoperability if some libraries would add comment support while others don't. Please check [The Harmful Consequences of the Robustness Principle](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-iab-protocol-maintenance-01) on this.\n\nHowever, you can set set parameter `ignore_comments` to true in the `parse` function to ignore `//` or `/* */` comments. Comments will then be treated as whitespace.\n\n### Trailing commas\n\nThe JSON specification does not allow trailing commas in arrays and objects, and hence this library is treating them as parsing errors by default.\n\nLike comments, you can set parameter `ignore_trailing_commas` to true in the `parse` function to ignore trailing commas in arrays and objects. Note that a single comma as the only content of the array or object (`[,]` or `{,}`) is not allowed, and multiple trailing commas (`[1,,]`) are not allowed either.\n\nThis library does not add trailing commas when serializing JSON data.\n\nFor more information, see [JSON With Commas and Comments (JWCC)](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2021/json-with-commas-comments.html).\n\n### Order of object keys\n\nBy default, the library does not preserve the **insertion order of object elements**. This is standards-compliant, as the [JSON standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.html) defines objects as \"an unordered collection of zero or more name/value pairs\".\n\nIf you do want to preserve the insertion order, you can try the type [`nlohmann::ordered_json`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/2179). Alternatively, you can use a more sophisticated ordered map like [`tsl::ordered_map`](https://github.com/Tessil/ordered-map) ([integration](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/546#issuecomment-304447518)) or [`nlohmann::fifo_map`](https://github.com/nlohmann/fifo_map) ([integration](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/485#issuecomment-333652309)).\n\nSee the [**documentation on object order**](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/object_order/) for more information.\n\n### Memory Release\n\nWe checked with Valgrind and the Address Sanitizer (ASAN) that there are no memory leaks.\n\nIf you find that a parsing program with this library does not release memory, please consider the following case, and it may be unrelated to this library.\n\n**Your program is compiled with glibc.** There is a tunable threshold that glibc uses to decide whether to actually return memory to the system or whether to cache it for later reuse. If in your program you make lots of small allocations and those small allocations are not a contiguous block and are presumably below the threshold, then they will not get returned to the OS.\nHere is a related issue [#1924](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/1924).\n\n### Further notes\n\n- The code contains numerous debug **assertions** which can be switched off by defining the preprocessor macro `NDEBUG`, see the [documentation of `assert`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert). In particular, note [`operator[]`](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/operator%5B%5D/) implements **unchecked access** for const objects: If the given key is not present, the behavior is undefined (think of a dereferenced null pointer) and yields an [assertion failure](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/289) if assertions are switched on. If you are not sure whether an element in an object exists, use checked access with the [`at()` function](https://json.nlohmann.me/api/basic_json/at/). Furthermore, you can define `JSON_ASSERT(x)` to replace calls to `assert(x)`. See the [**documentation on runtime assertions**](https://json.nlohmann.me/features/assertions/) for more information.\n- As the exact number type is not defined in the [JSON specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259.html), this library tries to choose the best fitting C++ number type automatically. As a result, the type `double` may be used to store numbers which may yield [**floating-point exceptions**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/181) in certain rare situations if floating-point exceptions have been unmasked in the calling code. These exceptions are not caused by the library and need to be fixed in the calling code, such as by re-masking the exceptions prior to calling library functions.\n- The code can be compiled without C++ **runtime type identification** features; that is, you can use the `-fno-rtti` compiler flag.\n- **Exceptions** are used widely within the library. They can, however, be switched off with either using the compiler flag `-fno-exceptions` or by defining the symbol `JSON_NOEXCEPTION`. In this case, exceptions are replaced by `abort()` calls. You can further control this behavior by defining `JSON_THROW_USER` (overriding `throw`), `JSON_TRY_USER` (overriding `try`), and `JSON_CATCH_USER` (overriding `catch`). Note that `JSON_THROW_USER` should leave the current scope (e.g., by throwing or aborting), as continuing after it may yield undefined behavior. Note the explanatory [`what()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/exception/what) string of exceptions is not available for MSVC if exceptions are disabled, see [#2824](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/2824). See the [**documentation of exceptions**](https://json.nlohmann.me/home/exceptions/) for more information.\n\n## Execute unit tests\n\nTo compile and run the tests, you need to execute\n\n```shell\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake .. -DJSON_BuildTests=On\ncmake --build .\nctest --output-on-failure\n```\n\nNote that during the `ctest` stage, several JSON test files are downloaded from an [external repository](https://github.com/nlohmann/json_test_data). If policies forbid downloading artifacts during testing, you can download the files yourself and pass the directory with the test files via `-DJSON_TestDataDirectory=path` to CMake. Then, no Internet connectivity is required. See [issue #2189](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/2189) for more information.\n\nIf the testdata is not found, several test suites will fail like this:\n\n```\n===============================================================================\njson/tests/src/make_test_data_available.hpp:21:\nTEST CASE:  check test suite is downloaded\n\njson/tests/src/make_test_data_available.hpp:23: FATAL ERROR: REQUIRE( utils::check_testsuite_downloaded() ) is NOT correct!\n  values: REQUIRE( false )\n  logged: Test data not found in 'json/cmake-build-debug/json_test_data'.\n          Please execute target 'download_test_data' before running this test suite.\n          See <https://github.com/nlohmann/json#execute-unit-tests> for more information.\n\n===============================================================================\n```\n\nIn case you have downloaded the library rather than checked out the code via Git, test `cmake_fetch_content_configure` will fail. Please execute `ctest -LE git_required` to skip these tests. See [issue #2189](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/2189) for more information.\n\nSome tests are requiring network to be properly execute. They are labeled as `git_required`. Please execute `ctest -LE git_required` to skip these tests. See [issue #4851](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/4851) for more information.\n\nSome tests change the installed files and hence make the whole process not reproducible. Please execute `ctest -LE not_reproducible` to skip these tests. See [issue #2324](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/2324) for more information. Furthermore, assertions must be switched off to ensure reproducible builds (see [discussion 4494](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/4494)).\n\nNote you need to call `cmake -LE \"not_reproducible|git_required\"` to exclude both labels. See [issue #2596](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/2596) for more information.\n\nAs Intel compilers use unsafe floating point optimization by default, the unit tests may fail. Use flag [`/fp:precise`](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/cpp-compiler/developer-guide-reference/2021-8/fp-model-fp.html) then.\n",

      "readme": "# `container`\n\n`container` is a tool that you can use to create and run Linux containers as lightweight virtual machines on your Mac. It's written in Swift, and optimized for Apple silicon.\n\nThe tool consumes and produces [OCI-compatible container images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec), so you can pull and run images from any standard container registry. You can push images that you build to those registries as well, and run the images in any other OCI-compatible application.\n\n`container` uses the [Containerization](https://github.com/apple/containerization) Swift package for low level container, image, and process management.\n\n![introductory movie showing some basic commands](./docs/assets/landing-movie.gif)\n\n## Get started\n\n### Requirements\n\nYou need a Mac with Apple silicon to run `container`. To build it, see the [BUILDING](./BUILDING.md) document.\n\n`container` is supported on macOS 26, since it takes advantage of new features and enhancements to virtualization and networking in this release. We do not support older versions of macOS and the `container` maintainers typically will not address issues that cannot be reproduced on the macOS 26.\n\n### Install or upgrade\n\nIf you're upgrading, first stop and uninstall your existing `container` (the `-k` flag keeps your user data, while `-d` removes it):\n\n```bash\ncontainer system stop\n/usr/local/bin/uninstall-container.sh -k\n```\n\nDownload the latest signed installer package for `container` from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/apple/container/releases).\n\nTo install the tool, double-click the package file and follow the instructions. Enter your administrator password when prompted, to give the installer permission to place the installed files under `/usr/local`.\n\nStart the system service with:\n\n```bash\ncontainer system start\n```\n\n### Uninstall\n\nUse the `uninstall-container.sh` script (installed to `/usr/local/bin`) to remove `container` from your system. To remove your user data along with the tool, run:\n\n```bash\n/usr/local/bin/uninstall-container.sh -d\n```\n\nTo retain your user data so that it is available should you reinstall later, run:\n\n```bash\n/usr/local/bin/uninstall-container.sh -k\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n- Take [a guided tour of `container`](./docs/tutorial.md) by building, running, and publishing a simple web server image.\n- Learn how to [use various `container` features](./docs/how-to.md).\n- Read a brief description and [technical overview](./docs/technical-overview.md) of `container`.\n- Browse the [full command reference](./docs/command-reference.md).\n- [Build and run](./BUILDING.md) `container` on your own development system.\n- View the project [API documentation](https://apple.github.io/container/documentation/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to `container` are welcomed and encouraged. Please see our [main contributing guide](https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n\n## Project Status\n\nThe container project is currently under active development. Its stability, both for consuming the project as a Swift package and the `container` tool, is only guaranteed within patch versions, such as between 0.1.1 and 0.1.2. Minor version number releases may include breaking changes until we achieve a 1.0.0 release.\n",

release\n多模态知识管理平台是一款面向多模态非结构化知识的RAG解决方案，集成解析、检索与生成能力，能够高效处理复杂文档，为智能问答与内容生成提供一站式支持。\n\n[**<font color=red>多模态知识管理：面向多模态文档的综合性RAG平台，为复杂文档的智能问答与内容生成提供一站式解决方案。</font>**](README_mrag.md)\n（注意使用mrag分支）\n![](./docs/img/mrag/mrag_struct.png)\n\n企业内部知识主要包括结构化表格知识和非结构化知识。因此对于结构化表格知识建设了开箱即用的DataAgent能力，主要包括数据治理DGP协议、智能问数和智能诊断分析。\n\n[**<font

src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a449185-4863-4171-8dda-72cb70b2fa91\" />\n\n## 简介\n\n当前相关开源agent主要是SDK或者框架，用户还需基于此做进一步的开发，无法直接做到开箱即用。我们开源的JoyAgent-JDGenie是端到端的多Agent产品，对于输入的query或者任务，可以直接回答或者解决。例如用户query\"给我做一个最近美元和黄金的走势分析\"，JoyAgent-Genie可以直接给出网页版或者PPT版的报告文档。\n\nJoyAgent-JDGenie是一个通用的多智能体框架，对于用户需要定制的一些新场景功能，只需将相关的子智能体或者工具挂载到JoyAgent-Genie即可。为了验证JoyAgent-JDGenie的通用性，在GAIA榜单Validation集准确率**75.15%、**Test集**65.12%**，已超越OWL（CAMEL）、Smolagent（Huggingface）、LRC-Huawei（Huawei）、xManus（OpenManus）、AutoAgent（香港大学）等行业知名产品。\n\n此外，我们的开源多智能体产品JoyAgent-JDGenie相对比较轻量，不像阿里的SpringAI-Alibaba需要依赖阿里云百炼平台相关功能（基于百炼平台调用LLM），Coze依赖火山引擎平台。\n\n我们整体开源了智能体产品JoyAgent-JDGenie，包括前端、后端、框架、引擎、核心子智能体（报告生成智能体、代码智能体、PPT智能体、文件智能体等）、想用微调后效果更好的欢迎使用JoyAgent。\n##

genie-backend/src/main/resources/application.yml中 base_url、apikey、model、max_tokens、model_name等配置\n使用DeepSeek时: 注意deepseek-chat 为max_tokens: 8192\n\n手动更新 genie-tool/.env_template 中的 OPENAI_API_KEY、OPENAI_BASE_URL、DEFAULT_MODEL、SERPER_SEARCH_API_KEY\n使用DeepSeek时: 设置DEEPSEEK_API_KEY、DEEPSEEK_API_BASE，DEFAULT_MODEL 设置为 deepseek/deepseek-chat，所有 ${DEFAULT_MODEL} 也都改成deepseek/deepseek-chat\n\n3. 编译dockerfile\ndocker build -t genie:latest .\n\n4. 启动dockerfile\ndocker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 -p 1601:1601 --name genie-app genie:latest\n\n5. 浏览器输入 localhost:3000 访问genie\n```\n如果部署遇到问题，可以参考视频:【5分钟使用deepseek启动开源智能体应用joyagent-genie-哔哩哔哩】 https://b23.tv/8VQDBOK\n\n### 方式2: 手动初始化环境，启动服务\n\n#### 环境准备\n- jdk17\n- python3.11\n- python环境准备\n  - pip install uv\n  - cd genie-tool\n  - uv sync\n  - source .venv/bin/activate\n\n#### 方案1：手动step by step部署手册\n手动超详细攻略参考 [Step by Step](./Deploy.md)\n\n#### 方案2：手动一键启动部署（推荐）\n\n直接通过shell启动所有服务\n```\nsh check_dep_port.sh # 检查所有依赖和端口占用情况\nsh Genie_start.sh  # 直接启动，以后改动配置直接重启动脚本即可，control+c 一键kill所有服务\n```\n部署时可以参考视频:【joyagent-jdgenie部署演示】 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Py8Yz4ELK/?vd_source=a5601a346d433a490c55293e76180c9d\n\n## 二次开发\n\n### 如何添加自己的MCP工具到JoyAgent-JDGenie中\n\n#### 配置文件\n\n在 `genie-backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` 添加mcp_server服务，多个server逗号分隔\n在 `ui/.env` 中可以修改前端请求后端的路径\n\n```yaml\nmcp_server_url: \"http://ip1:port1/sse,http://ip2:port2/sse\"\n```\n\n#### 启动服务\n\n```bash\nsh start_genie.sh\n```\n\n#### 开始对话\n\n比如添加12306工具后，规划7月7天2人从北京出发去新疆旅行计划，并查询相关火车票信息，\ngenie会进行旅行计划设计，然后调用mcp工具查询车票信息，最终输出报告。\n![img.png](./docs/img/mcp_example.png)\n\n\n### 新增自定义子Agent到JoyAgent-JDGenie中\n\n实现BaseTool接口，声明工具的名称、描述、参数、调用方法。\n\n```java\n/**\n * 工具基接口\n */\npublic interface BaseTool {\n    String getName(); // 工具名称\n    String getDescription(); // 工具描述\n    Map<String, Object> toParams(); // 工具参数\n    Object execute(Object input); // 调用工具\n}\n\n// 天气智能体示例\npublic class WeatherTool implements BaseTool {\n    @Override\n    public String getName() {\n        return \"agent_weather\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String getDescription() {\n        return \"这是一个可以查询天气的智能体\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Map<String, Object> toParams() {\n        return \"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"object\\\",\\\"properties\\\":{\\\"location\\\":{\\\"description\\\":\\\"地点\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"}},\\\"required\\\":[\\\"location\\\"]}\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Object execute(Object input) {\n        return \"今日天气晴朗\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\n在`com.jd.genie.controller.GenieController#buildToolCollection`中添加如下代码，引入自定义Agent\n\n```java\nWeatherTool weatherTool = new WeatherTool();\ntoolCollection.addTool(weatherTool);\n```\n\n#### 启动服务\n\n```bash\nsh start_genie.sh\n```\n\n\n## 项目共建者\n贡献者：Liu Shangkun,Li Xiang,[Li

      "readme": "# touchHLE: high-level emulator for iPhone OS apps\n\n**touchHLE** is a high-level emulator for iPhone OS apps. It runs on modern desktop operating systems and Android, and is written in Rust.\n\ntouchHLE's high-level emulation (HLE) approach differs from low-level emulation (LLE) in that it does not directly simulate the iPhone/iPod touch hardware. Instead of running iPhone OS inside emulation, touchHLE _itself_ takes the place of iPhone OS and provides its own implementations of the system frameworks (Foundation, UIKit, OpenGL ES, OpenAL, etc). The only code the [emulated CPU](https://github.com/merryhime/dynarmic) executes is the app binary and [a handful of libraries](touchHLE_dylibs/).\n\nThe goal of this project is to run games from the early days of iOS:\n\n* Currently: iPhone and iPod touch apps for iPhone OS 2.x and iPhone OS 3.0.\n* Longer term: iPhone OS 3.1, iPad apps (iPhone OS 3.2), iOS 4.x, …\n* [Never](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE/issues/181#issuecomment-1777098259): 64-bit iOS.\n\n**This does not mean that all apps for these OS versions work.** The vast majority of iPhone OS 2.x and iPhone OS 3.x apps do not currently work in touchHLE, and the ones that do work are generally games (support for other apps isn't a priority: it's more complex and less fun). This improves gradually over time with contributions from various developers. The [touchHLE app compatibility database](https://appdb.touchhle.org/) tracks which apps work in touchHLE; it is a crowdsourced effort to which anyone can contribute. **We don't take requests, so please do not ask us to support your favourite game.**\n\nIf you're curious about the history and motivation behind the project, you might want to read [the original announcement](https://hikari.noyu.me/blog/2023-02-06-touchhle-anouncement-thread-tech-games-me-and-passion-projects.html). For an introduction to some of the technical details, check out [_touchHLE in depth_](https://hikari.noyu.me/blog/2023-04-13-touchhle-in-depth-1-function-calls.html).\n\n**Check out the website for downloads, FAQ, social media, and more:**<br>👉 <https://touchhle.org/> 👈\n\n## Important disclaimer\n\nThis project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc in any way. iPhone, iOS, iPod, iPod touch and iPad are trademarks of Apple Inc in the United States and other countries.\n\nOnly use touchHLE to emulate software you have obtained legally.\n\n## Platform support\n\n* Officially supported: x64 Windows, x64 macOS and AArch64 Android.\n  * These are the platforms with binary releases.\n  * If you're an Apple Silicon Mac user, the x64 build reportedly works in Rosetta.\n* Probably works, but you must build it yourself: AArch64 macOS, x64 Linux, AArch64 Linux.\n* Never?: other architectures.\n\nInput methods:\n\n- For simulated touch input, there are four options:\n  - Mouse/trackpad input (tap/hold/drag by pressing the left mouse button)\n  - Virtual cursor using a game controller (move the cursor with the right analog stick, and tap/hold/drag by pressing the stick or the right shoulder button)\n  - Mapping of game controller buttons or the left analog stick to specific on-screen locations (see the descriptions of `--button-to-touch=`, `--dpad-to-touch=` and `--stick-to-touch=` in `OPTIONS_HELP.txt`)\n  - Real touch input, if you're on a device that has a touch screen\n- For simulated accelerometer input, there are three options:\n  - Tilt control simulation using the left analog stick of a game controller\n  - Tilt control simulation using a mouse (hold down the right mouse button)\n  - Real accelerometer input, if you are using a phone, tablet or some other device with a built-in accelerometer (TODO: support game controllers with accelerometers)\n\n## Development status\n\nThis project has been in development since December 2022. This was originally [hikari\\_no\\_yume](https://hikari.noyu.me/)'s full-time passion project. Since its release in February 2023, a number of other volunteers have also [contributed in their free time](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE/graphs/contributors), and this is no longer a single-person project. There's only been a handful of releases so far and no promises can be made about the future. Please be patient.\n\nIn general, the supported functionality is defined by the supported apps: most contributors are interested in getting a particular game working, and contribute support for whichever missing features are needed for that game. Consequently, the completeness varies a lot between APIs, e.g. UIKit is easily the most hacky and incomplete of the large frameworks that have been implemented, because most games don't use very much of its functionality, whereas the OpenGL ES and OpenAL implementations are probably complete enough to cover a large number of early apps, because games make heavy use of these.\n\n# Usage\n\nFirst obtain touchHLE, either a [binary release](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE/releases) or by building it yourself (see the next section).\n\nYou'll then need an app that you can run. The [app compatibility database](https://appdb.touchhle.org/) is a good guide for which versions of which apps are known to work, but bear in mind that it may contain outdated or inaccurate information. Note that the app binary must be decrypted to be usable.\n\nThere's a few ways you can run an app in touchHLE.\n\n## Special Android notes\n\nWindows, Mac and Linux users can skip this section.\n\nOn Android, only the graphical user interface (app picker) is available. Therefore, you must put your “.ipa” files or “.app” bundles inside the “touchHLE\\_apps” directory. Note that you can only do that once you have run touchHLE at least once.\n\nFile management can be tricky on Android due to [restrictions introduced by Google in newer Android versions](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage#scoped-storage). One of these methods may work:\n\n* If you tap the “File manager” button in touchHLE, this should open some sort of file manager. You might also be able to find touchHLE in your device's file manager app (often called “Files”, or sometimes “Downloads”), alongside cloud storage services. There are some limitations on what kinds of operations are possible. The files in this location are stored on your device. Warning: on some devices, the “File manager” button _will_ open a file manager, but it will crash when actually doing file operations (this is probably a bug in Android, we have not been able to debug it). If this happens to you, clear that file manager from your recent apps list and try to navigate to your device's file manager app directly instead, rather than via the touchHLE UI.\n* If you have an older version of Android, you may be able to directly access touchHLE's files by browsing to `/sdcard/Android/data/org.touchhle.android/files/touchHLE_apps`. Note that the `/sdcard` directory is usually not on the SD card.\n* You may be able to use ADB. If you're unfamiliar with ADB, try using <https://yume-chan.github.io/ya-webadb/> (in Google Chrome or another browser with WebUSB) with your device connected over USB. touchHLE's files can be found in “sdcard” > “Android” > “data” > “org.touchhle.android” > “files” > “touchHLE\\_apps”.\n\n## Graphical user interface\n\ntouchHLE has a built-in app picker. If you put your `.ipa` files and `.app` bundles in the `touchHLE_apps` directory, they will show up in the app picker when you run touchHLE.\n\nTo configure the options, you can edit the `touchHLE_options.txt` file. To get a list of options, look in the `OPTIONS_HELP.txt` file.\n\n## Command-line user interface\n\n**This section does not apply on Android.**\n\nYou can see the command-line usage by passing the `--help` flag.\n\nIf you're a Windows user and unfamiliar with the command line, these instructions may help you get started:\n\n1. Move the `.ipa` file or `.app` bundle to the same folder as `touchHLE.exe`.\n2. Hold the Shift key and right-click on the empty space in the folder window.\n3. Click “Open with PowerShell”.\n4. Type `.\\touchHLE.exe \"YourAppNameHere.ipa\"` (or `.app` as appropriate) and press Enter. If you want to specify options, add a space after the app name (outside the quotes) and then type the options, separated by spaces.\n\n## Local multiplayer support\n\ntouchHLE provides limited support for local multiplayer via Wi-Fi in some games. At the moment of writing it is supported in Asphalt 4 and N.O.V.A.\n\nReal iOS devices could also join/host games!\n\n**Usage:**\n1. Install touchHLE on 2+ devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\n2. **Important:** Ensure touchHLE is whitelisted in your OS firewall/network settings.\n3. Enable \"Network access\" in Quick options or via `--allow-network-access`.\n4. Start/join multiplayer in the game.\n\n**FAQs:**\n* **Tunneling over Internet/VPN:** Not officially supported, but might work.\n* **Bluetooth:** Not supported.\n\n**Known issues:**\n* On macOS you may need to launch touchHLE from terminal as otherwise OS will block network connections.\n\n## Other stuff\n\nAny data saved by the app (e.g. **saved games**) are stored in the `touchHLE_sandbox` folder.\n\nIf the emulator crashes almost immediately while running a **known-working** version of a game, please check whether you have any overlays turned on like the Steam overlay, Discord overlay, RivaTuner Statistics Server, etc. Sadly, as useful as these tools are, they work by injecting themselves into other apps or games and don't always clean up after themselves, so they can break touchHLE… it's not our fault. 😢 Currently only RivaTuner Statistics Server is known to be a problem. If you find another overlay that doesn't work, please tell us about it.\n\n# Building and contributing\n\nSee the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the git repo if you want to contribute. If you just want build touchHLE, look at `dev-docs/building.md`.\n\n# License\n\ntouchHLE © 2023–2026 touchHLE project contributors.\n\nThe source code of touchHLE itself (not its dependencies) is licensed under the Mozilla Public License, version 2.0.\n\nDue to license compatibility concerns, binaries are under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.\n\nFor a best effort listing of all licenses of dependencies, build touchHLE and pass the `--copyright` flag when running it, or click the “Copyright info” button in the app picker.\n\nPlease note that different licensing terms apply to the bundled dynamic libraries (in `touchHLE_dylibs/`) and fonts (in `touchHLE_fonts/`).

We want to help!\n\n* Check the {docs}/[reference documentation], especially the {docs}/how-to/index.html[How-to's] -- they provide solutions to the most common questions.\n* Learn the Spring basics -- Spring Boot builds on many other Spring projects; check the https://spring.io[spring.io] website for a wealth of reference documentation.\n  If you are new to Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].\n* If you are upgrading, read the {github}/wiki[release notes] for upgrade instructions and \"new and noteworthy\" features.\n* Ask a question -- we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-boot[`spring-boot`].\n* Report bugs with Spring Boot at {github}/issues[github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues].\n\n\n\n== Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions of all kinds!\nPlease read our link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[contribution guidelines] before submitting a pull request.\n\n\n\n== Reporting Issues\n\nSpring Boot uses GitHub's integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests.\nIf you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:\n\n* Before you log a bug, please search the {github}/issues[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.\n* If the issue doesn't already exist, {github}/issues/new[create a new issue].\n* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report.\nWe like to know the Spring Boot version, operating system, and JVM version you're using.\n* If you need to paste code or include a stack trace, use Markdown.\n+++```+++ escapes before and after your text.\n* If possible, try to create a test case or project that replicates the problem and attach it to the issue.\n\n\n\n== Building from Source\n\nYou don't need to build from source to use Spring Boot.\nIf you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Boot can be built and published to your local Maven cache using the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle wrapper].\nYou also need JDK 25.\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n$ ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal\n----\n\nThis command builds all modules and publishes them to your local Maven cache.\nIt won't run any of the tests.\nIf you want to build everything, use the `build` task:\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n$ ./gradlew build\n----\n\n\n\n== Guides\n\nThe https://spring.io/[spring.io] site contains several guides that show how to use Spring Boot step-by-step:\n\n* https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/[Building an Application with Spring Boot] is an introductory guide that shows you how to create an application, run it, and add some management services.\n* https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/[Building a RESTful Web Service with Spring Boot Actuator] is a guide to creating a REST web service and also shows how the server can be configured.\n\n\n\n== License\n\nSpring Boot is Open Source software released under the https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache 2.0 license].\n",

For example, `vercel deploy --cwd=/path/to/project` could be run with local changes with `pnpm vercel deploy --cwd=/path/to/project`.\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [Vercel Community](https://community.vercel.com/tags/c/community/4/cli) with the owners of this repository before submitting a Pull Request.\n\nPlease read our [Code of Conduct](./.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n### Local development\n\nThis project is configured in a monorepo, where one repository contains multiple npm packages. Dependencies are installed and managed with `pnpm`, not `npm` CLI.\n\nTo get started, execute the following:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/vercel/vercel\ncd vercel\ncorepack enable\npnpm install\npnpm build\npnpm lint\npnpm test-unit\n```\n\nMake sure all the tests pass before making changes.\n\n#### Running Vercel CLI Changes\n\nYou can use `pnpm vercel` from the `cli` package to invoke Vercel CLI with local changes:\n\n```\ncd ./packages/cli\npnpm vercel <cli-commands...>\n```\n\nSee [CLI Local Development](../packages/cli#local-development) for more details.\n\n### Verifying your change\n\nOnce you are done with your changes (we even suggest doing it along the way), make sure all the tests still pass by running:\n\n```\npnpm test-unit\n```\n\nfrom the root of the project.\n\nIf any test fails, make sure to fix it along with your changes. See [Interpreting test errors](#Interpreting-test-errors) for more information about how the tests are executed, especially the integration tests.\n\n### Pull Request Process\n\nOnce you are confident that your changes work properly, open a pull request on the main repository.\n\nThe pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers and the tests will be checked by our continuous integration platform.\n\n### Interpreting test errors\n\nThere are 2 kinds of tests in this repository – Unit tests and Integration tests.\n\nUnit tests are run locally with `jest` and execute quickly because they are testing the smallest units of code.\n\n#### Integration tests\n\nIntegration tests create deployments to your Vercel account using the `test` project name. After each test is deployed, the `probes` key is used to check if the response is the expected value. If the value doesn't match, you'll see a message explaining the difference. If the deployment failed to build, you'll see a more generic message like the following:\n\n```\n[Error: Fetched page https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/root.js does not contain hello Root!. Instead it contains An error occurred with this application.\n\n    NO_STATUS_CODE_FRO Response headers:\n       cache-control=s-maxage=0\n      connection=close\n      content-type=text/plain; charset=utf-8\n      date=Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:01:37 GMT\n      server=now\n      strict-transport-security=max-age=63072000\n      transfer-encoding=chunked\n      x-now-id=iad1:hgtzj-1560967297876-44ae12559f95\n      x-now-trace=iad1]\n```\n\nIn such cases, you can visit the URL of the failed deployment and append `/_logs` to see the build error. In the case above, that would be https://test-8ashcdlew.vercel.app/_logs\n\nThe logs of this deployment will contain the actual error which may help you to understand what went wrong.\n\n##### Running integration tests locally\n\nWhile running the full integration suite locally is not recommended, it's sometimes useful to isolate a failing test by running it on your machine. To do so, you'll need to ensure you have the appropriate credentials sourced in your shell:\n\n1. Create an access token. Follow the instructions here https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token. Ensure the token scope is for your personal\n   account.\n2. Grab the team ID from the Vercel dashboard at `https://vercel.com/<MY-TEAM>/~/settings`.\n3. Source these into your shell rc file: `echo 'export VERCEL_TOKEN=<MY-TOKEN> VERCEL_TEAM_ID=<MY-TEAM-ID>' >> ~/.zshrc`\n\nFrom there, you should be able to trigger an integration test. Choose one\nthat's already isolated to check that things work:\n\n```\ncd packages/next\n```\n\nRun the test:\n\n```\npnpm test test/fixtures/00-server-build/index.test.js\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you receive a `401` status code while fetching the deployment, you need to disable [Deployment Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection) on the project.\n\n#### @vercel/nft\n\nSome of the Builders use `@vercel/nft` to tree-shake files before deployment. If you suspect an error with this tree-shaking mechanism, you can create the following script in your project:\n\n```js\nconst { nodeFileTrace } = require('@vercel/nft');\nnodeFileTrace(['path/to/entrypoint.js'], {\n  ts: true,\n  mixedModules: true,\n})\n  .then(o => console.log(o.fileList))\n  .then(e => console.error(e));\n```\n\nWhen you run this script, you'll see all the imported files. If files are missing, the bug is in [@vercel/nft](https://github.com/vercel/nft) and not the Builder.\n\n### Deploy a Builder with existing project\n\nSometimes you want to test changes to a Builder against an existing project, maybe with `vercel dev` or actual deployment. You can avoid publishing every Builder change to npm by uploading the Builder as a tarball.\n\n1. Change directory to the desired Builder `cd ./packages/node`\n2. Run `pnpm build` to compile typescript and other build steps\n3. Run `npm pack` to create a tarball file. It is imporant to not use `pnpm pack` because it will not preserve the file permissions\n4. Move the resulting tarball to a directory\n5. Run `vercel <directory>` to upload the tarball file and get a URL. Remember to append `/<tarball name>` to then end of your URL\n6. Edit any existing `vercel.json` project and replace `use` with the URL\n7. Run `vercel` or `vercel dev` to deploy with the experimental Builder\n\n**Note:** You will need to turn off vercel authentication in settings -> deployment protection so the builder can be downloaded\n\n## Reference\n\n- [Code of Conduct](./.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [Contributing Guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE)\n",

Container images are still at [ghcr.io](https://github.com/orgs/headlamp-k8s/packages). Please bear with us while we may experience some broken links.\n\n[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/7551/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/7551)\n[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp)\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fheadlamp-k8s%2Fheadlamp.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fheadlamp-k8s%2Fheadlamp?ref=badge_shield)\n\nHeadlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes web UI.\n\nHeadlamp was created to blend the traditional feature set of other web UIs/dashboards\n(i.e., to list and view resources) with added functionality.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/screenshots/videos/headlamp_quick_run.gif\" width=\"80%\">\n</div>\n\n## Features\n\n- Vendor-independent / generic Kubernetes UI\n- Works in-cluster, or locally as a desktop app\n- Multi-cluster\n- Extensible through [plugins](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/plugins)\n- UI controls reflecting user roles (no deletion/update if not allowed)\n- Clean & modern UI\n- Cancellable creation/update/deletion operations\n- Logs, exec, and resource editor with documentation\n- Read-write / interactive (actions based on permissions)\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/screenshots/screenshots/home.png\"></td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/screenshots/screenshots/cluster_chooser.png\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/screenshots/screenshots/workloads.png\"></td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/screenshots/screenshots/resource_edition.png\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td width=\"33%\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/screenshots/screenshots/logs.png\"></td>\n        <td width=\"33%\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp/screenshots/screenshots/terminal.png\"></td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n## Quickstart\n\nIf you want to deploy Headlamp in your cluster, check out the instructions on running it [in-cluster](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/in-cluster/).\n\nIf you have a kubeconfig already, you can quickly try Headlamp locally as a\n[desktop application](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/)\nfor [Linux](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/linux-installation),\n[Mac](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/mac-installation),\nor [Windows](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation/desktop/win-installation).\n**Make sure** you have a kubeconfig file set up with your favorite clusters and\nin the default path so Headlamp can use it.\n\n### Accessing\n\nHeadlamp uses [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac) for checking\nusers' access to resources. If you try Headlamp with a token that has very limited\npermissions, you may not be able to view your cluster resources correctly.\n\nSee the documentation on [how to easily get a Service Account token](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/installation#create-a-service-account-token) for your cluster.\n\n## Tested platforms\n\nWe maintain a list of the [Kubernetes platforms](./docs/platforms.md) we have\ntested Headlamp with. We invite you to add any missing platforms you have\ntested, or comment if there are any regressions in the existing ones.\n\n## Extensions / Plugins\n\nPlease see [headlamp plugins on Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=21&sort=relevance&page=1) for a list of plugins published.\n\nSee the [plugins repo](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/plugins) for some official plugins.\n\n### Plugin development\n\nIf you are interested in tweaking Headlamp to fit your use-cases, you can check out\nour [plugin development guide](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/development/plugins/).\n\n\n## Get involved\n\nCheck out our: \n- [Guidelines](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/contributing/)\n- [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md),\n- [#headlamp](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/headlamp) slack channel in the Kubernetes Slack \n- [Monthly Community Meeting](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/headlamp)\n\n## Roadmap / Release Planning\n\nIf you are interested in the direction of the project, we maintain a\n[Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/headlamp-k8s/projects/1/views/1). It has the\nbiggest changes planned so far, as well as a [board](https://github.com/orgs/headlamp-k8s/projects/1/) tracking each release.\n\n## License\n\nHeadlamp is released under the terms of the [Apache 2.0](./LICENSE) license.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nFor more information about Headlamp, see the [Headlamp FAQ](https://headlamp.dev/docs/latest/faq/).\n",

      "readme": "# vFlow - 强大的 Android 可视化工作流自动化工具\n\n**vFlow** 是一款为 Android 平台设计的、强大且高度可扩展的自动化工具。它允许你通过图形化界面，将一系列“动作模块”自由组合成强大的“工作流”，从而自动完成各种日常的、重复性的屏幕操作任务。\n\n## ✨ 项目简介\n\n**vFlow 的核心设计理念** 是将复杂的自动化逻辑分解为一个个独立、可复用、易于理解的模块。无论是简单的“每日签到”，还是包含复杂条件判断和循环的“自动化测试流程”，vFlow 都旨在提供一个直观、灵活且强大的平台。\n\n项目完全采用 Kotlin 编写，并遵循现代 Android 开发实践。其核心架构（模块注册表、动态 UI 生成器、类型安全的执行上下文）被精心设计，不仅保证了当前功能的稳定性，也为未来添加更多、更强大的自动化模块提供了无限可能。无论你是希望解放双手的普通用户，还是寻求灵感和实践的开发者，vFlow 都欢迎你的探索和贡献。\n\n## 🚀 主要特性\n\n- **可视化流程编辑器**: 通过拖拽和点击，像搭积木一样构建你的自动化流程。\n- **高度模块化**: 每个功能（如点击、查找文本、判断）都是一个独立的模块，易于维护和扩展。\n- **动态数据流**: 模块的输出可以作为后续模块的输入（“魔法变量”），实现复杂的逻辑联动。\n- **强大的逻辑控制**: 支持“如果/否则”条件判断和“循环”等控制流，让你的工作流更智能。\n- **动态参数编辑**: 编辑器 UI 会根据你选择的参数（例如，“如果”模块中变量的类型）动态变化，只显示相关的选项。\n- **完善的权限管理**: 在执行前清晰地请求工作流所需的权限，并提供统一的管理入口。\n- **现代 UI 设计**: 基于 Material 3 和动态取色，提供美观且个性化的用户界面。\n- **导入与导出**: 轻松备份、恢复和分享你的工作流。\n\n## 📸 应用截图\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><img src=\"docs/screenshot1.jpg\" width=\"200\"></td>\n    <td><img src=\"docs/screenshot2.jpg\" width=\"200\"></td>\n    <td><img src=\"docs/screenshot3.jpg\" width=\"200\"></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\">工作流列表</td>\n    <td align=\"center\">流程编辑器</td>\n    <td align=\"center\">模块选择器</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n## 🛠️ 技术架构概览\n\nvFlow 的核心是其高度解耦的模块化架构。\n\n1.  **模块 (Module)**\n\n    - 所有自动化动作的实现基础，每个模块都实现了 `ActionModule` 接口。\n    - 模块负责定义自身的元数据（名称、图标）、输入输出参数、UI 摘要、执行逻辑以及所需权限。\n    - **示例**: `ClickModule`, `IfModule`, `LoopModule`。\n\n2.  **模块注册表 (ModuleRegistry)**\n\n    - 一个单例对象，在应用启动时注册所有可用的模块。\n    - 为应用的其他部分（如动作选择器）提供按分类获取模块的能力。\n\n3.  **工作流编辑器 (Workflow Editor)**\n\n    - `WorkflowEditorActivity` 是核心 UI，负责展示和操作 `ActionStep` 列表。\n    - `ActionStepAdapter` 将 `ActionStep` 数据渲染为用户可见的卡片列表。\n    - `ActionEditorSheet` 是一个通用的底部表单，它能根据任何模块的 `InputDefinition` 动态生成编辑界面，实现了 UI 与模块逻辑的完全解耦。\n\n4.  **工作流执行器 (WorkflowExecutor)**\n    - 负责按顺序执行工作流中的每一个步骤。\n    - 为每个步骤创建包含上下文信息（如魔法变量值、服务实例）的 `ExecutionContext`。\n    - 处理模块返回的不同结果，如成功、失败，或跳转、循环等流程控制信号。\n\n## 📦 如何构建\n\n1.  克隆仓库:\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/ChaoMixian/vflow.git\n    ```\n2.  使用 Android Studio 打开项目。\n3.  等待 Gradle 同步完成。\n4.  直接运行项目到你的设备或模拟器上。\n\n## 🤝 如何贡献\n\n我们非常欢迎各种形式的贡献！无论是提交 Issue、修复 Bug、添加新功能模块还是改进文档，都对项目意义重大。\n\n1.  **Fork** 本仓库。\n2.  创建你的功能分支 (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)。\n3.  提交你的改动 (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)。\n4.  推送到你的分支 (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)。\n5.  创建一个 **Pull Request**。\n\n### 开发一个新模块\n\nvFlow 最常见的贡献方式就是添加新的模块。步骤如下：\n\n1.  在 `com.chaomixian.vflow.core.workflow.module` 包下的相应分类中创建一个新的 Kotlin 类。\n2.  让它继承自 `BaseModule` 或 `BaseBlockModule`。\n3.  实现 `ActionModule` 接口中的必要属性和方法（如 `id`, `metadata`, `getInputs`, `getOutputs`, `execute`）。\n4.  在 `ModuleRegistry.kt` 的 `initialize()` 方法中注册你的新模块。\n5.  就是这样！你的模块现在应该会自动出现在动作选择器中并可以正常使用了。\n\n[开发指南](docs/CONTRIBUTION.md)\n\n## 📄 许可证\n\n本项目采用 [GPL License](LICENSE) 许可证。\n",

components that features our independent implementation of Google's [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/design/introduction/) system.\nIt's trusted by some of the world's greatest product teams because it's been rigorously battle-tested through more than a decade of development by thousands of open-source contributors.\n\nMaterial UI's core functionality is extended by [MUI X](https://github.com/mui/mui-x), a suite of complex components for advanced use cases.\n\n## Documentation\n\nGet started in the [Material UI documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Older versions</summary>\n\n- **[v5.x](https://v5.mui.com/)** ([Upgrading from v5 to

The key design goal is to provide **the best developer experience**.\n\nIts core features are:\n\n- **Configurable load generation.** Even lower-end machines can simulate lots of traffic.\n- **Tests as code.** Reuse scripts, modularize logic, version control, and integrate tests with your CI.\n- **A full-featured API.** The scripting API is packed with features that help you simulate real application traffic.\n- **An embedded JavaScript engine.** The performance of Go, the scripting familiarity of JavaScript.\n- **Multiple Protocol support**. HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC, Browser, and more.\n- **Large extension ecosystem.** You can extend k6 to support your needs. And many people have already shared their extensions with the community! [Explore](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/extensions/explore) the available extensions.\n- **Flexible metrics storage and visualization**. Summary statistics or granular metrics, exported to the service of your choice.\n- **Native integration with Grafana cloud**. [SaaS solution](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/k6/) for test execution, metrics correlation, data analysis, and more.\n\nThis is what load testing looks like in the 21st century.\n\n## Example script\n\n\n```js\nimport http from \"k6/http\";\nimport { check, sleep } from \"k6\";\n\n// Test configuration\nexport const options = {\n  thresholds: {\n    // Assert that 99% of requests finish within 3000ms.\n    http_req_duration: [\"p(99) < 3000\"],\n  },\n  // Ramp the number of virtual users up and down\n  stages: [\n    { duration: \"30s\", target: 15 },\n    { duration: \"1m\", target: 15 },\n    { duration: \"20s\", target: 0 },\n  ],\n};\n\n// Simulated user behavior\nexport default function () {\n  let res = http.get(\"https://quickpizza.grafana.com\");\n  // Validate response status\n  check(res, { \"status was 200\": (r) => r.status == 200 });\n  sleep(1);\n}\n```\n\nYou can run scripts like this on the CLI, or in your CI, or across a Kubernetes cluster.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Don't want to write code ?\n> \n> We got you! Meet [k6 Studio](https://github.com/grafana/k6-studio), a desktop application made to help you generate k6 scripts without having to touch code!\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe docs cover all aspects of using k6. Some highlights include:\n\n- [Get Started](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/). Install, run a test, inspect results.\n- [HTTP requests](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/http-requests/). Have your virtual users use HTTP methods.\n  Or, check the other [Protocols](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/protocols/).\n- [Thresholds](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/thresholds/). Set goals for your test, and codify your SLOs.\n- [Options](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/k6-options/). Configure your load, duration, TLS certificates, and much, much more.\n- [Scenarios](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/).\n  Choose how to model your workload: open models, closed models, constant RPS, fixed iterations, and more.\n- [Results output](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/results-output/). Study, filter, and export your test results.\n- [JavaScript API](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/). Reference and examples of all k6 modules.\n- [Extensions](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/extensions/). Extend k6 for new protocols and use cases.\n\nThese links barely scratch the surface! If you're looking for conceptual information, you can read about [Test types](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/testing-guides/test-types/), [Test strategies](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/testing-guides/), or one of the many informative [Blog posts](https://k6.io/blog).\n\n## Roadmap\n\nOur team is dedicated to continuously improving and providing the best user experience possible. The [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/grafana/projects/443/views/1) covers user-oriented features, UX improvements and JavaScript support that our team will focus on.

Developer documentation in Markdown format is available under the [dev-docs](./dev-docs/) directory.\n\n * Post **bug reports or feature requests** to the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/uber/h3/issues)\n * Ask **questions** by posting to the [H3 tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/h3)\n * There is also an [H3 Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/h3-core/shared_invite/zt-g6u5r1hf-W_~uVJmfeiWtMQuBGc1NNg)\n\n## Installing\n\nWe recommend using prebuilt bindings if they are available for your programming language. Bindings for [Java](https://github.com/uber/h3-java), [JavaScript](https://github.com/uber/h3-js), [Python](https://github.com/uber/h3-py), and [others](https://h3geo.org/docs/community/bindings) are available.\n\nOn macOS, you can install H3 using `brew`:\n```\nbrew install h3\n```\nOtherwise, to build H3 from source, please see the following instructions.\n\n### Building from source\n\nStill here? To build the H3 C library, you'll need a C compiler (tested with `gcc` and `clang`), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). If you intend to contribute to H3, you must have [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) installed and we recommend installing [ccmake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/ccmake.1.html) and [LCOV](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php) to configure the `cmake` arguments to build and run the tests and generate the code coverage report. We also recommend using `gcc` for the code coverage as some versions of `clang` generate annotations that aren't compatible with `lcov`. [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) is needed to build the API documentation.\n\n#### Install build-time dependencies\n\n* Alpine\n```\n# Installing the bare build requirements\napk add cmake make gcc libtool musl-dev\n```\n\n* Debian/Ubuntu\n\n```\n# Installing the bare build requirements\nsudo apt install cmake make gcc libtool\n# Installing useful tools for development\nsudo apt install clang-format cmake-curses-gui lcov doxygen\n```\n\n* macOS (using `brew`)\n\nFirst make sure you [have the developer tools installed](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/) and then\n\n```\n# Installing the bare build requirements\nbrew install cmake\n# Installing useful tools for development\nbrew install clang-format lcov doxygen\n```\n\n* Windows (Visual Studio)\n\nYou will need to install CMake and Visual Studio, including the Visual C++ compiler. For building on Windows, please follow the [Windows build instructions](dev-docs/build_windows.md).\n\n* FreeBSD\n\n ```\n# Installing the build requirements\nsudo pkg install bash cmake gmake doxygen lcov\n```\n\n#### Compilation\n\nWhen checking out the H3 Git repository, by default you will check out the latest\ndevelopment version of H3. When using H3 in an application, you will want to check\nout the most recently released version:\n\n```\ngit checkout v$(<VERSION)\n```\n\nFrom the repository root, you can compile H3 with:\n\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\nmake\n```\n\nAll subsequent `make` commands should be run from within the `build` directory.\n\n**Note**: There are several ways to build H3 with CMake; the method above is just one example that restricts all build artifacts to the `build` directory.\n\nYou can install system-wide with:\n\n```\nsudo make install\n```\n\nIf using the method above, from the repository root, you can clean all build artifacts with:\n\n```\nrm -rf build\n```\n\n#### Testing\n\nAfter making the project, you can test with `make test`.\nYou can run a faster test suite that excludes the most expensive tests with `make test-fast`.\n\n#### Coverage\n\nYou can generate a code coverage report if `lcov` is installed, and if the project was built with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` and `ENABLE_COVERAGE=ON` options.\nFor example, from a clean repository, you could run:\n\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_COVERAGE=ON ..\nmake\nmake coverage\n```\n\nYou can then view a detailed HTML coverage report by opening `coverage/index.html` in your browser.\n\n#### Benchmarks\n\nYou can run timing benchmarks by building with the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, and running `make benchmarks`:\n\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\nmake\nmake benchmarks\n```\n\n#### Documentation\n\nYou can build developer documentation with `make docs` if Doxygen was installed when CMake was run. Index of the documentation will be `dev-docs/_build/html/index.html`.\n\nAfter making the project, you can build KML files to visualize the hexagon grid with `make kml`. The files will be placed in `KML`.\n\nTo build the documentation website, see the [website/](./website/) directory.\n\n## Usage\n\n### From the command line\n\nTo get the H3 index for some location:\n\n```\n./bin/latLngToCell --resolution 10 --latitude 40.689167 --longitude -74.044444\n```\n\n10 is the H3 resolution, between 0 (coarsest) and 15 (finest). The coordinates entered are the latitude and longitude, in degrees, you want the index for (these coordinates are the Statue of Liberty).  You should get an H3 index as output, like `8a2a1072b59ffff`.\n\nYou can then take this index and get some information about it, for example:\n\n```\n./bin/cellToBoundary --index 8a2a1072b59ffff\n```\n\nThis will produce the vertices of the hexagon at this location:\n\n```\n8a2a1072b59ffff\n{\n   40.690058601 -74.044151762\n   40.689907695 -74.045061792\n   40.689270936 -74.045341418\n   40.688785091 -74.044711031\n   40.688935993 -74.043801021\n   40.689572744 -74.043521377\n}\n```\n\nYou can get the center coordinate of the hexagon like so:\n\n```\n./bin/cellToLatLng --index 8a2a1072b59ffff\n```\n\nThis will produce some coordinate:\n\n```\n40.6894218437 -74.0444313999\n```\n\n### From C\n\nThe above features of H3 can also be used from C. For example, you can compile and run [examples/index.c](./examples/index.c) like so:\n\n```\ncc -lh3 examples/index.c -o example\n./example\n```\n\nYou should get output like:\n\n```\nThe index is: 8a2a1072b59ffff\nBoundary vertex #0: 40.690059, -74.044152\nBoundary vertex #1: 40.689908, -74.045062\nBoundary vertex #2: 40.689271, -74.045341\nBoundary vertex #3: 40.688785, -74.044711\nBoundary vertex #4: 40.688936, -74.043801\nBoundary vertex #5: 40.689573, -74.043521\nCenter coordinates: 40.689422, -74.044431\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests and Github issues are welcome.

Tensor-parallelism solves the capacity problem by spreading each layer across many GPUs—and sometimes many servers—but it creates a new one: how do you coordinate those shards, route requests, and share KV cache fast enough to feel like one accelerator? This orchestration gap is exactly what NVIDIA Dynamo is built to close.\n\nDynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang or others) and captures LLM-specific capabilities such as:\n\n- **Disaggregated prefill & decode inference** – Maximizes GPU throughput and facilitates trade off between throughput and latency.\n- **Dynamic GPU scheduling** – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand\n- **LLM-aware request routing** – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation\n- **Accelerated data transfer** – Reduces inference response time using NIXL.\n- **KV cache offloading** – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher system throughput\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./docs/images/frontpage-architecture.png\" alt=\"Dynamo architecture\" width=\"600\" />\n</p>\n\nBuilt in Rust for performance and in Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source and driven by a transparent, OSS (Open Source Software) first development approach.\n\n# Installation\n\nThe following examples require a few system level packages.\nRecommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/reference/support-matrix.md](docs/reference/support-matrix.md)\n\n## 1. Initial setup\n\nThe Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:\n\n```\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n### Install Python development headers\n\nBackend engines require Python development headers for JIT compilation. Install them with:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install python3-dev\n```\n\n### Install etcd (optional) and NATS (required)\n\nTo coordinate across a data center, Dynamo relies on etcd and NATS. These will be used in production. To run Dynamo locally etcd is optional.\n\n- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.\n- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs jetstream enabled: `nats-server -js`.\n\nTo quickly setup etcd & NATS, you can also run:\n\n```bash\n# At the root of the repository:\ndocker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d\n```\n\nTo run locally without etcd, pass `--store-kv file` to both the frontend and workers. The directory used for key-value data can be configured via the `DYN_FILE_KV` environment variable (example: `export DYN_FILE_KV=/data/kv/dynamo`). Defaults to `$TMPDIR/dynamo_store_kv`.\n\n\n## 2. Select an engine\n\nWe publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, and trtllm. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.\n\n```\nuv venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\nuv pip install pip\n\n# Choose one\nuv pip install \"ai-dynamo[sglang]\"  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.\n```\n\n## 3. Run Dynamo\n\n### Sanity check (optional)\n\nBefore trying out Dynamo, you can verify your system configuration and dependencies:\n\n```bash\n./deploy/sanity_check.py\n```\n\nThis is a quick check for system resources, development tools, LLM frameworks, and Dynamo components.\n\n### Running an LLM API server\n\nDynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:\n\n- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** – High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.\n- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** – Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.\n- **Workers** – Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.\n\n```\n# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server, a pre-processor (prompt templating and tokenization) and a router.\n# Pass the TLS certificate and key paths to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.\n# Pass --store-kv to use the filesystem instead of etcd. The workers and frontend must share a disk.\npython -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 [--tls-cert-path cert.pem] [--tls-key-path key.pem] [--store-kv file]\n\n# Start the SGLang engine, connecting to NATS and etcd to receive requests. You can run several of these,\n# both for the same model and for multiple models. The frontend node will discover them.\n# Pass --store-kv to use the filesystem instead of etcd. The workers and frontend must share a disk.\npython -m dynamo.sglang --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B [--store-kv file]\n```\n\n#### Send a Request\n\n```bash\ncurl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"   -d '{\n    \"model\": \"deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B\",\n    \"messages\": [\n    {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Hello, how are you?\"\n    }\n    ],\n    \"stream\":false,\n    \"max_tokens\": 300\n  }' | jq\n```\n\nRerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.\n\n### Deploying Dynamo\n\n- Follow the [Quickstart Guide](docs/kubernetes/README.md) to deploy on Kubernetes.\n- Check out [Backends](examples/backends) to deploy various workflow configurations (e.g. SGLang with router, vLLM with disaggregated serving, etc.)\n- Run some [Examples](examples) to learn about building components in Dynamo and exploring various integrations.\n\n### Benchmarking Dynamo\n\nDynamo provides comprehensive benchmarking tools to evaluate and optimize your deployments:\n\n- **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md)** – Compare deployment topologies (aggregated vs. disaggregated vs. vanilla vLLM) using AIPerf\n- **[SLA-Driven Dynamo Deployments](docs/planner/sla_planner_quickstart.md)** – Optimize your deployment to meet SLA requirements\n\n## Frontend OpenAPI specification\n\nThe OpenAI-compatible HTTP frontend exposes an OpenAPI 3 specification at `/openapi.json`.\nTo generate and persist the same specification without running the server (for example for CI, documentation, or NIM integration), run:\n\n```bash\ncargo run -p dynamo-llm --bin generate-frontend-openapi\n```\n\nThis writes the current frontend spec to `docs/frontends/openapi.json` at the repository root.\n\n# Engines\n\nDynamo is designed to be inference engine agnostic. To use any engine with Dynamo, NATS and etcd need to be installed, along with a Dynamo frontend (`python -m dynamo.frontend [--interactive]`).\n\n## vLLM\n\n```\nuv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]\n```\n\nRun the backend/worker like this:\n\n```\npython -m dynamo.vllm --help\n```\n\nvLLM attempts to allocate enough KV cache for the full context length at startup. If that does not fit in your available memory pass `--context-length <value>`.\n\nTo specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.\n\n## SGLang\n\n```\n# Install libnuma\napt install -y libnuma-dev\n\nuv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]\n```\n\nRun the backend/worker like this:\n\n```\npython -m dynamo.sglang --help\n```\n\nYou can pass any sglang flags directly to this worker, see https://docs.sglang.ai/advanced_features/server_arguments.html . See there to use multiple GPUs.\n\n## TensorRT-LLM\n\nIt is recommended to use [NGC PyTorch Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch) for running the TensorRT-LLM engine.\n\n> [!Note]\n> Ensure that you select a PyTorch container image version that matches the version of TensorRT-LLM you are using.\n> For example, if you are using `tensorrt-llm==1.2.0rc5`, use the PyTorch container image version `25.10`.\n> To find the correct PyTorch container version for your desired `tensorrt-llm` release, visit the [TensorRT-LLM Dockerfile.multi](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.multi) on GitHub. Switch to the branch that matches your `tensorrt-llm` version, and look for the `BASE_TAG` line to identify the recommended PyTorch container tag.\n\n> [!Important]\n> Launch container with the following additional settings `--shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1`\n\n### Install prerequisites\n\n```\n# Optional step: Only required for non-container installations. The PyTorch 25.10 container already includes PyTorch 2.9.0 with CUDA 13.0.\nuv pip install torch==2.9.0 torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130\n\nsudo apt-get -y install libopenmpi-dev\n\n# Optional step: Only required for disaggregated serving\nsudo apt-get -y install libzmq3-dev\n```\n\n> [!Tip]\n> You can learn more about these prequisites and known issues with TensorRT-LLM pip based installation [here](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/installation/linux.html).\n\n### After installing the pre-requisites above, install Dynamo\n\n```\nuv pip install ai-dynamo[trtllm]\n```\n\nRun the backend/worker like this:\n\n```\npython -m dynamo.trtllm --help\n```\n\nTo specify which GPUs to use set environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.\n\n# Developing Locally\n\n## 1. Install libraries\n\n**Ubuntu:**\n\n```\nsudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake\n```\n\n**macOS:**\n\n- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)\n\n```\n# if brew is not installed on your system, install it\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n```\n\n- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)\n\n```\nbrew install cmake protobuf\n\n## Check that Metal is accessible\nxcrun -sdk macosx metal\n```\n\nIf Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.\n\n## 2. Install Rust\n\n```\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\nsource $HOME/.cargo/env\n```\n\n## 3. Create a Python virtual env:\n\nFollow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don't have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.\n\n- Install uv\n\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n- Create a virtual environment\n\n```bash\nuv venv dynamo\nsource dynamo/bin/activate\n```\n\n## 4. Install build tools\n\n```\nuv pip install pip maturin\n```\n\n[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust<->Python bindings build tool.\n\n## 5. Build the Rust bindings\n\n```\ncd lib/bindings/python\nmaturin develop --uv\n```\n\n## 6. Install the wheel\n\n```\ncd $PROJECT_ROOT\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\nYou should now be able to run `python -m dynamo.frontend`.\n\nRemember that nats and etcd must typically be running (see earlier).\n\nSet the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.\n\nIf you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.\n",

are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:\n\n    1. **Object literal syntax:**\n\n       The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = {\n         name: \"Sudheer\",\n         age: 34,\n       };\n       ```\n\n       Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.\n\n       **Note:** This is one of the easiest ways to create an object and it's most commonly used for creating simple, ad-hoc objects.\n\n    2. **Object constructor:**\n\n       The simplest way to create an empty object is using the `Object` constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = new Object();\n       ```\n\n       The `Object()` is a built-in constructor function so \"new\" keyword is not required for creating plain objects. The above code snippet can be re-written as:\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = Object();\n       ```\n       However, `Object()` can be used to either create a plain object or convert a given value into its corresponding object wrapper, whereas `new Object()` is specifically used to explicitly create a new object instance.\n       \n    3. **Object's create method:**\n\n       The `create` method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specified prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects. In other words, this is useful for setting up **prototypal inheritance**. The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.\n\n       The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.\n\n       ```javascript\n       var object = Object.create(null);\n       ```\n\n       The following example creates an object along with additional new properties.\n\n       ```javascript\n       let vehicle = {\n         wheels: \"4\",\n         fuelType: \"Gasoline\",\n         color: \"Green\",\n       };\n       let carProps = {\n         type: {\n           value: \"Volkswagen\",\n         },\n         model: {\n           value: \"Golf\",\n         },\n       };\n\n       var car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);\n       console.log(car);\n       ```\n\n    4. **Function constructor:**\n\n       In this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances. This was the main way to do constructor-based OOP before ES6 classes.\n\n       ```javascript\n       function Person(name) {\n         this.name = name;\n         this.age = 21;\n       }\n       var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n       ```\n    5. **Function constructor with prototype:**\n\n       This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods. Using prototype means you're sharing methods/properties across instances, which saves memory and improve performance.\n\n       ```javascript\n       function Person() {}\n       Person.prototype.name = \"Sudheer\";\n       var object = new Person();\n       ```\n\n       This is equivalent to creating an instance with `Object.create` method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.\n\n       ```javascript\n       function func(x, y, z) {\n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n        this.z = z;\n       }\n\n       var instance = new func(1, 2, 3);\n       ```\n\n       **(OR)**\n\n       ```javascript\n       function func(x, y, z) {\n          this.x = x;\n          this.y = y;\n          this.z = z;\n       }\n       // Create a new instance using function prototype.\n       var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype);\n\n       // Call the function\n       var result = func.call(newInstance, 1, 2, 3);\n\n       // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.\n       console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);\n       ```\n\n    6. **Object's assign method:**\n\n       The `Object.assign` method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object. This is mainly used for cloning and merging\n\n       The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.\n\n       ```javascript\n       const orgObject = { company: \"XYZ Corp\" };\n       const carObject = { name: \"Toyota\" };\n       const staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);\n       ```\n\n    7. **ES6 Class syntax:**\n\n       ES6 introduces class feature to create objects. This is syntactic sugar over the prototype-based system.\n\n       ```javascript\n       class Person {\n         constructor(name) {\n           this.name = name;\n         }\n       }\n\n       var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n       ```\n\n    8. **Singleton pattern:**\n\n       A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.\n\n        ##### Singleton with Closure (Classic JS Pattern)\n        ```javascript\n        const Singleton = (function () {\n        let instance;\n\n        function createInstance() {\n          return { name: \"Sudheer\" };\n        }\n\n        return {\n          getInstance: function () {\n            if (!instance) {\n              instance = createInstance();\n            }\n            return instance;\n          }\n        };\n        })();\n\n        // Usage\n        const obj1 = Singleton.getInstance();\n        const obj2 = Singleton.getInstance();\n\n        console.log(obj1 === obj2); // true\n        ```\n         In modern JavaScript applications, singletons are commonly implemented using ES6 modules for their built-in caching behavior, or closures for encapsulated state management.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n2. ### What is a prototype chain\n\n    The prototype chain is a core concept in JavaScript’s inheritance model. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on that object itself. If it’s not found, the engine looks up the object's internal `[[Prototype]]` reference (accessible via `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or the deprecated `__proto__` property) and continues searching up the chain until it finds the property or reaches the end (usually `null`).\n\n    For objects created via constructor functions, the prototype chain starts with the instance, then refers to the constructor’s `.prototype` object, and continues from there. For example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    function Person() {}\n    const person1 = new Person();\n\n    console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person1) === Person.prototype); // true\n    ```\n\n    This mechanism allows for property and method sharing among objects, enabling code reuse and a form of inheritance.\n\n    **Summary:**\n\n    *   The prototype chain enables inheritance in JavaScript.\n    *   If a property isn’t found on an object, JavaScript looks up its prototype chain.\n    *   The prototype of an object instance can be accessed with `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or `__proto__`.\n    *   The prototype of a constructor function is available via `Constructor.prototype`.\n    *   The chain ends when the prototype is `null`.\n\n    The prototype chain among objects appears as below, \n    \n    ![Screenshot](images/prototype_chain.png)\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n3. ### What is the Difference Between `call`, `apply`, and `bind`\n\n  In JavaScript, `call`, `apply`, and `bind` are methods that allow you to control the context (`this` value) in which a function is executed. While their purposes are similar, they differ in how they handle arguments and when the function is invoked.\n\n  ---\n\n  #### `call`\n\n  - **Description:**  \n    The `call()` method invokes a function immediately, allowing you to specify the value of `this` and pass arguments individually (comma-separated).\n\n  - **Syntax:**  \n    ```js\n    func.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)\n    ```\n\n  - **Example:**\n    ```js\n    var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n    var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n      console.log(\n        greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n      );\n    }\n\n    invite.call(employee1, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n    invite.call(employee2, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n    ```\n\n  ---\n\n  #### `apply`\n\n  - **Description:**  \n    The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it takes the function arguments as an array (or array-like object) instead of individual arguments.\n\n  - **Syntax:**  \n    ```js\n    func.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])\n    ```\n\n  - **Example:**\n    ```js\n    var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n    var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n      console.log(\n        greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n      );\n    }\n\n    invite.apply(employee1, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n    invite.apply(employee2, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n    ```\n\n  ---\n\n  #### `bind`\n\n  - **Description:**  \n    The `bind()` method creates a new function with a specific `this` value and, optionally, preset initial arguments. Unlike `call` and `apply`, `bind` does **not** immediately invoke the function; instead, it returns a new function that you can call later.\n\n  - **Syntax:**  \n    ```js\n    var boundFunc = func.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])\n    ```\n\n  - **Example:**\n    ```js\n    var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n    var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n    function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n      console.log(\n        greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n      );\n    }\n\n    var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);\n    var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);\n\n    inviteEmployee1(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n    inviteEmployee2(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n    ```\n\n  ---\n\n  #### Summary\n\n  | Method | Invokes Function Immediately? | How Arguments Are Passed         | Returns      |\n  |--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|\n  | `call` | Yes                           | Comma-separated list             | Function's result |\n  | `apply`| Yes                           | Array or array-like object       | Function's result |\n  | `bind` | No                            | (Optional) preset, then rest     | New function      |\n\n  ---\n\n  ## Key Points\n\n  - **`call`** and **`apply`** are almost interchangeable; both invoke the function immediately, but differ in how arguments are passed.\n      - _Tip:_ \"Call is for Comma-separated, Apply is for Array.\"\n  - **`bind`** does not execute the function immediately. Instead, it creates a new function with the specified `this` value and optional arguments, which can be called later.\n\n  - Use `call` or `apply` when you want to immediately invoke a function with a specific `this` context. Use `bind` when you want to create a new function with a specific `this` context to be invoked later.\n  \n  ---\n\n  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n4. ### What is JSON and its common operations\n\n    **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a lightweight, text-based data format that uses JavaScript object syntax for structuring data. It was popularized by Douglas Crockford and is widely used for transmitting data between a server and a client in web applications. JSON files typically have a `.json` extension and use the MIME type `application/json`. \n\n    #### Common Operations with JSON\n\n    1. **Parsing**: Transforming a JSON-formatted string into a native JavaScript object.\n      ```js\n      const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n      ```\n      - Example:  \n        ```js\n        const jsonString = '{\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":30}';\n        const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);  // { name: \"John\", age: 30 }\n        ```\n\n    2. **Stringification**: Converting a JavaScript object into a JSON-formatted string, commonly used for data transmission or storage.\n      ```js\n      const jsonString = JSON.stringify(object);\n      ```\n      - Example:  \n        ```js\n        const obj = { name: \"Jane\", age: 25 };\n        const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);  // '{\"name\":\"Jane\",\"age\":25}'\n        ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n5. ### What is the purpose of the array slice method\n\n    The `slice()` method in JavaScript is used to extract a section of an array, returning a new array containing the selected elements. It does not modify the original array. The method takes two arguments:\n\n    - **start**: The index at which extraction begins (inclusive).\n    - **end** (optional): The index before which to end extraction (exclusive). If omitted, extraction continues to the end of the array.\n\n    You can also use negative indices, which count from the end of the array.\n\n    #### Examples:\n\n    ```js\n    let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n    let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2);    // [1, 2]\n    let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3);    // [3]\n    let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4);       // [5]\n    let arrayIntegers4 = arrayIntegers.slice(-3, -1);  // [3, 4]\n    ```\n\n    **Note:**  \n    The `slice()` method does **not** mutate (change) the original array; instead, it returns a new array containing the extracted elements.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n6. ### What is the purpose of the array splice method\n\n    The `splice()` method in JavaScript is used to add, remove, or replace elements within an array. Unlike `slice()`, which creates a shallow copy and does not alter the original array, `splice()` **modifies the original array in place** and returns an array containing the removed elements.\n\n    #### Syntax\n\n    ```javascript\n    array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)\n    ```\n    - **start:** The index at which to start changing the array.\n    - **deleteCount:** (Optional) The number of elements to remove from the array. If omitted, all elements from the start index to the end of the array will be removed.\n    - **item1, item2, ...:** (Optional) Elements to add to the array, starting at the start position.\n\n    #### Examples\n\n    ```javascript\n    let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n    // Remove the first two elements\n    let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); \n    // arrayIntegers1: [1, 2]\n    // arrayIntegersOriginal1 (after): [3, 4, 5]\n\n    // Remove all elements from index 3 onwards\n    let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3);     \n    // arrayIntegers2: [4, 5]\n    // arrayIntegersOriginal2 (after): [1, 2, 3]\n\n    // Remove 1 element at index 3, then insert \"a\", \"b\", \"c\" at that position\n    let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); \n    // arrayIntegers3: [4]\n    // arrayIntegersOriginal3 (after): [1, 2, 3, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", 5]\n    ```\n\n    **Note:**  \n    - The `splice()` method **modifies the original array**.\n    - It returns an array containing the elements that were removed (if any).\n    - You can use it both to remove and insert elements in a single operation.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n7. ### What is the difference between slice and splice\n   \n    Here are the key differences between `slice()` and `splice()` methods in JavaScript arrays:\n\n    | `slice()`                                         | `splice()`                                          |\n    | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n    | Does **not** modify the original array (immutable) | Modifies the original array (mutable)               |\n    | Returns a **shallow copy** (subset) of selected elements | Returns an array of the **removed** elements           |\n    | Used to **extract** elements from an array         | Used to **add**, **remove**, or **replace** elements in an array |\n    | Syntax: `array.slice(start, end)`                  | Syntax: `array.splice(start, deleteCount, ...items)`             |\n\n    **Summary:**  \n    - Use `slice()` when you want to copy or extract elements without altering the original array.\n    - Use `splice()` when you need to add, remove, or replace elements and want to change the original array.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n8. ### How do you compare Object and Map\n\n    **Objects** and **Maps** both allow you to associate keys with values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and check if a key exists. Historically, Objects have been used as Maps, but there are several key differences that make `Map` a better choice in certain scenarios:\n\n    | Feature                  | Object                                              | Map                                                      |\n    |--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n    | **Key Types**            | Only strings and symbols are valid keys             | Any value can be used as a key (objects, functions, primitives) |\n    | **Key Order**            | Keys are unordered (in practice, insertion order is mostly preserved for string keys, but not guaranteed) | Keys are ordered by insertion; iteration follows insertion order |\n    | **Size Property**        | No built-in way to get the number of keys; must use `Object.keys(obj).length` | Use the `.size` property for the number of entries        |\n    | **Iterability**          | Not directly iterable; must use `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, or `Object.entries` | Directly iterable with `for...of`, `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.entries()` |\n    | **Prototype**            | Has a prototype chain; may have default properties that can collide with custom keys (can be avoided with `Object.create(null)`) | Does not have a prototype, so there are no default keys   |\n    | **Performance**          | May be less efficient for frequent additions/removals | Optimized for frequent additions and deletions            |\n    | **Serialization**        | Can be easily serialized to JSON                    | Cannot be directly serialized to JSON                     |\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n9. ### What is the difference between == and === operators\n    JavaScript provides two types of equality operators:\n\n    - **Loose equality (`==`, `!=`)**: Performs type conversion if the types differ, comparing values after converting them to a common type.\n    - **Strict equality (`===`, `!==`)**: Compares both value and type, without any type conversion.\n\n    #### Strict Equality (`===`)\n    - Two strings are strictly equal if they have exactly the same sequence of characters and length.\n    - Two numbers are strictly equal if they have the same numeric value.\n      - **Special cases:**\n        - `NaN === NaN` is `false`\n        - `+0 === -0` is `true`\n    - Two booleans are strictly equal if both are `true` or both are `false`.\n    - Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the **same object** in memory.\n    - `null` and `undefined` are **not** strictly equal.\n\n    #### Loose Equality (`==`)\n    - Converts operands to the same type before making the comparison.\n    - `null == undefined` is `true`.\n    - `\"1\" == 1` is `true` because the string is converted to a number.\n    - `0 == false` is `true` because `false` is converted to `0`.\n\n    #### Examples:\n\n    ```javascript\n    0 == false            // true      (loose equality, type coercion)\n    0 === false           // false     (strict equality, different types)\n    1 == \"1\"              // true      (string converted to number)\n    1 === \"1\"             // false     (different types)\n    null == undefined     // true      (special case)\n    null === undefined    // false     (different types)\n    '0' == false          // true      ('0' is converted to 0)\n    '0' === false         // false     (different types)\n    NaN == NaN            // false     (NaN is never equal to itself)\n    NaN === NaN           // false\n    [] == []              // false     (different array objects)\n    [] === []             // false\n    {} == {}              // false     (different object references)\n    {} === {}             // false\n    ```\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n10. ### What are lambda expressions or arrow functions\n\n    **Arrow functions** (also known as \"lambda expressions\") provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. Introduced in ES6, arrow functions are often shorter and more readable, especially for simple operations or callbacks.\n\n    #### Key Features:\n    - Arrow functions do **not** have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` bindings. They inherit these from their surrounding (lexical) context.\n    - They are best suited for non-method functions, such as callbacks or simple computations.\n    - Arrow functions **cannot** be used as constructors and do not have a `prototype` property.\n    - They also cannot be used with `new`, `yield`, or as generator functions.\n\n    #### Syntax Examples:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b;    // Multiple parameters, returns a + b\n    const arrowFunc2 = a => a * 10;        // Single parameter (parentheses optional), returns a * 10\n    const arrowFunc3 = () => {};           // No parameters, returns undefined\n    const arrowFunc4 = (a, b) => {\n      // Multiple statements require curly braces and explicit return\n      const sum = a + b;\n      return sum * 2;\n    };\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n11. ### What is a first class function\n\n    In JavaScript, **first-class functions(first-class citizens)** mean that functions are treated like any other variable. That means:\n\n    1. You can assign a function to a variable.\n    2. You can pass a function as an argument to another function.\n    3. You can return a function from another function.\n\n    This capability enables powerful patterns like callbacks, higher-order functions, event handling, and functional programming in JavaScript.\n    \n    For example, the handler function below is assigned to a variable and then passed as an argument to the `addEventListener` method.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const handler = () => console.log(\"This is a click handler function\");\n    document.addEventListener(\"click\", handler);\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n12. ### What is a first order function\n\n    A first-order function is a function that doesn’t accept another function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return value. i.e,  It's a regular function that works with primitive or non-function values.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const firstOrder = () => console.log(\"I am a first order function!\");\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n13. ### What is a higher order function\n\n    A higher-order function is a function that either accepts another function as an argument, returns a function as its result, or both. This concept is a core part of JavaScript's functional programming capabilities and is widely used for creating modular, reusable, and expressive code.\n\n    The syntactic structure of higher order function will be explained with an example as follows,\n\n      ```javascript\n      // First-order function (does not accept or return another function)\n      const firstOrderFunc = () => \n        console.log(\"Hello, I am a first-order function\");\n\n      // Higher-order function (accepts a function as an argument)\n      const higherOrder = (callback) => callback();\n\n      // Passing the first-order function to the higher-order function\n      higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);\n      ```\n\n    In this example:\n\n    1. `firstOrderFunc` is a regular (first-order) function.\n\n    2. `higherOrder` is a higher-order function because it takes another function as an argument.\n\n    3. `firstOrderFunc` is also called a **callback function** because it is passed to and executed by another function.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n14. ### What is a unary function\n\n    A unary function (also known as a **monadic** function) is a function that **accepts exactly one argument**. The term \"unary\" simply refers to the function's arity—the number of arguments it takes.\n\n    Let us take an example of unary function,\n\n    ```javascript\n    const unaryFunction = (a) => console.log(a + 10); // This will add 10 to the input and log the result\n    unaryFunction(5); // Output: 15\n    ```\n    In this example:\n\n    - `unaryFunction` takes a single parameter `a`, making it a unary function.\n    - It performs a simple operation: adding 10 to the input and printing the result.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n15. ### What is the currying function\n    \n    **Currying** is the process of transforming a function with **multiple arguments** into a sequence of **nested functions**, each accepting **only one argument** at a time.\n\n    This concept is named after mathematician **Haskell Curry**, and is commonly used in functional programming to enhance modularity and reuse.\n\n\n    ## Before Currying (Normal n-ary Function)\n\n    ```javascript\n    const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n\n    console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6\n    ```\n    This is a standard function that takes three arguments at once.\n\n    ## After Currying (Unary Function Chain)\n    ```javascript\n    const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;\n\n    console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1));       // Returns: function (b) => ...\n    console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2));    // Returns: function (c) => ...\n    console.log(curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3)); // Output: 6\n\n    ```\n    Each function in the chain accepts one argument and returns the next function, until all arguments are provided and the final result is computed.\n\n    ## Benefits of Currying\n      - Improves code reusability\n      → You can partially apply functions with known arguments.\n\n      - Enhances functional composition\n      → Easier to compose small, pure functions.\n\n      - Encourages clean, modular code\n      → You can split logic into smaller single-responsibility functions.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n16. ### What is a pure function\n\n    A **pure function** is a function whose output depends only on its input arguments and produces no side effects. This means that given the same inputs, a pure function will always return the same output, and it does not modify any external state or data.\n\n    Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,\n\n    #### Example: Pure vs. Impure Functions\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Impure Function\n    let numberArray = [];\n    const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);\n\n    // Pure Function\n    const pureAddNumber = (number) => (inputArray) =>\n      inputArray.concat([number]);\n\n    // Usage\n    console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1\n    console.log(numberArray);        // returns [6]\n\n    console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]\n    console.log(numberArray);                   // remains [6]\n    ```\n    - `impureAddNumber` changes the external variable numberArray and returns the new length of the array, making it impure.\n    - `pureAddNumber` creates a new array with the added number and does not modify the original array, making it pure.\n\n17. ### What are the benefits of pure functions\n    Some of the major benefits of pure functions are listed below,\n\n    - **Easier testing:** Since output depends only on input, pure functions are simple to test.\n    - **Predictability:** No hidden side effects make behavior easier to reason about.\n    - **Immutability:** Pure functions align with ES6 best practices, such as preferring const over let, supporting safer and more maintainable code.\n    - **No side effects:** Reduces bugs related to shared state or mutation.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n18. ### What is the purpose of the let keyword\n\n    The `let` keyword in JavaScript is used to declare a **block-scoped local variable**. This means that variables declared with `let` are only accessible within the block, statement, or expression where they are defined. This is a significant improvement over the older `var` keyword, which is function-scoped (or globally-scoped if declared outside a function), and does not respect block-level scoping.\n\n    #### Key Features of `let`:\n    - **Block Scope:** The variable exists only within the nearest enclosing block (e.g., inside an `{}` pair).\n    - **No Hoisting Issues:** While `let` declarations are hoisted, they are not initialized until the code defining them is executed. Accessing them before declaration results in a ReferenceError (temporal dead zone).\n    - **No Redeclaration:** The same variable cannot be declared twice in the same scope with `let`.\n\n    #### Example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 30;\n    if (counter === 30) {\n      let counter = 31;\n      console.log(counter); // Output: 31 (block-scoped variable inside if-block)\n    }\n    console.log(counter); // Output: 30 (outer variable, unaffected by inner block)\n    ```\n\n    In this example, the `counter` inside the `if` block is a separate variable from the one outside. The `let` keyword ensures that both have their own distinct scope.\n\n    In summary, you need to use `let` when you want variables to be limited to the block in which they are defined, preventing accidental overwrites and bugs related to variable scope.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n19. ### What is the difference between let and var\n\n    You can list out the differences in a tabular format\n\n    | var                                                            | let                                           |\n    | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n    | It has been available from the beginning of JavaScript         | Introduced as part of ES6                     |\n    | It has function scope                                          | It has block scope                            |\n    | Variable declaration will be hoisted, initialized as undefined | Hoisted but not initialized                   |\n    | It is possible to re-declare the variable in the same scope    | It is not possible to re-declare the variable |\n\n    Let's take an example to see the difference,\n\n    ```javascript\n    function userDetails(username) {\n      if (username) {\n        console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting\n        console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization\n        let age = 30;\n        var salary = 10000;\n      }\n      console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible due to function scope)\n      console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)\n    }\n    userDetails(\"John\");\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n20. ### What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword\n\n    The keyword `let` was chosen because it originates from mathematical notation, where \"let\" is used to introduce new variables (for example, \"let x = 5\"). This term was adopted by several early programming languages such as Scheme and BASIC, establishing a tradition in computer science. JavaScript follows this convention by using `let` to declare variables with block scope, providing a modern alternative to `var`. The choice helps make the language more familiar to programmers coming from other languages and aligns with the mathematical practice of variable assignment.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n21. ### How do you redeclare variables in a switch block without an error\n\n    When you try to redeclare variables using `let` or `const` in multiple `case` clauses of a `switch` statement, you will get a SyntaxError. This happens because, in JavaScript, all `case` clauses within a `switch` statement share the same block scope. For example:\n    \n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 1;\n    switch (x) {\n      case 0:\n        let name;\n        break;\n      case 1:\n        let name; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared\n        break;\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    To avoid this error, you can create a new block scope within each `case` clause by wrapping the code in curly braces `{}`. This way, each `let` or `const` declaration is scoped only to that block, and redeclaration errors are avoided:\n    \n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 1;\n    switch (x) {\n      case 0: {\n        let name;\n        // code for case 0\n        break;\n      }\n      case 1: {\n        let name; // No SyntaxError\n        // code for case 1\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    That means, to safely redeclare variables in different cases of a switch statement, wrap each case’s code in its own block using curly braces. This ensures each variable declaration is scoped to its specific case block.\n    \n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n22. ### What is the Temporal Dead Zone\n\n    The **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** refers to the period between the start of a block and the point where a variable declared with `let` or `const` is initialized. During this time, the variable exists in scope but **cannot be accessed**, and attempting to do so results in a `ReferenceError`.\n    \n    This behavior is part of **JavaScript's ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** specification and applies **only to variables declared with `let` and `const`**, not `var`. Variables declared with `var` are **hoisted** and initialized with `undefined`, so accessing them before the declaration does not throw an error, though it can lead to unexpected results.\n    \n    #### Example\n    \n    ```javascript\n    function someMethod() {\n        console.log(counter1); // Output: undefined (due to var hoisting)\n        console.log(counter2); // Throws ReferenceError (TDZ for let)\n    \n        var counter1 = 1;\n        let counter2 = 2;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n23. ### What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)\n\n    IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    (function () {\n      // logic here\n    })();\n    ```\n\n    The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables from the IIFE then it throws an error as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    (function () {\n      var message = \"IIFE\";\n      console.log(message);\n    })();\n    console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n24. ### How do you decode or encode a URL in JavaScript?\n\n    `encodeURI()` function is used to encode an URL. This function requires a URL string as a parameter and return that encoded string.\n    `decodeURI()` function is used to decode an URL. This function requires an encoded URL string as parameter and return that decoded string.\n\n    **Note:** If you want to encode characters such as `/ ? : @ & = + $ #` then you need to use `encodeURIComponent()`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    let uri = \"employeeDetails?name=john&occupation=manager\";\n    let encoded_uri = encodeURI(uri);\n    let decoded_uri = decodeURI(encoded_uri);\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n25. ### What is memoization\n\n    Memoization is a functional programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.\n    Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,\n\n    ```javascript\n    const memoizeAddition = () => {\n      let cache = {};\n      return (value) => {\n        if (value in cache) {\n          console.log(\"Fetching from cache\");\n          return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.\n        } else {\n          console.log(\"Calculating result\");\n          let result = value + 20;\n          cache[value] = result;\n          return result;\n        }\n      };\n    };\n    // returned function from memoizeAddition\n    const addition = memoizeAddition();\n    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated\n    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n26. ### What is Hoisting\n\n \nHoisting is JavaScript's default behavior where **variable and function declarations** are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means you can access certain variables and functions even before they are defined in the code.\n\n\nExample of variable hoisting:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(message); // Output: undefined\nvar message = \"The variable has been hoisted\";\n```\n\n```js\nvar message;\nconsole.log(message); // undefined\nmessage = \"The variable has been hoisted\";\n```\n\nExample of function hoisting:\n\n```js\nmessage(\"Good morning\"); // Output: Good morning\n\nfunction message(name) {\n  console.log(name);\n}\n```\n\nBecause of hoisting, functions can be used before they are declared.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n27. ### What are classes in ES6\n\n    In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.\n    For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    function Bike(model, color) {\n      this.model = model;\n      this.color = color;\n    }\n\n    Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {\n      return this.model + \" bike has\" + this.color + \" color\";\n    };\n    ```\n\n    Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative\n\n    ```javascript\n    class Bike {\n      constructor(color, model) {\n        this.color = color;\n        this.model = model;\n      }\n\n      getDetails() {\n        return this.model + \" bike has\" + this.color + \" color\";\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n28. ### What are closures\n\n    A closure is the combination of a function bundled(enclosed) together with its lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables, functions and other data even after the outer function has finished its execution. The closure has three scope chains.\n\n    1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets\n    2. Outer function's variables\n    3. Global variables\n\n    Let's take an example of closure concept,\n\n    ```javascript\n    function Welcome(name) {\n      var greetingInfo = function (message) {\n        console.log(message + \" \" + name);\n      };\n      return greetingInfo;\n    }\n    var myFunction = Welcome(\"John\");\n    myFunction(\"Welcome \"); //Output: Welcome John\n    myFunction(\"Hello Mr.\"); //output: Hello Mr. John\n    ```\n\n    As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n29. ### What are modules\n\n    Modules refer to small units of independent, reusable code and also act as the foundation of many JavaScript design patterns. Most of the JavaScript modules export an object literal, a function, or a constructor\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n30. ### Why do you need modules\n\n    Below are the list of benefits using modules in javascript ecosystem\n\n    1. Maintainability\n    2. Reusability\n    3. Namespacing\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n31. ### What is scope in javascript\n\n    Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n32. ### What is a service worker\n\n    A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n33. ### How do you manipulate DOM using a service worker\n\n    Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the `postMessage` interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n34. ### How do you reuse information across service worker restarts\n\n    The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n35. ### What is IndexedDB\n\n    IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of larger amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n36. ### What is web storage\n\n    Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.\n\n    1. **Local storage:** It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.\n    2. **Session storage:** It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n37. ### What is a post message\n\n    Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n38. ### What is a Cookie\n\n    A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.\n    For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    document.cookie = \"username=John\";\n    ```\n\n    ![Screenshot](images/cookie.png)\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n39. ### Why do you need a Cookie\n\n    Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,\n\n    1. When a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.\n    2. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n40. ### What are the options in a cookie\n\n    There are few below options available for a cookie,\n\n    1. By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).\n\n    ```javascript\n    document.cookie = \"username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC\";\n    ```\n\n    2. By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.\n\n    ```javascript\n    document.cookie = \"username=John; path=/services\";\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n41. ### How do you delete a cookie\n\n    You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case.\n    For example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.\n\n    ```javascript\n    document.cookie =\n      \"username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;\";\n    ```\n\n    **Note:** You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie. Some browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless you specify a path parameter.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n42. ### What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage\n\n    Below are some of the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage,\n\n    | Feature                           | Cookie                                                                                                              | Local storage         | Session storage     |\n    | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |\n    | Accessed on client or server side | Both server-side & client-side. The `set-cookie` HTTP response header is used by server inorder to send it to user. | client-side only      | client-side only    |\n    | Expiry                            | Manually configured using Expires option                                                                            | Forever until deleted | until tab is closed |\n    | SSL support                       | Supported                                                                                                           | Not supported         | Not supported       |\n    | Maximum data size                 | 4KB                                                                                                                 | 5 MB                  | 5MB                 |\n    | Accessible from                   | Any window                                                                                                          | Any window            | Same tab            |\n    | Sent with requests                | Yes                                                                                                                 | No                    | No                  |\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n43. ### What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage\n\n    LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n44. ### How do you access web storage\n\n    The Window object implements the `WindowLocalStorage` and `WindowSessionStorage` objects which has `localStorage`(window.localStorage) and `sessionStorage`(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (session or local).\n    For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below\n\n    ```javascript\n    localStorage.setItem(\"logo\", document.getElementById(\"logo\").value);\n    localStorage.getItem(\"logo\");\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n45. ### What are the methods available on session storage\n\n    The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the session data\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Save data to sessionStorage\n    sessionStorage.setItem(\"key\", \"value\");\n\n    // Get saved data from sessionStorage\n    let data = sessionStorage.getItem(\"key\");\n\n    // Remove saved data from sessionStorage\n    sessionStorage.removeItem(\"key\");\n\n    // Remove all saved data from sessionStorage\n    sessionStorage.clear();\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n46. ### What is a storage event and its event handler\n\n    The StorageEvent is an event that fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document. Whereas onstorage property is an EventHandler for processing storage events.\n    The syntax would be as below\n\n    ```javascript\n    window.onstorage = functionRef;\n    ```\n\n    Let's take the example usage of onstorage event handler which logs the storage key and it's values\n\n    ```javascript\n    window.onstorage = function (e) {\n      console.log(\n        \"The \" +\n          e.key +\n          \" key has been changed from \" +\n          e.oldValue +\n          \" to \" +\n          e.newValue +\n          \".\"\n      );\n    };\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n47. ### Why do you need web storage\n\n    Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information is never transferred to the server. Hence this is a more recommended approach than Cookies.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n48. ### How do you check web storage browser support\n\n    You need to check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage before using web storage,\n\n    ```javascript\n    if (typeof Storage !== \"undefined\") {\n      // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.\n    } else {\n      // Sorry! No Web Storage support..\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n49. ### How do you check web workers browser support\n\n    You need to check browser support for web workers before using it\n\n    ```javascript\n    if (typeof Worker !== \"undefined\") {\n      // code for Web worker support.\n    } else {\n      // Sorry! No Web Worker support..\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n50. ### Give an example of a web worker\n\n    You need to follow below steps to start using web workers for counting example\n\n    1. Create a Web Worker File: You need to write a script to increment the count value. Let's name it as counter.js\n\n    ```javascript\n    let i = 0;\n\n    function timedCount() {\n      i = i + 1;\n      postMessage(i);\n      setTimeout(\"timedCount()\", 500);\n    }\n\n    timedCount();\n    ```\n\n    Here postMessage() method is used to post a message back to the HTML page\n\n    2. Create a Web Worker Object: You can create a web worker object by checking for browser support. Let's name this file as web_worker_example.js\n\n    ```javascript\n    if (typeof w == \"undefined\") {\n      w = new Worker(\"counter.js\");\n    }\n    ```\n\n    and we can receive messages from web worker\n\n    ```javascript\n    w.onmessage = function (event) {\n      document.getElementById(\"message\").innerHTML = event.data;\n    };\n    ```\n\n    3. Terminate a Web Worker:\n       Web workers will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. You can use the terminate() method to terminate listening to the messages.\n\n    ```javascript\n    w.terminate();\n    ```\n\n    4. Reuse the Web Worker: If you set the worker variable to undefined you can reuse the code\n\n    ```javascript\n    w = undefined;\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n51. ### What are the restrictions of web workers on DOM\n\n    WebWorkers don't have access to below javascript objects since they are defined in an external files\n\n    1. Window object\n    2. Document object\n    3. Parent object\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n52. ### What is a promise\n    A **Promise** is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It acts as a placeholder for a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future.\n\n    A Promise can be in one of **three states**:\n    - `pending`: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.\n    - `fulfilled`: The operation completed successfully.\n    - `rejected`: The operation failed (e.g., due to a network error).\n\n\n    #### Promise Syntax\n\n    ```javascript\n    const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n      // Perform async operation\n    });\n    ```\n    #### Example: Creating and Using a Promise\n    ```javascript\n    const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        resolve(\"I'm a Promise!\");\n      }, 5000);\n    });\n\n    promise\n      .then((value) => console.log(value)) // Logs after 5 seconds: \"I'm a Promise!\"\n      .catch((error) => console.error(error))  // Handles any rejection\n      .finally(() => console.log(\"Done\"));     // Runs regardless of success or failure\n    ```\n    In the above example:\n\n    *   A `Promise` is created to handle an asynchronous operation with `resolve` and `reject` callbacks.\n    *   The `setTimeout` resolves the promise with a value after 5 seconds.\n    *   `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` are used to handle success, errors, and cleanup respectively.\n\n    The action flow of a promise will be as below,\n\n    ![Screenshot](images/promises.png)\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n53. ### Why do you need a promise\n    Promises are **used to handle asynchronous operations**, especially in languages like JavaScript, which often work with non-blocking operations such as network requests, file I/O, and timers. When an operation is asynchronous, it doesn't immediately return a result; instead, it works in the background and provides the result later. Handling this in a clean, organized way can be difficult without a structured approach.\n\n    Promises are used to:\n\n    1.  **Handle asynchronous operations**.\n    2.  **Provide a cleaner alternative to callbacks**.\n    3.  **Avoid callback hell**.\n    4.  **Make code more readable and maintainable**.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n54. ### Explain the three states of promise\n\n    Promises have three states:\n\n    1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins\n    2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.\n    3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n55. ### What is a callback function\n\n    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.\n    Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function\n\n    ```javascript\n    function callbackFunction(name) {\n      console.log(\"Hello \" + name);\n    }\n\n    function outerFunction(callback) {\n      let name = prompt(\"Please enter your name.\");\n      callback(name);\n    }\n\n    outerFunction(callbackFunction);\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n56. ### Why do we need callbacks\n\n    The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response, javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.\n    Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.\n\n    ```javascript\n    function firstFunction() {\n      // Simulate a code delay\n      setTimeout(function () {\n        console.log(\"First function called\");\n      }, 1000);\n    }\n    function secondFunction() {\n      console.log(\"Second function called\");\n    }\n    firstFunction();\n    secondFunction();\n\n    // Output:\n    // Second function called\n    // First function called\n    ```\n\n    As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n57. ### What is a callback hell\n\n    Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    async1(function(){\n        async2(function(){\n            async3(function(){\n                async4(function(){\n                    ....\n                });\n            });\n        });\n    });\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n58. ### What are server-sent events\n\n    Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection without resorting to polling. These are a one way communications channel - events flow from server to client only. This has been used in Facebook/Twitter/X updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n59. ### How do you receive server-sent event notifications\n\n    The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications. For example, you can receive messages from server as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    if (typeof EventSource !== \"undefined\") {\n      var source = new EventSource(\"sse_generator.js\");\n      source.onmessage = function (event) {\n        document.getElementById(\"output\").innerHTML += event.data + \"<br>\";\n      };\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n60. ### How do you check browser support for server-sent events\n\n    You can perform browser support for server-sent events before using it as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    if (typeof EventSource !== \"undefined\") {\n      // Server-sent events supported. Let's have some code here!\n    } else {\n      // No server-sent events supported\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n61. ### What are the events available for server sent events\n\n    Below are the list of events available for server sent events\n    | Event | Description |\n    |---- | ---------\n    | onopen | It is used when a connection to the server is opened |\n    | onmessage | This event is used when a message is received |\n    | onerror | It happens when an error occurs|\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n62. ### What are the main rules of promise\n\n    A promise must follow a specific set of rules:\n\n    1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant `.then()` method\n    2. A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state\n    3. A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.\n    4. Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n63. ### What is callback in callback\n\n    You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks. Beware, too many levels of nesting lead to [Callback hell](https://github.com/sudheerj/javascript-interview-questions?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-a-callback-hell)\n\n    ```javascript\n    loadScript(\"/script1.js\", function (script) {\n      console.log(\"first script is loaded\");\n\n      loadScript(\"/script2.js\", function (script) {\n        console.log(\"second script is loaded\");\n\n        loadScript(\"/script3.js\", function (script) {\n          console.log(\"third script is loaded\");\n          // after all scripts are loaded\n        });\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n64. ### What is promise chaining\n\n    The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,\n\n    ```javascript\n    new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n      setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);\n    })\n      .then(function (result) {\n        console.log(result); // 1\n        return result * 2;\n      })\n      .then(function (result) {\n        console.log(result); // 2\n        return result * 3;\n      })\n      .then(function (result) {\n        console.log(result); // 6\n        return result * 4;\n      });\n    ```\n\n    In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,\n\n    1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second,\n    2. After that `.then` handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result \\* 2.\n    3. After that the value passed to the next `.then` handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with result \\* 3.\n    4. Finally the value passed to the last `.then` handler by logging the result(6) and return a promise with result \\* 4.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n65. ### What is promise.all\n\n    Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected. For example, the syntax of promise.all method is below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))\n    ```\n\n    **Note:** Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n66. ### What is the purpose of the race method in promise\n\n    Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. Let's take an example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first\n\n    ```javascript\n    var promise1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n      setTimeout(resolve, 500, \"one\");\n    });\n    var promise2 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n      setTimeout(resolve, 100, \"two\");\n    });\n\n    Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function (value) {\n      console.log(value); // \"two\" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster\n    });\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n67. ### What is a strict mode in javascript\n\n    JavaScript’s \"use strict\" directive is used to opt into a stricter parsing and error-handling mode for your scripts or functions. It helps catch common bugs, makes your code more secure, and prepares it for future versions of JavaScript.\n\n    Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `\"use strict\";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode. This also enables block-scoped variables.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n68. ### Why do you need strict mode\n\n    Strict mode is useful to write \"secure\" JavaScript by notifying \"bad syntax\" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n69. ### How do you declare strict mode\n\n    The strict mode is declared by adding \"use strict\"; to the beginning of a script or a function.\n    If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.\n\n    ```javascript\n    \"use strict\";\n    x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared\n    ```\n\n    and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope\n\n    ```javascript\n    x = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.\n    myFunction();\n\n    function myFunction() {\n      \"use strict\";\n      y = 3.14; // This will cause an error\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n70. ### What is the purpose of double exclamation\n\n    The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, it will be true.\n    For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    let isIE8 = false;\n    isIE8 = !!navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);\n    console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false\n    ```\n\n    If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.\n\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/)); // returns either an Array or null\n    ```\n\n    **Note:** The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n71. ### What is the purpose of the delete operator\n\n    The delete operator is used to delete the property as well as its value.\n\n    ```javascript\n    var user = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Doe\", age: 20 };\n    delete user.age;\n\n    console.log(user); // {firstName: \"John\", lastName:\"Doe\"}\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n72. ### What is typeof operator\n\n    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.\n\n    ```javascript\n    typeof \"John Abraham\"; // Returns \"string\"\n    typeof (1 + 2); // Returns \"number\"\n    typeof [1, 2, 3]; // Returns \"object\" because all arrays are also objects\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n73. ### What is undefined property\n\n    The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or declared but not initialized at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.\n\n    ```javascript\n    var user; // Value is undefined, type is undefined\n    console.log(typeof user); //undefined\n    ```\n\n    Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.\n\n    ```javascript\n    user = undefined;\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n74. ### What is null value\n\n    The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. The type of null value is object.\n    You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.\n\n    ```javascript\n    var user = null;\n    console.log(typeof user); //object\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n75. ### What is the difference between null and undefined\n\n    Below are the main differences between null and undefined,\n\n    | Null                                                                                            | Undefined                                                                                               |\n    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    | It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.                    | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |\n    | Type of null is object                                                                          | Type of undefined is undefined                                                                          |\n    | The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.            |\n    | Indicates the absence of a value for a variable                                                 | Indicates absence of variable itself                                                                    |\n    | Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations                                     | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations                                                  |\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n76. ### What is eval\n\n    The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string. The string can be a JavaScript expression, variable, statement, or sequence of statements.\n\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(eval(\"1 + 2\")); //  3\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n77. ### What is the difference between window and document\n\n    Below are the main differences between window and document,\n\n    | Window                                                                        | Document                                                                                       |\n    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    | It is the root level element in any web page                                  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model (DOM) |\n    | By default window object is available implicitly in the page                  | You can access it via window.document or document.                                             |\n    | It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc               |\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n78. ### How do you access history in javascript\n\n    The window.history object contains the browser's history. You can load previous and next URLs in the history using back() and next() methods.\n\n    ```javascript\n    function goBack() {\n      window.history.back();\n    }\n    function goForward() {\n      window.history.forward();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Note:** You can also access history without window prefix.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n79. ### How do you detect caps lock key turned on or not\n\n    The `mouseEvent getModifierState()` is used to return a boolean value that indicates whether the specified modifier key is activated or not. The modifiers such as CapsLock, ScrollLock and NumLock are activated when they are clicked, and deactivated when they are clicked again.\n\n    Let's take an input element to detect the CapsLock on/off behavior with an example:\n\n    ```html\n    <input type=\"password\" onmousedown=\"enterInput(event)\" />\n\n    <p id=\"feedback\"></p>\n\n    <script>\n      function enterInput(e) {\n        var flag = e.getModifierState(\"CapsLock\");\n        if (flag) {\n          document.getElementById(\"feedback\").innerHTML = \"CapsLock activated\";\n        } else {\n          document.getElementById(\"feedback\").innerHTML =\n            \"CapsLock not activated\";\n        }\n      }\n    </script>\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n80. ### What is isNaN\n\n    The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.\n\n    ```javascript\n    isNaN(\"Hello\"); //true\n    isNaN(\"100\"); //false\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n81. ### What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables\n\n    Below are the major differences between undeclared(not defined) and undefined variables,\n\n    | undeclared                                                                                  | undefined                                                                              |\n    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    | These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared                              | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value                |\n    | If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned. |\n\n    ```javascript\n    var a;\n    a; // yields undefined\n\n    b; // Throws runtime error like \"Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined\"\n    ```\n    This can be confusing, because it says `not defined` instead of `not declared` (Chrome)\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n\n82. ### What are global variables\n\n    Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code without any scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable but if you omit it then it will become global variable\n\n    ```javascript\n    msg = \"Hello\"; // var is missing, it becomes global variable\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n83. ### What are the problems with global variables\n\n    The problem with global variables is the conflict of variable names of local and global scope. It is also difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n84. ### What is NaN property\n\n    The NaN property is a global property that represents \"Not-a-Number\" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases\n\n    ```javascript\n    Math.sqrt(-1);\n    parseInt(\"Hello\");\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n85. ### What is the purpose of isFinite function\n\n    The isFinite() function is used to determine whether a number is a finite, legal number. It returns false if the value is +infinity, -infinity, or NaN (Not-a-Number), otherwise it returns true.\n\n    ```javascript\n    isFinite(Infinity); // false\n    isFinite(NaN); // false\n    isFinite(-Infinity); // false\n\n    isFinite(100); // true\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n86. ### What is an event flow\n\n    Event flow refers to the order in which events are handled in the browser when a user interacts with elements on a webpage like clicking, typing, hovering, etc.\n\n    When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element, it must trigger the click event for each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global window object.\n\n    Hence, there are three phases in JavaScript’s event flow:\n\n    1. Event Capturing(Top to Bottom): The event starts from the window/document and moves down the DOM tree toward the target element.\n    2. Target phase: The event reaches the target element — the element that was actually interacted with.\n    3. Event Bubbling(Bottom to Top): The event then bubbles back up from the target element to the root.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n87. ### What is event capturing\n\n    Event capturing is a phase of event propagation in which an event is first intercepted by the outermost ancestor element, then travels downward through the DOM hierarchy until it reaches the target (innermost) element.\n\n    To handle events during the capturing phase, you need to pass `true` as the third argument to the `addEventListener` method.\n\n     ```javascript\n      <div>\n        <button class=\"child\">Hello</button>\n      </div>\n\n      <script>\n        const parent = document.querySelector(\"div\");\n        const child = document.querySelector(\".child\");\n\n        // Capturing phase: parent listener (runs first)\n        parent.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n          console.log(\"Parent (capturing)\");\n        }, true); // `true` enables capturing\n\n        // Bubbling phase: child listener (runs after)\n        child.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n          console.log(\"Child (bubbling)\");\n        });\n      </script>\n      // Parent (capturing)\n      // Child (bubbling)\n     ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n88. ### What is event bubbling\n\n    Event bubbling is a type of event propagation in which an event first triggers on the innermost target element (the one the user interacted with), and then bubbles up through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy — eventually reaching the outermost elements, like the document or window.\n\n    By default, event listeners in JavaScript are triggered during the bubbling phase, unless specified otherwise.\n\n    ```javascript\n    <div>\n      <button class=\"child\">Hello</button>\n    </div>\n\n    <script>\n      const parent = document.querySelector(\"div\");\n      const child = document.querySelector(\".child\");\n\n      // Bubbling phase (default)\n      parent.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n        console.log(\"Parent\");\n      });\n\n      child.addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n        console.log(\"Child\");\n      });\n    </script>\n    //Child\n    //Parent\n    ```\n\n    Here, at first, the event triggers on the child button. Thereafter it bubbles up and triggers the parent div's event handler.\n    \n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n\n89. ### How do you submit a form using JavaScript\n\n    You can submit a form using `document.forms[0].submit()`. All the form input's information is submitted using onsubmit event handler\n\n    ```javascript\n    function submit() {\n      document.forms[0].submit();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n90. ### How do you find operating system details\n\n    The window.navigator object contains information about the visitor's browser OS details. Some of the OS properties are available under platform property,\n\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(navigator.platform);\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n91. ### What is the difference between document load and DOMContentLoaded events\n\n    The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for assets(stylesheets, images, and subframes) to finish loading. Whereas The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources(stylesheets, images).\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n92. ### What is the difference between native, host and user objects\n\n    `Native objects` are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification. For example, String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined in the ECMAScript spec.\n    `Host objects` are objects provided by the browser or runtime environment (Node).\n\n    For example, window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc are considered as host objects.\n    `User objects` are objects defined in the javascript code. For example, User objects created for profile information.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n93. ### What are the tools or techniques used for debugging JavaScript code\n\n    You can use below tools or techniques for debugging javascript\n\n    1. Chrome Devtools\n    2. debugger statement\n    3. Good old console.log statement\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n94. ### What are the pros and cons of promises over callbacks\n\n    Below are the list of pros and cons of promises over callbacks,\n\n    **Pros:**\n\n    1. It avoids callback hell which is unreadable\n    2. Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()\n    3. Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()\n    4. Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the callback too late, too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)\n\n    **Cons:**\n\n    5. It makes little complex code\n    6. You need to load a polyfill if ES6 is not supported\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n95. ### What is the difference between an attribute and a property\n\n    Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes: `type` and `value`,\n\n    ```javascript\n    <input type=\"text\" value=\"Name:\">\n    ```\n\n    You can retrieve the attribute value as below, for example after typing \"Good morning\" into the input field:\n\n    ```javascript\n    const input = document.querySelector(\"input\");\n    console.log(input.getAttribute(\"value\")); // Good morning\n    console.log(input.value); // Good morning\n    ```\n\n    And after you change the value of the text field to \"Good evening\", it becomes like\n\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(input.getAttribute(\"value\")); // Good evening\n    console.log(input.value); // Good evening\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n96. ### What is same-origin policy\n\n    The same-origin policy is a policy that prevents JavaScript from making requests across domain boundaries. An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. If you enable this policy then it prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page using Document Object Model(DOM).\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n97. ### What is the purpose of void 0\n\n    Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primitive value. It is commonly used for HTML documents that use href=\"JavaScript:Void(0);\" within an `<a>` element. i.e, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be prevented using this expression.\n    For example, the below link notify the message without reloading the page\n\n    ```javascript\n    <a href=\"JavaScript:void(0);\" onclick=\"alert('Well done!')\">\n      Click Me!\n    </a>\n    ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n98. ### Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language\n\n    JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n99. ### Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language\n\n    Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, function & object names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n100. ### Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript\n\n      No, they are entirely two different programming languages and have nothing to do with each other. But both of them are Object Oriented Programming languages and like many other languages, they follow similar syntax for basic features(if, else, for, switch, break, continue etc).\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n101. ### What are events\n\n      Events are \"things\" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can `react` on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,\n\n      1. Web page has finished loading\n      2. Input field was changed\n      3. Button was clicked\n\n      Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,\n\n      ```javascript\n      <!doctype html>\n      <html>\n       <head>\n         <script>\n           function greeting() {\n             alert('Hello! Good morning');\n           }\n         </script>\n       </head>\n       <body>\n         <button type=\"button\" onclick=\"greeting()\">Click me</button>\n       </body>\n      </html>\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n102. ### Who created javascript\n\n      JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. Initially it was developed under the name `Mocha`, but later the language was officially called `LiveScript` when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n103. ### What is the use of preventDefault method\n\n      The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyperlink are some common use cases.\n\n      ```javascript\n      document\n        .getElementById(\"link\")\n        .addEventListener(\"click\", function (event) {\n          event.preventDefault();\n        });\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n104. ### What is the use of stopPropagation method\n\n      The stopPropagation method is used to stop the event from bubbling up the event chain. For example, the below nested divs with stopPropagation method prevents default event propagation when clicking on nested div(Div1)\n\n      ```javascript\n      <p>Click DIV1 Element</p>\n      <div onclick=\"secondFunc()\">DIV 2\n        <div onclick=\"firstFunc(event)\">DIV 1</div>\n      </div>\n\n      <script>\n      function firstFunc(event) {\n        alert(\"DIV 1\");\n        event.stopPropagation();\n      }\n\n      function secondFunc() {\n        alert(\"DIV 2\");\n      }\n      </script>\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n105. ### What are the steps involved in return false usage\n\n      The return false statement in event handlers performs the below steps,\n\n      1. First it stops the browser's default action or behaviour.\n      2. It prevents the event from propagating the DOM\n      3. Stops callback execution and returns immediately when called.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n106. ### What is BOM\n\n      The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to \"talk to\" the browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of the window. The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.\n\n      ![Screenshot](images/bom.png)\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n107. ### What is the use of setTimeout\n\n      The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,\n\n      ```javascript\n      setTimeout(function () {\n        console.log(\"Good morning\");\n      }, 2000);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n108. ### What is the use of setInterval\n\n      The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,\n\n      ```javascript\n      setInterval(function () {\n        console.log(\"Good morning\");\n      }, 2000);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n109. ### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded\n\n      JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n110. ### What is an event delegation\n\n      Event delegation is a technique for listening to events where you delegate a parent element as the listener for all of the events that happen inside it.\n\n      For example, if you wanted to detect field changes inside a specific form, you can use event delegation technique,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var form = document.querySelector(\"#registration-form\");\n\n      // Listen for changes to fields inside the form\n      form.addEventListener(\n        \"input\",\n        function (event) {\n          // Log the field that was changed\n          console.log(event.target);\n        },\n        false\n      );\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n111. ### What is ECMAScript\n\n      ECMAScript is the scripting language that forms the basis of JavaScript. ECMAScript standardized by the ECMA International standards organization in the ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 specifications. The first edition of ECMAScript was released in 1997.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n112. ### What is JSON\n\n      JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n113. ### What are the syntax rules of JSON\n\n      Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON\n\n      1. The data is in name/value pairs\n      2. The data is separated by commas\n      3. Curly braces hold objects\n      4. Square brackets hold arrays\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n114. ### What is the purpose JSON stringify\n\n      When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var userJSON = { name: \"John\", age: 31 };\n      var userString = JSON.stringify(userJSON);\n      console.log(userString); //\"{\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":31}\"\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n115. ### How do you parse JSON string\n\n      When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var userString = '{\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":31}';\n      var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);\n      console.log(userJSON); // {name: \"John\", age: 31}\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n116. ### Why do you need JSON\n\n      When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n117. ### What are PWAs\n\n      Progressive web applications (PWAs) are a type of mobile app delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These PWAs are deployed to servers, accessible through URLs, and indexed by search engines.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n118. ### What is the purpose of clearTimeout method\n\n      The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.\n\n      For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by the clearTimeout() method.\n\n      ```javascript\n      <script>\n           var msg;\n           function greeting() {\n              alert('Good morning');\n           }\n           function start() {\n             msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);\n\n           }\n\n           function stop() {\n               clearTimeout(msg);\n           }\n      </script>\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n119. ### What is the purpose of clearInterval method\n\n      The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval.\n\n      For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by the clearInterval() method.\n\n      ```javascript\n      <script>\n           var msg;\n           function greeting() {\n              alert('Good morning');\n           }\n           function start() {\n             msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);\n\n           }\n\n           function stop() {\n               clearInterval(msg);\n           }\n      </script>\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n120. ### How do you redirect new page in javascript\n\n      In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function redirect() {\n        window.location.href = \"newPage.html\";\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n121. ### How do you check whether a string contains a substring\n\n      There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,\n\n      1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring\n\n      ```javascript\n      var mainString = \"hello\",\n        subString = \"hell\";\n      mainString.includes(subString);\n      ```\n\n      2. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var mainString = \"hello\",\n        subString = \"hell\";\n      mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;\n      ```\n\n      3. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions\n\n      ```javascript\n      var mainString = \"hello\",\n        regex = /hell/;\n      regex.test(mainString);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n122. ### How do you validate an email in javascript\n\n      You can validate an email in javascript using regular expressions. It is recommended to do validations on the server side instead of the client side. Because the javascript can be disabled on the client side.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function validateEmail(email) {\n        var re =\n          /^(([^<>()\\[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\"]+(\\.[^<>()\\[\\]\\\\.,;:\\s@\"]+)*)|(\".+\"))@((\\[[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\])|(([a-zA-Z\\-0-9]+\\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;\n        return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n      The above regular expression accepts unicode characters.\n\n123. ### How do you get the current url with javascript\n\n      You can use `window.location.href` expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. You can also use `document.URL` for read-only purposes but this solution has issues in FF.\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(\"location.href\", window.location.href); // Returns full URL\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n124. ### What are the various url properties of location object\n\n      The below `Location` object properties can be used to access URL components of the page,\n\n      1. href - The entire URL\n      2. protocol - The protocol of the URL\n      3. host - The hostname and port of the URL\n      4. hostname - The hostname of the URL\n      5. port - The port number in the URL\n      6. pathname - The path name of the URL\n      7. search - The query portion of the URL\n      8. hash - The anchor portion of the URL\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n125. ### How do get query string values in javascript\n\n      You can use URLSearchParams to get query string values in javascript. Let's see an example to get the client code value from URL query string,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);\n      const clientCode = urlParams.get(\"clientCode\");\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n126. ### How do you check if a key exists in an object\n\n      You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,\n\n      1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not\n\n         ```javascript\n         \"key\" in obj;\n         ```\n\n         and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,\n\n         ```javascript\n         !(\"key\" in obj);\n         ```\n\n      2. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)\n\n         ```javascript\n         obj.hasOwnProperty(\"key\"); // true\n         ```\n\n      3. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.\n\n         ```javascript\n         const user = {\n           name: \"John\",\n         };\n\n         console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true\n         console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false\n         ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n127. ### How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object\n\n      You can use the `for-in` loop to loop through javascript object. You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using `hasOwnProperty` method.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = {\n        k1: \"value1\",\n        k2: \"value2\",\n        k3: \"value3\",\n      };\n\n      for (var key in object) {\n        if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n          console.log(key + \" -> \" + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n128. ### How do you test for an empty object\n\n      There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions\n\n      1. **Using Object entries(ECMA 7+):** You can use object entries length along with constructor type.\n\n      ```javascript\n      Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well\n      ```\n\n      2. **Using Object keys(ECMA 5+):** You can use object keys length along with constructor type.\n\n      ```javascript\n      Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well\n      ```\n\n      3. **Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5):** You can use a for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function isEmpty(obj) {\n        for (var prop in obj) {\n          if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {\n            return false;\n          }\n        }\n\n        return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n129. ### What is an arguments object\n\n      The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. For example, let's see how to use arguments object inside sum function,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function sum() {\n        var total = 0;\n        for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {\n          total += arguments[i];\n        }\n        return total;\n      }\n\n      sum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** You can't apply array methods on arguments object. But you can convert into a regular array as below.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var argsArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n130. ### How do you make first letter of the string in an uppercase\n\n      You can create a function which uses a chain of string methods such as charAt, toUpperCase and slice methods to generate a string with the first letter in uppercase.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {\n        return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n131. ### What are the pros and cons of for loops\n\n      The for-loop is a commonly used iteration syntax in javascript. It has both pros and cons\n\n      #### Pros\n\n      1. Works on every environment\n      2. You can use break and continue flow control statements\n\n      #### Cons\n\n      3. Too verbose\n      4. Imperative\n      5. You might face off-by-one errors.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n132. ### How do you display the current date in javascript\n\n      You can use `new Date()` to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy\n\n      ```javascript\n      var today = new Date();\n      var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, \"0\");\n      var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, \"0\"); //January is 0!\n      var yyyy = today.getFullYear();\n\n      today = mm + \"/\" + dd + \"/\" + yyyy;\n      document.write(today);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n133. ### How do you compare two date objects\n\n      You need to use date.getTime() method in order to compare unix timestamp values\n\n      ```javascript\n      var d1 = new Date();\n      var d2 = new Date(d1);\n      console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); //True\n      console.log(d1 === d2); // False\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n134. ### How do you check if a string starts with another string\n\n      You can use ECMAScript 6's `String.prototype.startsWith()` method to check if a string starts with another string or not. But it is not yet supported in all browsers. Let's see an example to see this usage,\n\n      ```javascript\n      \"Good morning\".startsWith(\"Good\"); // true\n      \"Good morning\".startsWith(\"morning\"); // false\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n135. ### How do you trim a string in javascript\n\n      JavaScript provided a trim method on string types to trim any whitespaces present at the beginning or ending of the string.\n\n      ```javascript\n      \"  Hello World   \".trim(); //Hello World\n      ```\n\n      If your browser(<IE9) doesn't support this method then you can use below polyfill.\n\n      ```javascript\n      if (!String.prototype.trim) {\n        (function () {\n          // Make sure we trim BOM and NBSP\n          var rtrim = /^[\\s\\uFEFF\\xA0]+|[\\s\\uFEFF\\xA0]+$/g;\n          String.prototype.trim = function () {\n            return this.replace(rtrim, \"\");\n          };\n        })();\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n136. ### How do you add a key value pair in javascript\n\n      There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object.\n\n      Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = {\n        key1: value1,\n        key2: value2,\n      };\n      ```\n\n      1. **Using dot notation:** This solution is useful when you know the name of the property\n\n      ```javascript\n      object.key3 = \"value3\";\n      ```\n\n      2. **Using square bracket notation:** This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined or the key's name is non-JS like \"user-name\"\n\n      ```javascript\n      obj[\"key3\"] = \"value3\";\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n137. ### Is the !-- notation represents a special operator\n\n      No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,\n\n      1. A logical not (!)\n      2. A prefix decrement (--)\n\n      At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n138. ### How do you assign default values to variables\n\n      You can use the logical or operator `||` in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var a = b || c;\n      ```\n\n      As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n139. ### How do you define multiline strings\n\n      You can define multiline string literals using the '\\n' character followed by line terminator('\\').\n\n      ```javascript\n      var str = \"This is a \\n very lengthy \\n sentence!\";\n      console.log(str);\n      ```\n\n      But if you have a space after the '\\n' character, there will be indentation inconsistencies.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n140. ### What is an app shell model\n\n      An application shell (or app shell) architecture is one way to build a Progressive Web App that reliably and instantly loads on your users' screens, similar to what you see in native applications. It is useful for getting some initial HTML to the screen fast without a network.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n141. ### Can we define properties for functions\n\n      Yes, we can define properties for functions because functions are also objects.\n\n      ```javascript\n      fn = function (x) {\n        //Function code goes here\n      };\n\n      fn.name = \"John\";\n\n      fn.profile = function (y) {\n        //Profile code goes here\n      };\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n142. ### What is the way to find the number of parameters expected by a function\n\n      You can use `function.length` syntax to find the number of parameters expected by a function. Let's take an example of `sum` function to calculate the sum of numbers,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function sum(num1, num2, num3, num4) {\n        return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;\n      }\n      sum.length; // 4 is the number of parameters expected.\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n143. ### What is a polyfill\n\n      A polyfill is a piece of JS code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. For example, Silverlight plugin polyfill can be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.\n\n      There are two main polyfill libraries available,\n\n      1. **Core.js**: It is a modular javascript library used for cutting-edge ECMAScript features.\n      2. **Polyfill.io:** It provides polyfills that are required for browser needs.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n144. ### What are break and continue statements\n\n      The break statement is used to \"jump out\" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.\n\n      ```javascript\n      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        if (i === 5) {\n          break;\n        }\n        text += \"Number: \" + i + \"<br>\";\n      }\n      ```\n\n      The continue statement is used to \"jump over\" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.\n\n      ```javascript\n      for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n        if (i === 5) {\n          continue;\n        }\n        text += \"Number: \" + i + \"<br>\";\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n145. ### What are js labels\n\n      The label statement allows us to name loops and blocks in JavaScript. We can then use these labels to refer back to the code later. For example, the below code with labels avoids printing the numbers when they are same,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var i, j;\n\n      loop1: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n        loop2: for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {\n          if (i === j) {\n            continue loop1;\n          }\n          console.log(\"i = \" + i + \", j = \" + j);\n        }\n      }\n\n      // Output is:\n      //   \"i = 1, j = 0\"\n      //   \"i = 2, j = 0\"\n      //   \"i = 2, j = 1\"\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n146. ### What are the benefits of keeping declarations at the top\n\n      It is recommended to keep all declarations at the top of each script or function. The benefits of doing this are,\n\n      1. Gives cleaner code\n      2. It provides a single place to look for local variables\n      3. Easy to avoid unwanted global variables\n      4. It reduces the possibility of unwanted re-declarations\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n147. ### What are the benefits of initializing variables\n\n      It is recommended to initialize variables because of the below benefits,\n\n      1. It gives cleaner code\n      2. It provides a single place to initialize variables\n      3. Avoid undefined values in the code\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n148. ### What are the recommendations to create new object\n\n      It is recommended to avoid creating new objects using `new Object()`. Instead you can initialize values based on it's type to create the objects.\n\n      1. Assign {} instead of new Object()\n      2. Assign \"\" instead of new String()\n      3. Assign 0 instead of new Number()\n      4. Assign false instead of new Boolean()\n      5. Assign [] instead of new Array()\n      6. Assign /()/ instead of new RegExp()\n      7. Assign function (){} instead of new Function()\n\n      You can define them as an example,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var v1 = {};\n      var v2 = \"\";\n      var v3 = 0;\n      var v4 = false;\n      var v5 = [];\n      var v6 = /()/;\n      var v7 = function () {};\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n149. ### How do you define JSON arrays\n\n      JSON arrays are written inside square brackets and arrays contain javascript objects. For example, the JSON array of users would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      \"users\":[\n        {\"firstName\":\"John\", \"lastName\":\"Abrahm\"},\n        {\"firstName\":\"Anna\", \"lastName\":\"Smith\"},\n        {\"firstName\":\"Shane\", \"lastName\":\"Warn\"}\n      ]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n150. ### How do you generate random integers\n\n      You can use `Math.random()` with `Math.floor()` to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,\n\n      ```javascript\n      Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 10\n      Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 100\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive)\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n151. ### Can you write a random integers function to print integers within a range\n\n      Yes, you can create a proper random function to return a random number between min and max (both included)\n\n      ```javascript\n      function randomInteger(min, max) {\n        return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;\n      }\n      randomInteger(1, 100); // returns a random integer from 1 to 100\n      randomInteger(1, 1000); // returns a random integer from 1 to 1000\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n152. ### What is tree shaking\n\n      Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`, these days practically all bundlers use this technique.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n153. ### What is the need of tree shaking\n\n      Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n154. ### Is it recommended to use eval\n\n      No, it allows arbitrary code to be run which causes a security problem. As we know that the eval() function is used to run text as code. In most of the cases, it should not be necessary to use it.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n155. ### What is a Regular Expression\n\n      A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,\n\n      ```javascript\n      /pattern/modifiers;\n      ```\n\n      For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,\n\n      ```javascript\n      /John/i;\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n156. ### What are the string methods that accept Regular expression\n\n      There are six string methods: `search()`, `replace()`, `replaceAll()`, `match()`, `matchAll()`, and `split()`.\n\n      The `search()` method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var msg = \"Hello John\";\n      var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6\n      ```\n\n      The `replace()` and `replaceAll()` methods are used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var msg = \"ball bat\";\n      var n1 = msg.replace(/b/i, \"c\"); // call bat\n      var n2 = msg.replaceAll(/b/i, \"c\"); // call cat\n      ```\n\n      The `match()` and `matchAll()` methods are used to return the matches when matching a string against a regular expression.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var msg = \"Hello John\";\n      var n1 = msg.match(/[A-Z]/g); // [\"H\", \"J\"]\n      var n2 = msg.matchAll(/[A-Z]/g); // this returns an iterator\n      ```\n\n      The `split()` method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var msg = \"Hello John\";\n      var n = msg.split(/\\s/); // [\"Hello\", \"John\"]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n157. ### What are modifiers in regular expression\n\n      Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. Let's list some of the modifiers,\n\n      | Modifier | Description                                             |\n      | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n      | i        | Perform case-insensitive matching                       |\n      | g        | Perform a global match rather than stops at first match |\n      | m        | Perform multiline matching                              |\n\n      Let's take an example of global modifier,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var text = \"Learn JS one by one\";\n      var pattern = /one/g;\n      var result = text.match(pattern); // one,one\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n158. ### What are regular expression patterns\n\n      Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,\n\n      1. **Brackets:** These are used to find a range of characters.\n         For example, below are some use cases,\n         1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)\n         2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets\n         3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |\n      2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning.\n         For example, below are some use cases,\n         1. \\\\d: Used to find a digit\n         2. \\\\s: Used to find a whitespace character\n         3. \\\\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word\n      3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities.\n         For example, below are some use cases,\n         1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n\n         2. n\\*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n\n         3. n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n159. ### What is a RegExp object\n\n      RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods. Let's see the simple usage of RegExp object,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var regexp = new RegExp(\"\\\\w+\");\n      console.log(regexp);\n      // expected output: /\\w+/\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n160. ### How do you search a string for a pattern\n\n      You can use the `test()` method of regular expression in order to search a string for a pattern, and return true or false depending on the result.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var pattern = /you/;\n      console.log(pattern.test(\"How are you?\")); //true\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n161. ### What is the purpose of exec method\n\n      The purpose of exec method is similar to test method but it executes a search for a match in a specified string and returns a result array, or null instead of returning true/false.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var pattern = /you/;\n      console.log(pattern.exec(\"How are you?\")); //[\"you\", index: 8, input: \"How are you?\", groups: undefined]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n162. ### How do you change the style of a HTML element\n\n      You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript DOM-manipulation\n\n      1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property\n\n      ```javascript\n      document.getElementById(\"title\").style.fontSize = \"30px\";\n      ```\n\n      2. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property\n\n      ```javascript\n      document.getElementById(\"title\").className = \"custom-title\";\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n163. ### What would be the result of 1+2+'3'\n\n      The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`. Other operationrs like `3 * '3'` do yield correct results because the string is coerced into a number.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n164. ### What is a debugger statement\n\n      The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.\n      For example, in the below function a debugger statement has been inserted. So\n      execution is paused at the debugger statement just like a breakpoint in the script source.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function getProfile() {\n        // code goes here\n        debugger;\n        // code goes here\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n165. ### What is the purpose of breakpoints in debugging\n\n      You can set breakpoints in the javascript code once the debugger statement is executed and the debugger window pops up. At each breakpoint, javascript will stop executing, and let you examine the JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code using the play button.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n166. ### Can I use reserved words as identifiers\n\n      No, you cannot use the reserved words as variables, labels, object or function names. Let's see one simple example,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var else = \"hello\"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token else\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n167. ### How do you detect a mobile browser\n\n      You can use regex which returns a true or false value depending on whether or not the user is browsing with a mobile.\n\n      ```javascript\n      window.mobilecheck = function () {\n        var mobileCheck = false;\n        (function (a) {\n          if (\n            /(android|bb\\d+|meego).+mobile|avantgo|bada\\/|blackberry|blazer|compal|elaine|fennec|hiptop|iemobile|ip(hone|od)|iris|kindle|lge |maemo|midp|mmp|mobile.+firefox|netfront|opera m(ob|in)i|palm( os)?|phone|p(ixi|re)\\/|plucker|pocket|psp|series(4|6)0|symbian|treo|up\\.(browser|link)|vodafone|wap|windows ce|xda|xiino/i.test(\n              a\n            ) ||\n            /1207|6310|6590|3gso|4thp|50[1-6]i|770s|802s|a wa|abac|ac(er|oo|s\\-)|ai(ko|rn)|al(av|ca|co)|amoi|an(ex|ny|yw)|aptu|ar(ch|go)|as(te|us)|attw|au(di|\\-m|r |s )|avan|be(ck|ll|nq)|bi(lb|rd)|bl(ac|az)|br(e|v)w|bumb|bw\\-(n|u)|c55\\/|capi|ccwa|cdm\\-|cell|chtm|cldc|cmd\\-|co(mp|nd)|craw|da(it|ll|ng)|dbte|dc\\-s|devi|dica|dmob|do(c|p)o|ds(12|\\-d)|el(49|ai)|em(l2|ul)|er(ic|k0)|esl8|ez([4-7]0|os|wa|ze)|fetc|fly(\\-|_)|g1 u|g560|gene|gf\\-5|g\\-mo|go(\\.w|od)|gr(ad|un)|haie|hcit|hd\\-(m|p|t)|hei\\-|hi(pt|ta)|hp( i|ip)|hs\\-c|ht(c(\\-| |_|a|g|p|s|t)|tp)|hu(aw|tc)|i\\-(20|go|ma)|i230|iac( |\\-|\\/)|ibro|idea|ig01|ikom|im1k|inno|ipaq|iris|ja(t|v)a|jbro|jemu|jigs|kddi|keji|kgt( |\\/)|klon|kpt |kwc\\-|kyo(c|k)|le(no|xi)|lg( g|\\/(k|l|u)|50|54|\\-[a-w])|libw|lynx|m1\\-w|m3ga|m50\\/|ma(te|ui|xo)|mc(01|21|ca)|m\\-cr|me(rc|ri)|mi(o8|oa|ts)|mmef|mo(01|02|bi|de|do|t(\\-| |o|v)|zz)|mt(50|p1|v )|mwbp|mywa|n10[0-2]|n20[2-3]|n30(0|2)|n50(0|2|5)|n7(0(0|1)|10)|ne((c|m)\\-|on|tf|wf|wg|wt)|nok(6|i)|nzph|o2im|op(ti|wv)|oran|owg1|p800|pan(a|d|t)|pdxg|pg(13|\\-([1-8]|c))|phil|pire|pl(ay|uc)|pn\\-2|po(ck|rt|se)|prox|psio|pt\\-g|qa\\-a|qc(07|12|21|32|60|\\-[2-7]|i\\-)|qtek|r380|r600|raks|rim9|ro(ve|zo)|s55\\/|sa(ge|ma|mm|ms|ny|va)|sc(01|h\\-|oo|p\\-)|sdk\\/|se(c(\\-|0|1)|47|mc|nd|ri)|sgh\\-|shar|sie(\\-|m)|sk\\-0|sl(45|id)|sm(al|ar|b3|it|t5)|so(ft|ny)|sp(01|h\\-|v\\-|v )|sy(01|mb)|t2(18|50)|t6(00|10|18)|ta(gt|lk)|tcl\\-|tdg\\-|tel(i|m)|tim\\-|t\\-mo|to(pl|sh)|ts(70|m\\-|m3|m5)|tx\\-9|up(\\.b|g1|si)|utst|v400|v750|veri|vi(rg|te)|vk(40|5[0-3]|\\-v)|vm40|voda|vulc|vx(52|53|60|61|70|80|81|83|85|98)|w3c(\\-| )|webc|whit|wi(g |nc|nw)|wmlb|wonu|x700|yas\\-|your|zeto|zte\\-/i.test(\n              a.substr(0, 4)\n            )\n          )\n            mobileCheck = true;\n        })(navigator.userAgent || navigator.vendor || window.opera);\n        return mobileCheck;\n      };\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n168. ### How do you detect a mobile browser without regexp\n\n      You can detect mobile browsers by simply running through a list of devices and checking if the useragent matches anything. This is an alternative solution for RegExp usage,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function detectmob() {\n        if (\n          navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i) ||\n          navigator.userAgent.match(/webOS/i) ||\n          navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) ||\n          navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) ||\n          navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i) ||\n          navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry/i) ||\n          navigator.userAgent.match(/Windows Phone/i)\n        ) {\n          return true;\n        } else {\n          return false;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n169. ### How do you get the image width and height using JS\n\n      You can programmatically get the image and check the dimensions(width and height) using Javascript.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var img = new Image();\n      img.onload = function () {\n        console.log(this.width + \"x\" + this.height);\n      };\n      img.src = \"http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif\";\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n170. ### How do you make synchronous HTTP request\n\n      Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make synchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function httpGet(theUrl) {\n        var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        xmlHttpReq.open(\"GET\", theUrl, false); // false for synchronous request\n        xmlHttpReq.send(null);\n        return xmlHttpReq.responseText;\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n171. ### How do you make asynchronous HTTP request\n\n      Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make asynchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript by passing the 3rd parameter as true.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function httpGetAsync(theUrl, callback) {\n        var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function () {\n          if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200)\n            callback(xmlHttpReq.responseText);\n        };\n        xmlHttpReq.open(\"GET\", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous\n        xmlHttpReq.send(null);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Today this is considered deprecated, because an async `fetch` call (in browsers later than 2016) is simpler and more robust.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n172. ### How do you convert date to another timezone in javascript\n\n      You can use the toLocaleString() method to convert dates in one timezone to another. For example, let's convert current date to British English timezone as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(new Date().toLocaleString(\"en-GB\", { timeZone: \"UTC\" })); //29/06/2019, 09:56:00\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n173. ### What are the properties used to get size of window\n\n      You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight properties of windows, document element and document body objects to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these properties to calculate the size of a window or document,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var width =\n        window.innerWidth ||\n        document.documentElement.clientWidth ||\n        document.body.clientWidth;\n\n      var height =\n        window.innerHeight ||\n        document.documentElement.clientHeight ||\n        document.body.clientHeight;\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n174. ### What is a conditional operator in javascript\n\n      The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands which acts as a shortcut for `if` statements.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var isAuthenticated = false;\n      console.log(\n        isAuthenticated ? \"Hello, welcome\" : \"Sorry, you are not authenticated\"\n      ); // Sorry, you are not authenticated\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n175. ### Can you apply chaining on conditional operator\n\n      Yes, you can apply chaining on conditional operators similar to **`if … else if … else if … else`** chain. The syntax is going to be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function traceValue(someParam) {\n        return condition1\n          ? value1\n          : condition2\n          ? value2\n          : condition3\n          ? value3\n          : value4;\n      }\n\n      // The above conditional operator is equivalent to:\n\n      function traceValue(someParam) {\n        if (condition1) {\n          return value1;\n        } else if (condition2) {\n          return value2;\n        } else if (condition3) {\n          return value3;\n        } else {\n          return value4;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n176. ### What are the ways to execute javascript after a page load\n\n      You can execute javascript after page load in many different ways,\n\n      1. **window.onload:**\n\n      ```javascript\n      window.onload = function ...\n      ```\n\n      2. **document.onload:**\n\n      ```javascript\n      document.onload = function ...\n      ```\n\n      3. **body onload:**\n\n      ```javascript\n      <body onload=\"script();\">\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n177. ### What is the difference between proto and prototype\n\n      The `__proto__` object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with the `new` operator (a special variant of a function call).\n\n      ```javascript\n      new Employee().__proto__ === Employee.prototype;\n      new Employee().prototype === undefined;\n      ```\n\n      There are few more differences,\n\n      | feature    | Prototype                                                    | proto                                                      |\n      | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n      | Access     | All function constructors have prototype properties.         | All objects have \\_\\_proto\\_\\_ property                    |\n      | Purpose    | Used to reduce memory wastage with a single copy of function | Used in lookup chain to resolve methods, constructors etc. |\n      | ECMAScript | Introduced in ES6                                            | Introduced in ES5                                          |\n      | Usage      | Frequently used                                              | Rarely used                                                |\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n178. ### Can you give an example of when you really need a semicolon\n\n      It is recommended to use semicolons after every statement in JavaScript. For example, in the below case (that is an IIFE = Immediately Invoked Function Expression) it throws an error \".. is not a function\" at runtime due to missing semicolon.\n\n      ```javascript\n      // define a function\n      var fn = (function () {\n        //...\n      })(\n        // semicolon missing at this line\n\n        // then execute some code inside a closure\n        function () {\n          //...\n        }\n      )();\n      ```\n\n      and it will be interpreted as\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fn = (function () {\n        //...\n      })(function () {\n        //...\n      })();\n      ```\n\n      In this case, we are passing the second function as an argument to the first function and then trying to call the result of the first function call as a function. Hence, the second function will fail with a \"... is not a function\" error at runtime.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n179. ### What is the freeze method\n\n      The **`freeze()`** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object, prevents removing, and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const obj = {\n        prop: 100,\n      };\n\n      Object.freeze(obj);\n      obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode\n\n      console.log(obj.prop); //100\n      ```\n\n      Remember freezing is only applied to the top-level properties in objects but not for nested objects.\n      For example, let's try to freeze user object which has employment details as nested object and observe that details have been changed.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const user = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        employment: {\n          department: \"IT\",\n        },\n      };\n\n      Object.freeze(user);\n      user.employment.department = \"HR\";\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n180. ### What is the purpose of the freeze method\n\n      Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,\n\n      1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.\n      2. It is used to make an object immutable.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n181. ### Why do I need to use the freeze method\n\n      In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as the `final` keyword which is used in various languages.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n182. ### How do you detect a browser language preference\n\n      You can use the navigator object to detect a browser language preference as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var language =\n        (navigator.languages && navigator.languages[0]) || // Chrome / Firefox\n        navigator.language || // All browsers\n        navigator.userLanguage; // IE <= 10\n\n      console.log(language);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n183. ### How to convert a string to title case with javascript\n\n      Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized. You can convert a string to title case using the below function,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function toTitleCase(str) {\n        return str.replace(/\\w\\S*/g, function (txt) {\n          return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substring(1).toLowerCase();\n        });\n      }\n      toTitleCase(\"good morning john\"); // Good Morning John\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n184. ### How do you detect if javascript is disabled on the page\n\n      You can use the `<noscript>` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside `<noscript>` gets executed when JavaScript is disabled, and is typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.\n\n      ```javascript\n      <script type=\"javascript\">\n          // JS related code goes here\n      </script>\n      <noscript>\n          <a href=\"next_page.html?noJS=true\">JavaScript is disabled in the page. Please click Next Page</a>\n      </noscript>\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n185. ### What are various operators supported by javascript\n\n      An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,\n\n      1. **Arithmetic Operators:** Includes + (Addition), – (Subtraction), \\* (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), ++ (Increment) and – – (Decrement)\n      2. **Comparison Operators:** Includes == (Equal), != (Not Equal), === (Equal with type), > (Greater than), >= (Greater than or Equal to), < (Less than), <= (Less than or Equal to)\n      3. **Logical Operators:** Includes && (Logical AND), || (Logical OR), ! (Logical NOT)\n      4. **Assignment Operators:** Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), –= (Subtract and Assignment Operator), \\*= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)\n      5. **Ternary Operators:** It includes conditional(: ?) Operator\n      6. **typeof Operator:** It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like `typeof variable`\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n186. ### What is a rest parameter\n\n      Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {\n        // ...\n      }\n      ```\n\n      For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function sum(...args) {\n        let total = 0;\n        for (const i of args) {\n          total += i;\n        }\n        return total;\n      }\n\n      console.log(sum(1, 2)); //3\n      console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); //6\n      console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); //10\n      console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); //15\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n187. ### What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument\n\n      The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function someFunc(a,…b,c){\n      //You code goes here\n      return;\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n188. ### What are the bitwise operators available in javascript\n\n      Below are the list of bitwise logical operators used in JavaScript\n\n      1. Bitwise AND ( & )\n      2. Bitwise OR ( | )\n      3. Bitwise XOR ( ^ )\n      4. Bitwise NOT ( ~ )\n      5. Left Shift ( << )\n      6. Sign Propagating Right Shift ( >> )\n      7. Zero fill Right Shift ( >>> )\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n189. ### What is a spread operator\n\n      Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function calculateSum(x, y, z) {\n        return x + y + z;\n      }\n\n      const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n      console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n190. ### How do you determine whether object is frozen or not\n\n      `Object.isFrozen()` method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,\n\n      1. If it is not extensible.\n      2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.\n      3. If all its data properties are non-writable.\n         The usage is going to be as follows,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const object = {\n        property: \"Welcome JS world\",\n      };\n      Object.freeze(object);\n      console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n191. ### How do you determine two values same or not using object\n\n      The `Object.is()` method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,\n\n      ```javascript\n      Object.is(\"hello\", \"hello\"); // true\n      Object.is(window, window); // true\n      Object.is([], []); // false\n      ```\n\n      Two values are considered identical if one of the following holds:\n\n      1. both undefined\n      2. both null\n      3. both true or both false\n      4. both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order\n      5. both the same object (means both object have same reference)\n      6. both numbers and\n         both +0\n         both -0\n         both NaN\n         both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n192. ### What is the purpose of using object is method\n\n      Some of the applications of Object's `is` method are follows,\n\n      1. It is used for comparison of two strings.\n      2. It is used for comparison of two numbers.\n      3. It is used for comparing the polarity of two numbers.\n      4. It is used for comparison of two objects.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n193. ### How do you copy properties from one object to other\n\n      You can use the `Object.assign()` method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the source objects. The syntax would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      Object.assign(target, ...sources);\n      ```\n\n      Let's take example with one source and one target object,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };\n      const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };\n\n      const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);\n\n      console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }\n\n      console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }\n      ```\n\n      As observed in the above code, there is a common property(`b`) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n194. ### What are the applications of the assign method\n\n      Below are the some of main applications of `Object.assign()` method,\n\n      1. It is used for cloning an object.\n      2. It is used to merge objects with the same properties.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n195. ### What is a proxy object\n\n      The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc.\n\n      A proxy is created with two parameters: a target object which you want to proxy and a handler object which contains methods to intercept fundamental operations. The syntax would be as follows,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var p = new Proxy(target, handler);\n      ```\n\n      Let's take a look at below examples of proxy object and how the get method which customize the lookup behavior,\n\n      ```javascript\n      //Example1:\n\n      const person = {\n        name: \"Sudheer Jonna\",\n        age: 35,\n      };\n\n      const handler = {\n        get(target, prop) {\n          if (prop === \"name\") {\n            return \"Mr. \" + target[prop];\n          }\n          return target[prop];\n        },\n      };\n\n      const proxy = new Proxy(person, handler);\n\n      //Example2:\n\n      var handler1 = {\n        get: function (obj, prop) {\n          return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : 100;\n        },\n      };\n\n      var p = new Proxy({}, handler1);\n      p.a = 10;\n      p.b = null;\n\n      console.log(p.a, p.b); // 10, null\n      console.log(\"c\" in p, p.c); // false, 100\n      ```\n\n      In the above code, it uses `get` handler which define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it. These proxies are mainly used for some of the below cross-cutting concerns.\n\n      1. Logging\n      2. Authentication or Authorization\n      3. Data binding and observables\n      4. Function parameter validation\n\n      **Note:** This feature was introduced with ES6.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n196. ### What is the purpose of the seal method\n\n      The `Object.seal()` method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But **values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable**. The next level of immutability would be the [`Object.freeze()`](#what-is-a-freeze-method) method. Let's see the below example to understand more about `seal()` method\n\n      ```javascript\n      const object = {\n        property: \"Welcome JS world\",\n      };\n      Object.seal(object);\n      object.property = \"Welcome to object world\";\n      console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // true\n      delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed\n      console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n197. ### What are the applications of the seal method\n\n      Below are the main applications of `Object.seal()` method,\n\n      1. It is used for sealing objects and arrays.\n      2. It is used to make properties of an object non-configurable.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n198. ### What are the differences between the freeze and seal methods\n\n      If an object is frozen using the `Object.freeze()` method then its properties become immutable and no changes can be made in them whereas if an object is sealed using the `Object.seal()` method then the changes can be made in the existing properties of the object.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n199. ### How do you determine if an object is sealed or not\n\n      The `Object.isSealed()` method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true\n\n      1. If it is not extensible.\n      2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.\n      3. If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable).\n         Let's see it in the action\n\n      ```javascript\n      const object = {\n        property: \"Hello, Good morning\",\n      };\n\n      Object.seal(object); // Using seal() method to seal the object\n\n      console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // checking whether the object is sealed or not\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n200. ### How do you get enumerable key and value pairs\n\n      The `Object.entries()` method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a `for...in` loop. Let's see the functionality of `object.entries()` method in an example,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const object = {\n        a: \"Good morning\",\n        b: 100,\n      };\n\n      for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {\n        console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'\n        // b: 100\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n201. ### What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method\n\n      The `Object.values()` method's behavior is similar to `Object.entries()` method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const object = {\n        a: \"Good morning\",\n        b: 100,\n      };\n\n      for (let value of Object.values(object)) {\n        console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning \\n100'\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n202. ### How can you get the list of keys of any object\n\n      You can use the `Object.keys()` method which is used to return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const user = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        gender: \"male\",\n        age: 40,\n      };\n\n      console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n203. ### How do you create an object with a prototype\n\n      The `Object.create()` method is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. i.e, It uses an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. It returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const user = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        printInfo: function () {\n          console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);\n        },\n      };\n\n      const admin = Object.create(user);\n\n      admin.name = \"Nick\"; // Remember that \"name\" is a property set on \"admin\" but not on \"user\" object\n\n      admin.printInfo(); // My name is Nick\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n204. ### What is a WeakSet\n\n      A `WeakSet` is used to store a collection of weakly(weak references) held objects. The syntax would be as follows,\n\n      ```javascript\n      new WeakSet([iterable]);\n      ```\n\n      Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var ws = new WeakSet();\n      var user = {};\n      ws.add(user);\n      ws.has(user); // true\n      ws.delete(user); // removes user from the set\n      ws.has(user); // false, user has been removed\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n205. ### What are the differences between WeakSet and Set\n\n      The main difference is that references to objects in `Set` are strong while references to objects in `WeakSet` are weak. i.e, An object in `WeakSet` can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.\n      Other differences are:\n\n      1. `Set` can store any value whereas `WeakSet` can store only collections of objects\n      2. `WeakSet` does not have size property unlike `Set`\n      3. `WeakSet` does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.\n      4. `WeakSet` is not iterable.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n206. ### List down the collection of methods available on WeakSet\n\n      Below are the list of methods available on `WeakSet`,\n\n      1. `add(value)`: A new object is appended with the given value\n      2. `delete(value)`: Deletes the value from the collection.\n      3. `has(value)`: It returns true if the value is present in the collection, otherwise it returns false.\n\n      Let's see the functionality of all the above methods in an example,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var weakSetObject = new WeakSet();\n      var firstObject = {};\n      var secondObject = {};\n      // add(value)\n      weakSetObject.add(firstObject);\n      weakSetObject.add(secondObject);\n      console.log(weakSetObject.has(firstObject)); //true\n      weakSetObject.delete(secondObject);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n207. ### What is a WeakMap\n\n      A `WeakMap` object is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced. In this case, keys must be objects and the values can be arbitrary values. The syntax looks like the following:\n\n      ```javascript\n      new WeakMap([iterable]);\n      ```\n\n      Let's see the below example to explain it's behavior,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var ws = new WeakMap();\n      var user = {};\n      ws.set(user);\n      ws.has(user); // true\n      ws.delete(user); // removes user from the map\n      ws.has(user); // false, user has been removed\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n208. ### What are the differences between WeakMap and Map\n\n      The main difference is that references to key objects in `Map` are strong while references to key objects in `WeakMap` are weak. i.e, A key object in `WeakMap` can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it.\n      Other differences are,\n\n      1. `Map` can store any key type whereas `WeakMap` can store only collections of key objects\n      2. `WeakMap` does not have size property unlike `Map`\n      3. `WeakMap` does not have methods such as clear, keys, values, entries, forEach.\n      4. `WeakMap` is not iterable.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n209. ### List down the collection of methods available on WeakMap\n\n      Below are the list of methods available on `WeakMap`,\n\n      1. `set(key, value)`: Sets the value for the key in the `WeakMap` object. Returns the `WeakMap` object.\n      2. `delete(key)`: Removes any value associated to the key.\n      3. `has(key)`: Returns a Boolean asserting whether a value has been associated to the key in the `WeakMap` object or not.\n      4. `get(key)`: Returns the value associated to the key, or undefined if there is none.\n         Let's see the functionality of all the above methods in an example,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var weakMapObject = new WeakMap();\n      var firstObject = {};\n      var secondObject = {};\n      // set(key, value)\n      weakMapObject.set(firstObject, \"John\");\n      weakMapObject.set(secondObject, 100);\n      console.log(weakMapObject.has(firstObject)); //true\n      console.log(weakMapObject.get(firstObject)); // John\n      weakMapObject.delete(secondObject);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n210. ### What is the purpose of uneval\n\n      The `uneval()` is an builtin function which is used to create a string representation of the source code of an Object. It is a top-level function and is not associated with any object. Let's see the below example to know more about it's functionality,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var a = 1;\n      uneval(a); // returns a String containing 1\n      uneval(function user() {}); // returns \"(function user(){})\"\n      ```\n\n      The `uneval()` function has been deprecated. It is recommended to use `toString()` for functions and `JSON.stringify()` for other cases.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function user() {}\n      console.log(user.toString()); // returns \"(function user(){})\"\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n211. ### How do you encode an URL\n\n      The `encodeURI()` function is used to encode complete URI which has special characters except (, / ? : @ & = + $ #) characters.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var uri = \"https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы\";\n      var encoded = encodeURI(uri);\n      console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n212. ### How do you decode an URL\n\n      The `decodeURI()` function is used to decode a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by `encodeURI()`.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var uri = \"https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы\";\n      var encoded = encodeURI(uri);\n      console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B\n      try {\n        console.log(decodeURI(encoded)); // \"https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы\"\n      } catch (e) {\n        // catches a malformed URI\n        console.error(e);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n213. ### How do you print the contents of web page\n\n      The `window` object provides a `print()` method which is used to print the contents of the current window. It opens a Print dialog box which lets you choose between various printing options. Let's see the usage of print method in an example,\n\n      ```html\n      <input type=\"button\" value=\"Print\" onclick=\"window.print()\" />\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** In most browsers, it will block while the print dialog is open.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n214. ### What is the difference between uneval and eval\n\n      The `uneval` function returns the source of a given object; whereas the `eval` function does the opposite, by evaluating that source code in a different memory area. Let's see an example to clarify the difference,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var msg = uneval(function greeting() {\n        return \"Hello, Good morning\";\n      });\n      var greeting = eval(msg);\n      greeting(); // returns \"Hello, Good morning\"\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n215. ### What is an anonymous function\n\n      An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. The syntax would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function (optionalParameters) {\n        //do something\n      }\n\n      const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable\n        //do something\n      };\n\n      [1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function\n        //do something\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var x = function (a, b) {\n        return a * b;\n      };\n      var z = x(5, 10);\n      console.log(z); // 50\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n216. ### What is the precedence order between local and global variables\n\n      A local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. Let's see this behavior in an example.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var msg = \"Good morning\";\n      function greeting() {\n        msg = \"Good Evening\";\n        console.log(msg); // Good Evening\n      }\n      greeting();\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n217. ### What are javascript accessors\n\n      ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed properties through getters and setters. Getters uses the `get` keyword whereas Setters uses the `set` keyword.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var user = {\n        firstName: \"John\",\n        lastName: \"Abraham\",\n        language: \"en\",\n        get lang() {\n          return this.language;\n        },\n        set lang(lang) {\n          this.language = lang;\n        },\n      };\n      console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en\n      user.lang = \"fr\";\n      console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n218. ### How do you define property on Object constructor\n\n      The `Object.defineProperty()` static method is used to define a new property directly on an object, or modify an existing property on an object, and returns the object. Let's see an example to know how to define property,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const newObject = {};\n\n      Object.defineProperty(newObject, \"newProperty\", {\n        value: 100,\n        writable: false,\n      });\n\n      console.log(newObject.newProperty); // 100\n\n      newObject.newProperty = 200; // It throws an error in strict mode due to writable setting\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n219. ### What is the difference between get and defineProperty\n\n      Both have similar results unless you use classes. If you use `get` the property will be defined on the prototype of the object whereas using `Object.defineProperty()` the property will be defined on the instance it is applied to.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n220. ### What are the advantages of Getters and Setters\n\n      Below are the list of benefits of Getters and Setters,\n\n      1. They provide simpler syntax\n      2. They are used for defining computed properties, or accessors in JS.\n      3. Useful to provide equivalence relation between properties and methods\n      4. They can provide better data quality\n      5. Useful for doing things behind the scenes with the encapsulated logic.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n221. ### Can I add getters and setters using defineProperty method\n\n      Yes, You can use the `Object.defineProperty()` method to add Getters and Setters. For example, the below counter object uses increment, decrement, add and subtract properties,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var obj = { counter: 0 };\n\n      // Define getters\n      Object.defineProperty(obj, \"increment\", {\n        get: function () {\n          this.counter++;\n          return this.counter;\n        },\n      });\n      Object.defineProperty(obj, \"decrement\", {\n        get: function () {\n          this.counter--;\n          return this.counter;\n        },\n      });\n\n      // Define setters\n      Object.defineProperty(obj, \"add\", {\n        set: function (value) {\n          this.counter += value;\n        },\n      });\n      Object.defineProperty(obj, \"subtract\", {\n        set: function (value) {\n          this.counter -= value;\n        },\n      });\n\n      obj.add = 10;\n      obj.subtract = 5;\n      console.log(obj.increment); //6\n      console.log(obj.decrement); //5\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n222. ### What is the purpose of switch-case\n\n      The `switch case` statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In a few cases, using the `switch case` statement is going to be more convenient than `if-else` statements. The syntax would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      switch (expression)\n      {\n          case value1:\n              statement1;\n              break;\n          case value2:\n              statement2;\n              break;\n          .\n          .\n          case valueN:\n              statementN;\n              break;\n          default:\n              statementDefault;\n      }\n      ```\n\n      The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n223. ### What are the conventions to be followed for the usage of switch case\n\n      Below are the list of conventions should be taken care,\n\n      1. The expression can be of type either number or string.\n      2. Duplicate values are not allowed for the expression.\n      3. The default statement is optional. If the expression passed to switch does not match with any case value then the statement within default case will be executed.\n      4. The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement sequence.\n      5. The break statement is optional. But if it is omitted, the execution will continue on into the next case.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n224. ### What are primitive data types\n\n      A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has no properties or methods). There are 7 types of primitive data types.\n\n      1. string\n      2. number\n      3. boolean\n      4. null\n      5. undefined\n      6. bigint\n      7. symbol\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n225. ### What are the different ways to access object properties\n\n      There are 3 possible ways for accessing the property of an object.\n\n      1. **Dot notation:** It uses dot for accessing the properties\n\n      ```javascript\n      objectName.property;\n      ```\n\n      2. **Square brackets notation:** It uses square brackets for property access\n\n      ```javascript\n      objectName[\"property\"];\n      ```\n\n      3. **Expression notation:** It uses expression in the square brackets\n\n      ```javascript\n      objectName[expression];\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n226. ### What are the function parameter rules\n\n      JavaScript functions follow below rules for parameters,\n\n      1. The function definitions do not specify data types for parameters.\n      2. Do not perform type checking on the passed arguments.\n      3. Do not check the number of arguments received.\n         i.e, The below function follows the above rules,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {\n        console.log(parameter1); // 1\n      }\n      functionName(1);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n227. ### What is an error object\n\n      An error object is a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs. It has two properties: name and message. For example, the below function logs error details,\n\n      ```javascript\n      try {\n        greeting(\"Welcome\");\n      } catch (err) {\n        console.log(err.name + \"<br>\" + err.message);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n228. ### When do you get a syntax error\n\n      A SyntaxError is thrown if you try to evaluate code with a syntax error. For example, the below missing quote for the function parameter throws a syntax error\n\n      ```javascript\n      try {\n        eval(\"greeting('welcome)\"); // Missing ' will produce an error\n      } catch (err) {\n        console.log(err.name);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n229. ### What are the different error names from error object\n\n      There are 7 different types of error names returned from error object,\n      | Error Name | Description |\n      |---- | ---------\n      | `AggregateError` | An error indicating that multiple errors occurred |\n      | `EvalError` | An error has occurred in the eval() function |\n      | `RangeError` | An error has occurred with a number \"out of range\" |\n      | `ReferenceError` | An error due to an illegal reference|\n      | `SyntaxError` | An error due to a syntax error|\n      | `TypeError` | An error due to a type error |\n      | `URIError` | An error due to encodeURI() |\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n230. ### What are the various statements in error handling\n\n      Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,\n\n      1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors\n      2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error\n      3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.\n      4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n231. ### What are the two types of loops in javascript\n\n      1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For example, For Loop and While Loop comes under this category.\n      2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. i.e, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of test condition true or false. For example, do-while loop comes under this category.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n232. ### What is nodejs\n\n      Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. It is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n233. ### What is the Intl object\n\n      The `Intl` object is the namespace for the ECMAScript Internationalization API, which provides language sensitive string comparison, number formatting, and date and time formatting. It provides access to several constructors and language sensitive functions.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n234. ### How do you perform language specific date and time formatting\n\n      You can use the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` object which is a constructor for objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting. Let's see this behavior with an example,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var date = new Date(Date.UTC(2019, 07, 07, 3, 0, 0));\n      console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat(\"en-GB\").format(date)); // 07/08/2019\n      console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat(\"en-AU\").format(date)); // 07/08/2019\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n235. ### What is an Iterator\n\n      An iterator is an object which defines a sequence and a return value upon its termination. It implements the Iterator protocol with a `next()` method which returns an object with two properties: `value` (the next value in the sequence) and `done` (which is true if the last value in the sequence has been consumed).\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n236. ### How does synchronous iteration works\n\n      Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,\n\n      **Iterable:** It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator.\n\n      **Iterator:** It is an object returned by invoking `[Symbol.iterator]()` on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via `next()` method one by one.\n\n      **IteratorResult:** It is an object returned by `next()` method. The object contains two properties; the `value` property contains an iterated element and the `done` property determines whether the element is the last element or not.\n\n      Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below\n\n      ```javascript\n      const iterable = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"];\n      const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();\n      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'one', done: false }\n      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'two', done: false }\n      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'three', done: false }\n      console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'undefined, done: true }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n237. ### What is the event loop\n\n      The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call stack and the event queue and checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in the event queue, the event loop dequeues the event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call stack executes the event, and any additional events generated during the execution are added to the end of the event queue.\n\n      **Note:** The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n238. ### What is the call stack\n\n      Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,\n\n      1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.\n      2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.\n\n      Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format\n\n      ```javascript\n      function hungry() {\n        eatFruits();\n      }\n      function eatFruits() {\n        return \"I'm eating fruits\";\n      }\n\n      // Invoke the `hungry` function\n      hungry();\n      ```\n\n      The above code processed in a call stack as below,\n\n      3. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.\n      4. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.\n      5. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.\n      6. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.\n\n      ![Screenshot](images/call-stack.png)\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n239. ### What is the event queue\n\n      The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.\n\n      Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web API executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of a promise is moved into the microtask queue).\n\n      The event loop constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the event queue, the event loop moves the callback into the call stack. But if there is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n240. ### What is a decorator\n\n      A decorator is an expression that evaluates to a function and that takes the target, name, and decorator descriptor as arguments. Also, it optionally returns a decorator descriptor to install on the target object. Let's define admin decorator for user class at design time,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function admin(isAdmin) {\n         return function(target) {\n             target.isAdmin = isAdmin;\n         }\n      }\n\n      @admin(true)\n      class User() {\n      }\n      console.log(User.isAdmin); //true\n\n       @admin(false)\n       class User() {\n       }\n       console.log(User.isAdmin); //false\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n241. ### What are the properties of the Intl object\n\n      Below are the list of properties available on the `Intl` object,\n\n      1. **Collator:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive string comparison.\n      2. **DateTimeFormat:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive date and time formatting.\n      3. **ListFormat:** These are the objects that enable language-sensitive list formatting.\n      4. **NumberFormat:** Objects that enable language-sensitive number formatting.\n      5. **PluralRules:** Objects that enable plural-sensitive formatting and language-specific rules for plurals.\n      6. **RelativeTimeFormat:** Objects that enable language-sensitive relative time formatting.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n242. ### What is an Unary operator\n\n      The unary(+) operator is used to convert a variable to a number.If the variable cannot be converted, it will still become a number but with the value NaN. Let's see this behavior in an action.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var x = \"100\";\n      var y = +x;\n      console.log(typeof x, typeof y); // string, number\n\n      var a = \"Hello\";\n      var b = +a;\n      console.log(typeof a, typeof b, b); // string, number, NaN\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n243. ### How do you sort elements in an array\n\n      The `sort()` method is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, based on the string Unicode order. The example usage would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var months = [\"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Jan\", \"June\"];\n      months.sort();\n      console.log(months); //  [\"Aug\", \"Jan\", \"June\", \"Sep\"]\n      ```\n\n      **Beware:** `sort()` is changing the original array.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n244. ### What is the purpose of compareFunction while sorting arrays\n\n      The compareFunction is used to define the sort order. If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value.\n\n      Let's take an example to see the usage of compareFunction,\n\n      ```javascript\n      let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];\n      numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);\n      console.log(numbers); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n245. ### How do you reverse an array\n\n      You can use the `reverse()` method to reverse the elements in an array. This method is useful to sort an array in descending order. Let's see the usage of `reverse()` method in an example,\n\n      ```javascript\n      let numbers = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4];\n      numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a);\n      numbers.reverse();\n      console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n246. ### How do you find the min and max values in an array\n\n      You can use `Math.min` and `Math.max` methods on array variables to find the minimum and maximum elements within an array. Let's create two functions to find the min and max value with in an array,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];\n      function findMin(arr) {\n        return Math.min.apply(null, arr);\n      }\n      function findMax(arr) {\n        return Math.max.apply(null, arr);\n      }\n\n      console.log(findMin(marks));\n      console.log(findMax(marks));\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n247. ### How do you find the min and max values without Math functions\n\n      You can write functions which loop through an array comparing each value with the lowest value or highest value to find the min and max values. Let's create those functions to find min and max values,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var marks = [50, 20, 70, 60, 45, 30];\n      function findMin(arr) {\n        var length = arr.length;\n        var min = Infinity;\n        while (length--) {\n          if (arr[length] < min) {\n            min = arr[length];\n          }\n        }\n        return min;\n      }\n\n      function findMax(arr) {\n        var length = arr.length;\n        var max = -Infinity;\n        while (length--) {\n          if (arr[length] > max) {\n            max = arr[length];\n          }\n        }\n        return max;\n      }\n\n      console.log(findMin(marks));\n      console.log(findMax(marks));\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n248. ### What is an empty statement and purpose of it\n\n      The empty statement is a semicolon (;) indicating that no statement will be executed, even if JavaScript syntax requires one. Since there is no action with an empty statement you might think that it's usage is quite less, but the empty statement is occasionally useful when you want to create a loop that has an empty body. For example, you can initialize an array with zero values as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      // Initialize an array a\n      for (let i = 0; i < a.length; a[i++] = 0);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n249. ### How do you get the metadata of a module\n\n      You can use the `import.meta` object which is a meta-property exposing context-specific meta data to a JavaScript module. It contains information about the current module, such as the module's URL. In browsers, you might get different meta data than NodeJS.\n\n      ```javascript\n      <script type=\"module\" src=\"welcome-module.js\"></script>;\n      console.log(import.meta); // { url: \"file:///home/user/welcome-module.js\" }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n250. ### What is the comma operator\n\n      The comma operator is used to evaluate each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the last operand. This is totally different from comma usage within arrays, objects, and function arguments and parameters. For example, the usage for numeric expressions would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var x = 1;\n      x = (x++, x);\n\n      console.log(x); // 2\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n251. ### What is the advantage of the comma operator\n\n      It is normally used to include multiple expressions in a location that requires a single expression. One of the common usages of this comma operator is to supply multiple parameters in a `for` loop. For example, the below for loop uses multiple expressions in a single location using comma operator,\n\n      ```javascript\n      for (var a = 0, b =10; a <= 10; a++, b--)\n      ```\n\n      You can also use the comma operator in a return statement where it processes before returning.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function myFunction() {\n        var a = 1;\n        return (a += 10), a; // 11\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n252. ### What is typescript\n\n      TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript created by Microsoft that adds optional types, classes\n      and many other features, and compiles to plain JavaScript. Angular is built entirely in TypeScript and it is used as the primary language there. You can install it globally as\n\n      ```bash\n      npm install -g typescript\n      ```\n\n      Let's see a simple example of TypeScript usage,\n\n      ```typescript\n      function greeting(name: string): string {\n        return \"Hello, \" + name;\n      }\n\n      let user = \"Sudheer\";\n\n      console.log(greeting(user));\n      ```\n\n      The greeting method allows only string type as argument.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n253. ### What are the differences between javascript and typescript\n\n      Below are the list of differences between javascript and typescript,\n\n      | feature             | typescript                            | javascript                                      |\n      | ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n      | Language paradigm   | Object oriented programming language  | Multi-paradigm language                         |\n      | Typing support      | Supports static typing                | Dynamic typing                                  |\n      | Modules             | Supported                             | Not supported                                   |\n      | Interface           | It has interfaces concept             | Doesn't support interfaces                      |\n      | Optional parameters | Functions support optional parameters | No support of optional parameters for functions |\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n254. ### What are the advantages of typescript over javascript\n\n      Below are some of the advantages of typescript over javascript,\n\n      1. TypeScript is able to find compile time errors at the development time only and it makes sures less runtime errors. Whereas javascript is an interpreted language.\n      2. TypeScript is strongly-typed or supports static typing which allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in javascript.\n      3. TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 unlike ES6 features of javascript which may not be supported in some browsers.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n255. ### What is an object initializer\n\n      An object initializer is an expression that describes the initialization of an Object. The syntax for this expression is represented as a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}). This is also known as literal notation. It is one of the ways to create an object.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var initObject = { a: \"John\", b: 50, c: {} };\n\n      console.log(initObject.a); // John\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n256. ### What is a constructor method\n\n      The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class. If you do not specify a constructor method, a default constructor is used. The example usage of constructor would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      class Employee {\n        constructor() {\n          this.name = \"John\";\n        }\n      }\n\n      var employeeObject = new Employee();\n\n      console.log(employeeObject.name); // John\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n257. ### What happens if you write constructor more than once in a class\n\n      The \"constructor\" in a class is a special method and it should be defined only once in a class. i.e, If you write a constructor method more than once in a class it will throw a `SyntaxError` error.\n\n      ```javascript\n       class Employee {\n         constructor() {\n           this.name = \"John\";\n         }\n         constructor() {   //  Uncaught SyntaxError: A class may only have one constructor\n           this.age = 30;\n         }\n       }\n\n       var employeeObject = new Employee();\n\n       console.log(employeeObject.name);\n      ```\n\n      This constructor is called by using the special function call `new` (see example above).\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n258. ### How do you call the constructor of a parent class\n\n      You can use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of a parent class. Remember that `super()` must be called before using `this` reference. Otherwise it will cause a reference error. Let's the usage of it,\n\n      ```javascript\n      class Square extends Rectangle {\n        constructor(length) {\n          super(length, length);\n          this.name = \"Square\";\n        }\n\n        get area() {\n          return this.width * this.height;\n        }\n\n        set area(value) {\n          this.area = value;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n259. ### How do you get the prototype of an object\n\n      You can use the `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` method to return the prototype of the specified object. i.e. The value of the internal `prototype` property. If there are no inherited properties then `null` value is returned.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const newPrototype = {};\n      const newObject = Object.create(newPrototype);\n\n      console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(newObject) === newPrototype); // true\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n260. ### What happens If I pass string type for getPrototype method\n\n      In ES5, it will throw a TypeError exception if the obj parameter isn't an object. Whereas in ES2015, the parameter will be coerced to an `Object`.\n\n      ```javascript\n      // ES5\n      Object.getPrototypeOf(\"James\"); // TypeError: \"James\" is not an object\n      // ES2015\n      Object.getPrototypeOf(\"James\"); // String.prototype\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n261. ### How do you set the prototype of one object to another\n\n      You can use the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method that sets the prototype (i.e., the internal `Prototype` property) of a specified object to another object or null. For example, if you want to set prototype of a square object to rectangle object would be as follows,\n\n      ```javascript\n      Object.setPrototypeOf(Square.prototype, Rectangle.prototype);\n      Object.setPrototypeOf({}, null);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n262. ### How do you check whether an object can be extended or not\n\n      The `Object.isExtensible()` method is used to determine if an object is extendable or not. i.e, Whether it can have new properties added to it or not.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const newObject = {};\n      console.log(Object.isExtensible(newObject)); //true\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** By default, all the objects are extendable. i.e, The new properties can be added or modified.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n263. ### How do you prevent an object from being extend\n\n      The `Object.preventExtensions()` method is used to prevent new properties from ever being added to an object. In other words, it prevents future extensions to the object. Let's see the usage of this property,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const newObject = {};\n      Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // NOT extendable\n\n      try {\n        Object.defineProperty(newObject, \"newProperty\", {\n          // Adding new property\n          value: 100,\n        });\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.log(e); // TypeError: Cannot define property newProperty, object is not extensible\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n264. ### What are the different ways to make an object non-extensible\n\n      You can mark an object non-extensible in 3 ways,\n\n      1. `Object.preventExtensions`\n      2. `Object.seal`\n      3. `Object.freeze`\n\n      ```javascript\n      var newObject = {};\n\n      Object.preventExtensions(newObject); // Prevent objects are non-extensible\n      Object.isExtensible(newObject); // false\n\n      var sealedObject = Object.seal({}); // Sealed objects are non-extensible\n      Object.isExtensible(sealedObject); // false\n\n      var frozenObject = Object.freeze({}); // Frozen objects are non-extensible\n      Object.isExtensible(frozenObject); // false\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n265. ### How do you define multiple properties on an object\n\n      The `Object.defineProperties()` method is used to define new or modify existing properties directly on an object and returning the object. Let's define multiple properties on an empty object,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const newObject = {};\n\n      Object.defineProperties(newObject, {\n        newProperty1: {\n          value: \"John\",\n          writable: true,\n        },\n        newProperty2: {},\n      });\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n266. ### What is the MEAN stack\n\n      The MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) stack is the most popular open-source JavaScript software tech stack available for building dynamic web apps where you can write both the server-side and client-side halves of the web project entirely in JavaScript.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n267. ### What is obfuscation in javascript\n\n      Obfuscation is the deliberate act of creating obfuscated javascript code(i.e, source or machine code) that is difficult for humans to understand. It is something similar to encryption, but a machine can understand the code and execute it.\n      Let's see the below function before Obfuscation,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function greeting() {\n        console.log(\"Hello, welcome to JS world\");\n      }\n      ```\n\n      And after the code Obfuscation, it would be appeared as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      eval(\n        (function (p, a, c, k, e, d) {\n          e = function (c) {\n            return c;\n          };\n          if (!\"\".replace(/^/, String)) {\n            while (c--) {\n              d[c] = k[c] || c;\n            }\n            k = [\n              function (e) {\n                return d[e];\n              },\n            ];\n            e = function () {\n              return \"\\\\w+\";\n            };\n            c = 1;\n          }\n          while (c--) {\n            if (k[c]) {\n              p = p.replace(new RegExp(\"\\\\b\" + e(c) + \"\\\\b\", \"g\"), k[c]);\n            }\n          }\n          return p;\n        })(\n          \"2 1(){0.3('4, 7 6 5 8')}\",\n          9,\n          9,\n          \"console|greeting|function|log|Hello|JS|to|welcome|world\".split(\"|\"),\n          0,\n          {}\n        )\n      );\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n268. ### Why do you need Obfuscation\n\n      Below are the few reasons for Obfuscation,\n\n      1. The Code size will be reduced. So data transfers between server and client will be fast.\n      2. It hides the business logic from outside world and protects the code from others\n      3. Reverse engineering is highly difficult\n      4. The download time will be reduced\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n269. ### What is Minification\n\n      Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters(empty spaces are removed) and variables will be renamed without changing it's functionality. It is also a type of obfuscation .\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n270. ### What are the advantages of minification\n\n      Normally it is recommended to use minification for heavy traffic and intensive requirements of resources. It reduces file sizes with below benefits,\n\n      1. Decreases loading times of a web page\n      2. Saves bandwidth usages\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n271. ### What are the differences between obfuscation and Encryption\n\n      Below are the main differences between obfuscation and encryption,\n\n      | Feature            | Obfuscation                                     | Encryption                                                              |\n      | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n      | Definition         | Changing the form of any data in any other form | Changing the form of information to an unreadable format by using a key |\n      | A key to decode    | It can be decoded without any key               | It is required                                                          |\n      | Target data format | It will be converted to a complex form          | Converted into an unreadable format                                     |\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n272. ### What are the common tools used for minification\n\n      There are many online/offline tools to minify the javascript files,\n\n      1. Google's Closure Compiler\n      2. UglifyJS2\n      3. jsmin\n      4. javascript-minifier.com/\n      5. prettydiff.com\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n273. ### How do you perform form validation using javascript\n\n      JavaScript can be used to perform HTML form validation. For example, if the form field is empty, the function needs to notify, and return false, to prevent the form being submitted.\n      Lets' perform user login in an html form,\n\n      ```html\n      <form name=\"myForm\" onsubmit=\"return validateForm()\" method=\"post\">\n        User name:\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"uname\" />\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n      </form>\n      ```\n\n      And the validation on user login is below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function validateForm() {\n        var x = document.forms[\"myForm\"][\"uname\"].value;\n        if (x == \"\") {\n          alert(\"The username shouldn't be empty\");\n          return false;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n274. ### How do you perform form validation without javascript\n\n      You can perform HTML form validation automatically without using javascript. The validation enabled by applying the `required` attribute to prevent form submission when the input is empty.\n\n      ```html\n      <form method=\"post\">\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"uname\" required />\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n      </form>\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** Automatic form validation does not work in Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n275. ### What are the DOM methods available for constraint validation\n\n      The below DOM methods are available for constraint validation on an invalid input,\n\n      1. `checkValidity()`: It returns true if an input element contains valid data.\n      2. `setCustomValidity()`: It is used to set the `validationMessage` property of an input element.\n         Let's take an user login form with DOM validations\n\n      ```javascript\n      function myFunction() {\n        var userName = document.getElementById(\"uname\");\n        if (!userName.checkValidity()) {\n          document.getElementById(\"message\").innerHTML =\n            userName.validationMessage;\n        } else {\n          document.getElementById(\"message\").innerHTML =\n            \"Entered a valid username\";\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n276. ### What are the available constraint validation DOM properties\n\n      Below are the list of some of the constraint validation DOM properties available,\n\n      1. `validity`: It provides a list of boolean properties related to the validity of an input element.\n      2. `validationMessage`: It displays the message when the validity is false.\n      3. `willValidate`: It indicates if an input element will be validated or not.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n277. ### What are the validity properties\n\n      The validity property of an input element provides a set of properties related to the validity of data.\n\n      1. `customError`: It returns true, if a custom validity message is set.\n      2. `patternMismatch`: It returns true, if an element's value does not match its pattern attribute.\n      3. `rangeOverflow`: It returns true, if an element's value is greater than its max attribute.\n      4. `rangeUnderflow`: It returns true, if an element's value is less than its min attribute.\n      5. `stepMismatch`: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to step attribute.\n      6. `tooLong`: It returns true, if an element's value exceeds its maxLength attribute.\n      7. `typeMismatch`: It returns true, if an element's value is invalid according to type attribute.\n      8. `valueMissing`: It returns true, if an element with a required attribute has no value.\n      9. `valid`: It returns true, if an element's value is valid.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n278. ### Give an example usage of the rangeOverflow property\n\n      If an element's value is greater than its max attribute then the `rangeOverflow` property is true. For example, the below form submission throws an error if the value is more than 100,\n\n      ```html\n      <input id=\"age\" type=\"number\" max=\"100\" />\n      <button onclick=\"myOverflowFunction()\">OK</button>\n      ```\n\n      ```javascript\n      function myOverflowFunction() {\n        if (document.getElementById(\"age\").validity.rangeOverflow) {\n          alert(\"The mentioned age is not allowed\");\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n279. ### Are enums available in javascript\n\n      No, javascript does not natively support enums. But there are different kinds of solutions to simulate them even though they may not provide exact equivalents. For example, you can use freeze or seal on object,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var DaysEnum = Object.freeze({\"monday\":1, \"tuesday\":2, \"wednesday\":3, ...})\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n280. ### What is an enum\n\n      An enum is a type restricting variables to one value from a predefined set of constants. JavaScript has no enums but typescript provides built-in enum support.\n\n      ```javascript\n      enum Color {\n       RED, GREEN, BLUE\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n281. ### How do you list all properties of an object\n\n      You can use the `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` method which returns an array of all properties found directly in a given object. Let's see the usage of this in an example below:\n\n      ```javascript\n      const newObject = {\n        a: 1,\n        b: 2,\n        c: 3,\n      };\n\n      console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(newObject));\n      [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n282. ### How do you get property descriptors of an object\n\n      You can use the `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors()` method which returns all own property descriptors of a given object. The example usage of this method is below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const newObject = {\n        a: 1,\n        b: 2,\n        c: 3,\n      };\n      const descriptorsObject = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(newObject);\n      console.log(descriptorsObject.a.writable); //true\n      console.log(descriptorsObject.a.configurable); //true\n      console.log(descriptorsObject.a.enumerable); //true\n      console.log(descriptorsObject.a.value); // 1\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n283. ### What are the attributes provided by a property descriptor\n\n      A property descriptor is a record which has the following attributes\n\n      1. `value`: The value associated with the property\n      2. `writable`: Determines whether the value associated with the property can be changed or not\n      3. `configurable`: Returns true if the type of this property descriptor can be changed and if the property can be deleted from the corresponding object.\n      4. `enumerable`: Determines whether the property appears during enumeration of the properties on the corresponding object or not.\n      5. `set`: A function which serves as a setter for the property\n      6. `get`: A function which serves as a getter for the property\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n284. ### How do you extend classes\n\n      The `extends` keyword is used in class declarations/expressions to create a class which is a child of another class. It can be used to subclass custom classes as well as built-in objects. The syntax would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      class ChildClass extends ParentClass { ... }\n      ```\n\n      Let's take an example of Square subclass from Polygon parent class,\n\n      ```javascript\n      class Square extends Rectangle {\n        constructor(length) {\n          super(length, length);\n          this.name = \"Square\";\n        }\n\n        get area() {\n          return this.width * this.height;\n        }\n\n        set area(value) {\n          this.area = value;\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n285. ### How do I modify the url without reloading the page\n\n      The `window.location.href` property will be helpful to modify the url but it reloads the page. HTML5 introduced the `history.pushState()` and `history.replaceState()` methods, which allow you to add and modify history entries, respectively. For example, you can use pushState as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      window.history.pushState(\"page2\", \"Title\", \"/page2.html\");\n      ```\n\n      This mechanism is used by routing libraries of frameworks like React and Angular in order to simulate the behaviour of a multi-page-website, even though they are only SPA (Single Page Applications).\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n286. ### How do you check whether or not an array includes a particular value\n\n      The `Array#includes()` method is used to determine whether an array includes a particular value among its entries by returning either true or false. Let's see an example to find an element(numeric and string) within an array.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var numericArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n      console.log(numericArray.includes(3)); // true\n\n      var stringArray = [\"green\", \"yellow\", \"blue\"];\n      console.log(stringArray.includes(\"blue\")); //true\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n287. ### How do you compare scalar arrays\n\n      You can use length and every method of arrays to compare two scalars (compared directly using `===`) arrays. The combination of these expressions can give the expected result,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const arrayFirst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n      const arraySecond = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n      console.log(\n        arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length &&\n          arrayFirst.every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])\n      ); // true\n      ```\n\n      If you would like to compare arrays irrespective of order then you should sort them before,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const arrayFirst = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5];\n      const arraySecond = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n      console.log(\n        arrayFirst.length === arraySecond.length &&\n          arrayFirst\n            .sort()\n            .every((value, index) => value === arraySecond[index])\n      ); //true\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n288. ### How to get the value from get parameters\n\n      The `new URL()` object accepts the url string and `searchParams` property of this object can be used to access the get parameters.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let urlString = \"http://www.some-domain.com/about.html?x=1&y=2&z=3\"; //window.location.href\n      let url = new URL(urlString);\n      let parameterZ = url.searchParams.get(\"z\");\n      console.log(parameterZ); // 3\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n289. ### How do you print numbers with commas as thousand separators\n\n      You can use the `Number.prototype.toLocaleString()` method which returns a string with a language-sensitive representation such as thousand separator, currency etc. of this number.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function convertToThousandFormat(x) {\n        return x.toLocaleString(); // 12,345.679\n      }\n\n      console.log(convertToThousandFormat(12345.6789));\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n290. ### What is the difference between java and javascript\n\n      Both are totally unrelated programming languages and no relation between them. Java is statically typed, compiled, runs on its own VM. Whereas Javascript is dynamically typed, interpreted, and runs in a browser and nodejs environments. Let's see the major differences in a tabular format,\n      | Feature | Java | JavaScript |\n      |---- | ---- | -----\n      | Typed | It's a strongly typed language | It's a dynamic typed language |\n      | Paradigm | Object oriented programming | Prototype based programming |\n      | Scoping | Block scoped | Function-scoped, block scoped since ES6 |\n      | Concurrency | Thread based | event based |\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n291. ### Does JavaScript support namespaces\n\n      JavaScript doesn’t support namespaces by default. So if you create any element (function, method, object, variable) then it becomes global and pollutes the global namespace. Let's take an example of defining two functions without any namespace,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function func1() {\n        console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n      }\n      function func1() {\n        console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n      }\n      func1(); // This is a second definition\n      ```\n\n      It always calls the second function definition. In this case, namespaces will solve the name collision problem.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n292. ### How do you declare a namespace\n\n      Even though JavaScript lacks namespaces, we can use Objects, an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) or `let`/`const` to create namespaces.\n\n      1. **Using Object Literal Notation:** Let's wrap variables and functions inside an Object literal which acts as a namespace. After that you can access them using object notation\n\n         ```javascript\n         var namespaceOne = {\n             function func1() {\n                 console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n             }\n         }\n         var namespaceTwo = {\n               function func1() {\n                   console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n               }\n           }\n         namespaceOne.func1(); // This is a first definition\n         namespaceTwo.func1(); // This is a second definition\n         ```\n\n      2. **Using IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression):** The outer pair of parentheses of IIFE creates a local scope for all the code inside of it and makes the anonymous function a function expression. Due to that, you can create the same function in two different function expressions to act as a namespace.\n\n         ```javascript\n         (function () {\n           function fun1() {\n             console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n           }\n           fun1();\n         })();\n\n         (function () {\n           function fun1() {\n             console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n           }\n           fun1();\n         })();\n         ```\n\n      3. **Using a block and a let/const declaration:** In ECMAScript 6, you can simply use a block and a let declaration to restrict the scope of a variable to a block.\n\n         ```javascript\n         {\n           let myFunction = function fun1() {\n             console.log(\"This is a first definition\");\n           };\n           myFunction();\n         }\n         //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n\n         {\n           let myFunction = function fun1() {\n             console.log(\"This is a second definition\");\n           };\n           myFunction();\n         }\n         //myFunction(): ReferenceError: myFunction is not defined.\n         ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n293. ### How do you invoke javascript code in an iframe from the parent page\n\n      Initially iFrame needs to be accessed using either `document.getElementBy` or `window.frames`. After that `contentWindow` property of iFrame gives the access for targetFunction\n\n      ```javascript\n      document.getElementById(\"targetFrame\").contentWindow.targetFunction();\n      window.frames[0].frameElement.contentWindow.targetFunction(); // Accessing iframe this way may not work in latest versions chrome and firefox\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n294. ### How do you get the timezone offset of a date object\n\n      You can use the `getTimezoneOffset` method of the date object. This method returns the time zone difference, in minutes, from current locale (host system settings) to UTC\n\n      ```javascript\n      var offset = new Date().getTimezoneOffset();\n      console.log(offset); // -480\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n295. ### How do you load CSS and JS files dynamically\n\n      You can create both link and script elements in the DOM and append them as child to head tag. Let's create a function to add script and style resources as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function loadAssets(filename, filetype) {\n        if (filetype == \"css\") {\n          // External CSS file\n          var fileReference = document.createElement(\"link\");\n          fileReference.setAttribute(\"rel\", \"stylesheet\");\n          fileReference.setAttribute(\"type\", \"text/css\");\n          fileReference.setAttribute(\"href\", filename);\n        } else if (filetype == \"js\") {\n          // External JavaScript file\n          var fileReference = document.createElement(\"script\");\n          fileReference.setAttribute(\"type\", \"text/javascript\");\n          fileReference.setAttribute(\"src\", filename);\n        }\n        if (typeof fileReference != \"undefined\")\n          document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(fileReference);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n296. ### What are the different methods to find HTML elements in DOM\n\n      If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you need to start with accessing the document object. Later you can use any of the below methods to find the HTML element,\n\n      1. `document.getElementById(id)`: It finds an element by Id\n      2. `document.getElementsByTagName(name)`: It finds an element by tag name (returns an node list)\n      3. `document.getElementsByClassName(name)`: It finds an element by class name (returns an node list)\n      4. `document.querySelector(cssSelector)`: It finds an element by css selector\n      5. `document.querySelectorAll(cssSelector)`: It finds all elements by css selector (returns a node list)\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n297. ### What is jQuery\n\n      jQuery is a popular cross-browser JavaScript library that provides Document Object Model (DOM) traversal, event handling, animations and AJAX interactions by minimizing the discrepancies across browsers. It is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more”. For example, you can display welcome message on the page load using jQuery as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      $(document).ready(function () {\n        // It selects the document and apply the function on page load\n        alert(\"Welcome to jQuery world\");\n      });\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** You can download it from jquery's official site or install it from CDNs, like google.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n298. ### What is V8 JavaScript engine\n\n      V8 is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine used by the Google Chrome browser, written in C++. It is also being used in the node.js project. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.\n      **Note:** It can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n299. ### Why do we call javascript as dynamic language\n\n      JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamic language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned/reassigned with values of all types.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let age = 50; // age is a number now\n      age = \"old\"; // age is a string now\n      age = true; // age is a boolean\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n300. ### What is a void operator\n\n      The `void` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns `undefined` (i.e, without returning value). The syntax would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      void expression;\n      void expression;\n      ```\n\n      Let's display a message without any redirection or reload\n\n      ```javascript\n      <a href=\"javascript:void(alert('Welcome to JS world'))\">\n        Click here to see a message\n      </a>\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** This operator is often used to obtain the undefined primitive value, using `void(0)`. Also it can be used to call asynchronous functions without waiting for the result.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n301. ### How to set the cursor to wait\n\n      The cursor can be set to wait in JavaScript by using the property `cursor`. Let's perform this behavior on page load using the below function.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function myFunction() {\n        window.document.body.style.cursor = \"wait\";\n      }\n      ```\n\n      and this function invoked on page load\n\n      ```html\n      <body onload=\"myFunction()\"></body>\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n302. ### How do you create an infinite loop\n\n      You can create infinite loops using for and while loops without using any expressions. The for loop construct or syntax is better approach in terms of ESLint and code optimizer tools,\n\n      ```javascript\n      for (;;) {}\n      while (true) {}\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n303. ### Why do you need to avoid with statement\n\n      JavaScript's with statement was intended to provide a shorthand for writing recurring accesses to objects. So it can help reduce file size by reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty. Let's take an example where it is used to avoid redundancy when accessing an object several times.\n\n      ```javascript\n      a.b.c.greeting = \"welcome\";\n      a.b.c.age = 32;\n      ```\n\n      Using `with` it turns this into:\n\n      ```javascript\n      with (a.b.c) {\n        greeting = \"welcome\";\n        age = 32;\n      }\n      ```\n\n      But this `with` statement creates performance problems since one cannot predict whether an argument will refer to a real variable or to a property inside the with argument.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n304. ### What is the output of the following for loops\n\n      ```javascript\n      for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        // global scope\n        setTimeout(() => console.log(i));\n      }\n\n      for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n        // block scope\n        setTimeout(() => console.log(i));\n      }\n      ```\n\n      The output of the above for loops is 4 4 4 4 and 0 1 2 3\n\n      **Explanation:** Due to the event queue/loop of javascript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i is declared with the `var` keyword it became a global variable and the value was equal to 4 using iteration when the time `setTimeout` function is invoked. Hence, the output of the second loop is `4 4 4 4`.\n\n      Whereas in the second loop, the variable i is declared as the `let` keyword it becomes a block scoped variable and it holds a new value(0, 1 ,2 3) for each iteration. Hence, the output of the first loop is `0 1 2 3`.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n305. ### List down some of the features of ES6\n\n      Below are the list of some new features of ES6,\n\n      1. Support for constants or immutable variables\n      2. Block-scope support for variables, constants and functions\n      3. Arrow functions\n      4. Default parameters\n      5. Rest and Spread Parameters\n      6. Template Literals\n      7. Multi-line Strings\n      8. Destructuring Assignment\n      9. Enhanced Object Literals\n      10. Promises\n      11. Classes\n      12. Modules\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n306. ### What is ES6\n\n      ES6 is the sixth edition of the javascript language and it was released in June 2015. It was initially known as ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later renamed to ECMAScript 2015. Almost all the modern browsers support ES6 but for the old browsers there are many transpilers, like Babel.js etc.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n307. ### Can I redeclare let and const variables\n\n      No, you cannot redeclare let and const variables. If you do, it throws below error\n\n      ```bash\n      Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'someVariable' has already been declared\n      ```\n\n      **Explanation:** The variable declaration with `var` keyword refers to a function scope and the variable is treated as if it were declared at the top of the enclosing scope due to hoisting feature. So all the multiple declarations contributing to the same hoisted variable without any error. Let's take an example of re-declaring variables in the same scope for both var and let/const variables.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var name = \"John\";\n      function myFunc() {\n        var name = \"Nick\";\n        var name = \"Abraham\"; // Re-assigned in the same function block\n        alert(name); // Abraham\n      }\n      myFunc();\n      alert(name); // John\n      ```\n\n      The block-scoped multi-declaration throws syntax error,\n\n      ```javascript\n      let name = \"John\";\n      function myFunc() {\n        let name = \"Nick\";\n        let name = \"Abraham\"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared\n        alert(name);\n      }\n\n      myFunc();\n      alert(name);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n308. ### Does the `const` variable make the value immutable\n\n      No, the `const` variable doesn't make the value immutable. But it disallows subsequent assignments(i.e, You can declare with assignment but can't assign another value later)\n\n      ```javascript\n      const userList = [];\n      userList.push(\"John\"); // Can mutate even though it can't re-assign\n      console.log(userList); // ['John']\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n309. ### What are default parameters\n\n      In ES5, we need to depend on logical OR operators to handle default values of function parameters. Whereas in ES6, Default function parameters feature allows parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. Let's compare the behavior with an examples,\n\n      ```javascript\n      //ES5\n      var calculateArea = function (height, width) {\n        height = height || 50;\n        width = width || 60;\n\n        return width * height;\n      };\n      console.log(calculateArea()); //300\n      ```\n\n      The default parameters makes the initialization more simpler,\n\n      ```javascript\n      //ES6\n      var calculateArea = function (height = 50, width = 60) {\n        return width * height;\n      };\n\n      console.log(calculateArea()); //300\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n310. ### What are template literals\n\n      Template literals or template strings are string literals allowing embedded expressions. These are enclosed by the back-tick (`) character instead of double or single quotes.\n      In ES6, this feature enables using dynamic expressions as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var greeting = `Welcome to JS World, Mr. ${firstName} ${lastName}.`;\n      ```\n\n      In ES5, you need break string like below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var greeting = 'Welcome to JS World, Mr. ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName.`\n      ```\n\n      **Note:** You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template literals.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n311. ### How do you write multi-line strings in template literals\n\n      In ES5, you would have to use newline escape characters('\\\\n') and concatenation symbols(+) in order to get multi-line strings.\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(\"This is string sentence 1\\n\" + \"This is string sentence 2\");\n      ```\n\n      Whereas in ES6, You don't need to mention any newline sequence character,\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(`This is string sentence\n      'This is string sentence 2`);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n312. ### What are nesting templates\n\n      The nesting template is a feature supported within template literals syntax to allow inner backticks inside a placeholder ${ } within the template. For example, the below nesting template is used to display the icons based on user permissions whereas outer template checks for platform type,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const iconStyles = `icon ${\n        isMobilePlatform()\n          ? \"\"\n          : `icon-${user.isAuthorized ? \"submit\" : \"disabled\"}`\n      }`;\n      ```\n\n      You can write the above use case without nesting template features as well. However, the nesting template feature is more compact and readable.\n\n      ```javascript\n      //Without nesting templates\n      const iconStyles = `icon ${\n        isMobilePlatform()\n          ? \"\"\n          : user.isAuthorized\n          ? \"icon-submit\"\n          : \"icon-disabled\"\n      }`;\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n313. ### What are tagged templates\n\n      Tagged templates are the advanced form of templates in which tags allow you to parse template literals with a function. The tag function accepts the first parameter as an array of strings and remaining parameters as expressions. This function can also return manipulated strings based on parameters. Let's see the usage of this tagged template behavior of an IT professional skill set in an organization,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var user1 = \"John\";\n      var skill1 = \"JavaScript\";\n      var experience1 = 15;\n\n      var user2 = \"Kane\";\n      var skill2 = \"JavaScript\";\n      var experience2 = 5;\n\n      function myInfoTag(strings, userExp, experienceExp, skillExp) {\n        var str0 = strings[0]; // \"Mr/Ms. \"\n        var str1 = strings[1]; // \" is a/an \"\n        var str2 = strings[2]; // \"in\"\n\n        var expertiseStr;\n        if (experienceExp > 10) {\n          expertiseStr = \"expert developer\";\n        } else if (skillExp > 5 && skillExp <= 10) {\n          expertiseStr = \"senior developer\";\n        } else {\n          expertiseStr = \"junior developer\";\n        }\n\n        return `${str0}${userExp}${str1}${expertiseStr}${str2}${skillExp}`;\n      }\n\n      var output1 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user1} is a/an ${experience1} in ${skill1}`;\n      var output2 = myInfoTag`Mr/Ms. ${user2} is a/an ${experience2} in ${skill2}`;\n\n      console.log(output1); // Mr/Ms. John is a/an expert developer in JavaScript\n      console.log(output2); // Mr/Ms. Kane is a/an junior developer in JavaScript\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n314. ### What are raw strings\n\n      ES6 provides a raw strings feature using the `String.raw()` method which is used to get the raw string form of template strings. This feature allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences. For example, the usage would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var calculationString = String.raw`The sum of numbers is \\n${\n        1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n      }!`;\n      console.log(calculationString); // The sum of numbers is \\n10!\n      ```\n\n      If you don't use raw strings, the newline character sequence will be processed by displaying the output in multiple lines\n\n      ```javascript\n      var calculationString = `The sum of numbers is \\n${1 + 2 + 3 + 4}!`;\n      console.log(calculationString);\n      // The sum of numbers is\n      // 10!\n      ```\n\n      Also, the raw property is available on the first argument to the tag function\n\n      ```javascript\n      function tag(strings) {\n        console.log(strings.raw[0]);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n315. ### What is destructuring assignment\n\n      The destructuring assignment is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.\n      Let's get the month values from an array using destructuring assignment\n\n      ```javascript\n      var [one, two, three] = [\"JAN\", \"FEB\", \"MARCH\"];\n\n      console.log(one); // \"JAN\"\n      console.log(two); // \"FEB\"\n      console.log(three); // \"MARCH\"\n      ```\n\n      and you can get user properties of an object using destructuring assignment,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var { name, age } = { name: \"John\", age: 32 };\n\n      console.log(name); // John\n      console.log(age); // 32\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n316. ### What are default values in destructuring assignment\n\n      A variable can be assigned a default value when the value unpacked from the array or object is undefined during destructuring assignment. It helps to avoid setting default values separately for each assignment. Let's take an example for both arrays and object use cases,\n\n      **Arrays destructuring:**\n\n      ```javascript\n      var x, y, z;\n\n      [x = 2, y = 4, z = 6] = [10];\n      console.log(x); // 10\n      console.log(y); // 4\n      console.log(z); // 6\n      ```\n\n      **Objects destructuring:**\n\n      ```javascript\n      var { x = 2, y = 4, z = 6 } = { x: 10 };\n\n      console.log(x); // 10\n      console.log(y); // 4\n      console.log(z); // 6\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n317. ### How do you swap variables in destructuring assignment\n\n      If you don't use destructuring assignment, swapping two values requires a temporary variable. Whereas using a destructuring feature, two variable values can be swapped in one destructuring expression. Let's swap two number variables in array destructuring assignment,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var x = 10,\n        y = 20;\n\n      [x, y] = [y, x];\n      console.log(x); // 20\n      console.log(y); // 10\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n318. ### What are enhanced object literals\n\n      Object literals make it easy to quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces. For example, it provides shorter syntax for common object property definition as below.\n\n      ```javascript\n      //ES6\n      var x = 10,\n        y = 20;\n      obj = { x, y };\n      console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}\n      //ES5\n      var x = 10,\n        y = 20;\n      obj = { x: x, y: y };\n      console.log(obj); // {x: 10, y:20}\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n319. ### What are dynamic imports\n\n      The dynamic imports using `import()` function syntax allows us to load modules on demand by using promises or the async/await syntax. Currently this feature is in [stage4 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import). The main advantage of dynamic imports is reduction of our bundle's sizes, the size/payload response of our requests and overall improvements in the user experience.\n      The syntax of dynamic imports would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      import(\"./Module\").then((Module) => Module.method());\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n320. ### What are the use cases for dynamic imports\n\n      Below are some of the use cases of using dynamic imports over static imports,\n\n      1. Import a module on-demand or conditionally. For example, if you want to load a polyfill on legacy browser\n\n         ```javascript\n         if (isLegacyBrowser()) {\n             import(···)\n             .then(···);\n         }\n         ```\n\n      2. Compute the module specifier at runtime. For example, you can use it for internationalization.\n\n         ```javascript\n         import(`messages_${getLocale()}.js`).then(···);\n         ```\n\n      3. Import a module from within a regular script instead a module.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n321. ### What are typed arrays\n\n      Typed arrays are array-like objects from ECMAScript 6 API for handling binary data. JavaScript provides 12 Typed array types,\n\n      1. Int8Array: An array of 8-bit signed integers\n      2. Uint8Array: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers\n      3. Uint8ClampedArray: An array of 8-bit unsigned integers clamped to 0-255\n      4. Int16Array: An array of 16-bit signed integers\n      5. Uint16Array: An array of 16-bit unsigned integers\n      6. Int32Array: An array of 32-bit signed integers\n      7. Uint32Array: An array of 32-bit unsigned integers\n      8. BigInt64Array: An array of 64-bit signed BigInts\n      9. BigUint64Array: An array of 64-bit unsigned BigInts\n      10. Float16Array: An array of 16-bit floating point numbers\n      11. Float32Array: An array of 32-bit floating point numbers\n      12. Float64Array: An array of 64-bit floating point numbers\n\n      For example, you can create an array of 8-bit signed integers as below\n\n      ```javascript\n      const a = new Int8Array();\n      // You can pre-allocate n bytes\n      const bytes = 1024;\n      const a = new Int8Array(bytes);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n322. ### What are the advantages of module loaders\n\n      The module loaders provides the below features,\n\n      1. Dynamic loading\n      2. State isolation\n      3. Global namespace isolation\n      4. Compilation hooks\n      5. Nested virtualization\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n323. ### What is collation\n\n      Collation is used for sorting a set of strings and searching within a set of strings. It is parameterized by locale and aware of Unicode. Let's take comparison and sorting features,\n\n      1. **Comparison:**\n\n      ```javascript\n      var list = [\"ä\", \"a\", \"z\"]; // In German,  \"ä\" sorts with \"a\" Whereas in Swedish, \"ä\" sorts after \"z\"\n      var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator(\"de\");\n      var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator(\"sv\");\n      console.log(l10nDE.compare(\"ä\", \"z\") === -1); // true\n      console.log(l10nSV.compare(\"ä\", \"z\") === +1); // true\n      ```\n\n      2. **Sorting:**\n\n      ```javascript\n      var list = [\"ä\", \"a\", \"z\"]; // In German,  \"ä\" sorts with \"a\" Whereas in Swedish, \"ä\" sorts after \"z\"\n      var l10nDE = new Intl.Collator(\"de\");\n      var l10nSV = new Intl.Collator(\"sv\");\n      console.log(list.sort(l10nDE.compare)); // [ \"a\", \"ä\", \"z\" ]\n      console.log(list.sort(l10nSV.compare)); // [ \"a\", \"z\", \"ä\" ]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n324. ### What is for...of statement\n\n      The for...of statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects or elements such as built-in String, Array, Array-like objects (like arguments or NodeList), TypedArray, Map, Set, and user-defined iterables. The basic usage of for...of statement on arrays would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      let arrayIterable = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];\n\n      for (let value of arrayIterable) {\n        value++;\n        console.log(value); // 11 21 31 41 51\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n325. ### What is the output of below spread operator array\n\n      ```javascript\n      [...\"John Resig\"];\n      ```\n\n      The output of the array is ['J', 'o', 'h', 'n', ' ', 'R', 'e', 's', 'i', 'g']\n\n      **Explanation:** The string is an iterable type and the spread operator within an array maps every character of an iterable to one element. Hence, each character of a string becomes an element within an Array.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n326. ### Is PostMessage secure\n\n      Yes, postMessages can be considered very secure as long as the programmer/developer is careful about checking the origin and source of an arriving message. But if you try to send/receive a message without verifying its source will create cross-site scripting attacks.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n327. ### What are the problems with postmessage target origin as wildcard\n\n      The second argument of postMessage method specifies which origin is allowed to receive the message. If you use the wildcard “\\*” as an argument then any origin is allowed to receive the message. In this case, there is no way for the sender window to know if the target window is at the target origin when sending the message. If the target window has been navigated to another origin, the other origin would receive the data. Hence, this may lead to XSS vulnerabilities.\n\n      ```javascript\n      targetWindow.postMessage(message, \"*\");\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n328. ### How do you avoid receiving postMessages from attackers\n\n      Since the listener listens for any message, an attacker can trick the application by sending a message from the attacker’s origin, which gives an impression that the receiver received the message from the actual sender’s window. You can avoid this issue by validating the origin of the message on the receiver's end using the “message.origin” attribute.\n\n      For example, let's check the sender's origin [http://www.some-sender.com](http://www.some-sender.com) on receiver side [www.some-receiver.com](www.some-receiver.com),\n\n      ```javascript\n      //Listener on http://www.some-receiver.com/\n      window.addEventListener(\"message\", function(message){\n          if(/^http://www\\.some-sender\\.com$/.test(message.origin)){\n               console.log('You received the data from valid sender', message.data);\n         }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n329. ### Can I avoid using postMessages completely\n\n      You cannot avoid using postMessages completely(or 100%). Even though your application doesn’t use postMessage considering the risks, a lot of third party scripts use postMessage to communicate with the third party service. So your application might be using postMessage without your knowledge.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n330. ### Is postMessages synchronous\n\n      The postMessages are synchronous in IE8 browser but they are asynchronous in IE9 and all other modern browsers (i.e, IE9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari).Due to this asynchronous behaviour, we use a callback mechanism when the postMessage is returned.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n331. ### What paradigm is Javascript\n\n      JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming, Object-Oriented Programming and functional programming. JavaScript supports Object-Oriented Programming with prototypical inheritance.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n332. ### What is the difference between internal and external javascript\n\n      **Internal JavaScript:** It is the source code within the script tag.\n      **External JavaScript:** The source code is stored in an external file(stored with .js extension) and referred with in the tag.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n333. ### Is JavaScript faster than server side script\n\n      Yes, JavaScript is faster than server side scripts. Because JavaScript is a client-side script it does not require any web server’s help for its computation or calculation. So JavaScript is always faster than any server-side script like ASP, PHP, etc.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n334. ### How do you get the status of a checkbox\n\n      You can apply the `checked` property on the selected checkbox in the DOM. If the value is `true` it means the checkbox is checked, otherwise it is unchecked. For example, the below HTML checkbox element can be access using javascript as below:\n\n      ```html\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"checkboxname\" value=\"Agree\" />\n      Agree the conditions\n      <br />\n      ```\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(document.getElementById(‘checkboxname’).checked); // true or false\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n335. ### What is the purpose of double tilde operator\n\n      The double tilde operator(~~) is known as double NOT bitwise operator. This operator is a slightly quicker substitute for Math.floor().\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n336. ### How do you convert character to ASCII code\n\n      You can use the `String.prototype.charCodeAt()` method to convert string characters to ASCII numbers. For example, let's find ASCII code for the first letter of 'ABC' string,\n\n      ```javascript\n      \"ABC\".charCodeAt(0); // returns 65\n      ```\n\n      Whereas `String.fromCharCode()` method converts numbers to equal ASCII characters.\n\n      ```javascript\n      String.fromCharCode(65, 66, 67); // returns 'ABC'\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n337. ### What is ArrayBuffer\n\n      An ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer. You can create it as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16); // create a buffer of length 16\n      alert(buffer.byteLength); // 16\n      ```\n\n      To manipulate an ArrayBuffer, we need to use a “view” object.\n\n      ```javascript\n      //Create a DataView referring to the buffer\n      let view = new DataView(buffer);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n338. ### What is the output of below string expression\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(\"Welcome to JS world\"[0]);\n      ```\n\n      The output of the above expression is \"W\".\n      **Explanation:** The bracket notation with specific index on a string returns the character at a specific location. Hence, it returns the character \"W\" of the string. Since this is not supported in IE7 and below versions, you may need to use the .charAt() method to get the desired result.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n339. ### What is the purpose of Error object\n\n      The Error constructor creates an error object and the instances of error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. The syntax of error object would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      new Error([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])\n      ```\n\n      You can throw user defined exceptions or errors using Error object in try...catch block as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      try {\n        if (withdraw > balance)\n          throw new Error(\"Oops! You don't have enough balance\");\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.log(e.name + \": \" + e.message);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n340. ### What is the purpose of EvalError object\n\n      The EvalError object indicates an error regarding the global `eval()` function. Even though this exception is not thrown by JavaScript anymore, the EvalError object remains for compatibility. The syntax of this expression would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      new EvalError([message[, fileName[, lineNumber]]])\n      ```\n\n      You can throw EvalError with in try...catch block as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      try {\n        throw new EvalError('Eval function error', 'someFile.js', 100);\n      } catch (e) {\n        console.log(e.message, e.name, e.fileName);              // \"Eval function error\", \"EvalError\", \"someFile.js\"\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n341. ### What are the list of cases error thrown from non-strict mode to strict mode\n\n      When you apply 'use strict'; syntax, some of the below cases will throw a SyntaxError before executing the script\n\n      1. When you use Octal syntax\n\n      ```javascript\n      var n = 022;\n      ```\n\n      2. Using `with` statement\n      3. When you use delete operator on a variable name\n      4. Using eval or arguments as variable or function argument name\n      5. When you use newly reserved keywords\n      6. When you declare a function in a block and access it from outside of the block\n\n      ```javascript\n      if (someCondition) {\n        function f() {}\n      }\n      f(); // ReferenceError: f is not defined\n      ```\n\n      Hence, the errors from above cases are helpful to avoid errors in development/production environments.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n342. ### Do all objects have prototypes\n\n      No. All objects have prototypes except two exceptions:\n      *  **Object.prototype** itself — This is the base object in the prototype chain, and **its prototype is** `null`.\n      *   **Objects created with** `**Object.create(null)**` — These are deliberately created with **no prototype**, so they don’t inherit from `Object.prototype`.\n\n      All other standard objects do have a prototype.  \n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n343. ### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument\n\n      Parameter is the variable name of a function definition whereas an argument represents the value given to a function when it is invoked. Let's explain this with a simple function\n\n      ```javascript\n      function myFunction(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {\n        console.log(arguments[0]); // \"argument1\"\n        console.log(arguments[1]); // \"argument2\"\n        console.log(arguments[2]); // \"argument3\"\n      }\n      myFunction(\"argument1\", \"argument2\", \"argument3\");\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n344. ### What is the purpose of some method in arrays\n\n      The some() method is used to test whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. The method returns a boolean value. Let's take an example to test for any odd elements,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n\n      var odd = (element) => element % 2 !== 0;\n\n      console.log(array.some(odd)); // true (the odd element exists)\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n345. ### How do you combine two or more arrays\n\n      The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays by returning a new array containing all the elements. The syntax would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      array1.concat(array2, array3, ..., arrayX)\n      ```\n\n      Let's take an example of array's concatenation with veggies and fruits arrays,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var veggies = [\"Tomato\", \"Carrot\", \"Cabbage\"];\n      var fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Pears\"];\n      var veggiesAndFruits = veggies.concat(fruits);\n      console.log(veggiesAndFruits); // Tomato, Carrot, Cabbage, Apple, Orange, Pears\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n346. ### What is the difference between Shallow and Deep copy\n\n      There are two ways to copy an object,\n\n      **Shallow Copy:**\n      Shallow copy is a bitwise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied.\n\n      **Example**\n\n      ```javascript\n      var empDetails = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        age: 25,\n        expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n      };\n      ```\n\n      to create a duplicate\n\n      ```javascript\n      var empDetailsShallowCopy = empDetails; //Shallow copying!\n      ```\n\n      if we change some property value in the duplicate one like this:\n\n      ```javascript\n      empDetailsShallowCopy.name = \"Johnson\";\n      ```\n\n      The above statement will also change the name of `empDetails`, since we have a shallow copy. That means we're losing the original data as well.\n\n      **Deep copy:**\n      A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it refers.\n\n      **Example**\n\n      ```javascript\n      var empDetails = {\n        name: \"John\",\n        age: 25,\n        expertise: \"Software Developer\",\n      };\n      ```\n\n      Create a deep copy by using the properties from the original object into new variable\n\n      ```javascript\n      var empDetailsDeepCopy = {\n        name: empDetails.name,\n        age: empDetails.age,\n        expertise: empDetails.expertise,\n      };\n      ```\n\n      Now if you change `empDetailsDeepCopy.name`, it will only affect `empDetailsDeepCopy` & not `empDetails`\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n347. ### How do you create specific number of copies of a string\n\n      The `repeat()` method is used to construct and return a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together. Remember that this method has been added to the ECMAScript 2015 specification.\n      Let's take an example of Hello string to repeat it 4 times,\n\n      ```javascript\n      \"Hello\".repeat(4); // 'HelloHelloHelloHello'\n      ```\n\n348. ### How do you return all matching strings against a regular expression\n\n      The `matchAll()` method can be used to return an iterator of all results matching a string against a regular expression. For example, the below example returns an array of matching string results against a regular expression,\n\n      ```javascript\n      let regexp = /Hello(\\d?)/g;\n      let greeting = \"Hello1Hello2Hello3\";\n\n      let greetingList = [...greeting.matchAll(regexp)];\n\n      console.log(greetingList[0][0]); //Hello1\n      console.log(greetingList[1][0]); //Hello2\n      console.log(greetingList[2][0]); //Hello3\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n349. ### How do you trim a string at the beginning or ending\n\n      The `trim` method of string prototype is used to trim on both sides of a string. But if you want to trim especially at the beginning or ending of the string then you can use `trimStart/trimLeft` and `trimEnd/trimRight` methods. Let's see an example of these methods on a greeting message,\n\n      ```javascript\n      var greeting = \"   Hello, Goodmorning!   \";\n\n      console.log(greeting); // \"   Hello, Goodmorning!   \"\n      console.log(greeting.trimStart()); // \"Hello, Goodmorning!   \"\n      console.log(greeting.trimLeft()); // \"Hello, Goodmorning!   \"\n\n      console.log(greeting.trimEnd()); // \"   Hello, Goodmorning!\"\n      console.log(greeting.trimRight()); // \"   Hello, Goodmorning!\"\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n350. ### What is the output of below console statement with unary operator\n\n      Let's take console statement with unary operator as given below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(+\"Hello\"); // NaN\n      ```\n\n      The output of the above console log statement returns NaN. Because the element is prefixed by the unary operator and the JavaScript interpreter will try to convert that element into a number type. Since the conversion fails, the value of the statement results in NaN value.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n351. ### Does javascript uses mixins\n\n      JavaScript does not have built-in support for mixins as a formal language feature. However, developers commonly implement mixins using various patterns to enable code reuse and composition.\n\n      A mixin is a way to add reusable functionality from one or more objects into a class or another object, without using classical inheritance. It promotes object composition by combining behaviors or properties from different sources into a single destination.\n\n352. ### Mixin Example using Object composition\n      ```javascript\n      // Define a mixin\n      const canEat = {\n        eat() {\n          console.log(\"Eating...\");\n        }\n      };\n\n      const canWalk = {\n        walk() {\n          console.log(\"Walking...\");\n        }\n      };\n\n      const canRead = {\n        read() {\n          console.log(\"Reading...\");\n        }\n      };\n\n      // Create a class\n      class Person {\n        constructor(name) {\n          this.name = name;\n        }\n      }\n\n      // Apply mixins\n      Object.assign(Person.prototype, canEat, canWalk, canRead);\n\n      // Use it\n      const person = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n      person.eat();  // Output: Eating...\n      person.walk(); // Output: Walking...\n      person.read(); // Output: Reading...\n      ```\n353. ### Benefits\n      - Avoids deep inheritance hierarchies\n      - Encourages composition over inheritance\n      - Promotes reusable and modular code\n  \n      Modern JavaScript favors mixin alternatives like composition, delegation, higher-order functions, and class mixins to promote reusable and modular code. Libraries like Lodash offer utilities for object composition, while frameworks like Vue.js provide built-in mixin features to promote reusable and modular code.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n354. ### What is a thunk function\n\n      A thunk is just a function which delays the evaluation of the value. It doesn’t take any arguments but gives the value whenever you invoke the thunk. i.e, It is used not to execute now but it will be sometime in the future. Let's take a synchronous example,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const add = (x, y) => x + y;\n\n      const thunk = () => add(2, 3);\n\n      thunk(); // 5\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n355. ### What are asynchronous thunks\n\n      The asynchronous thunks are useful to make network requests. Let's see an example of network requests,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function fetchData(fn) {\n        fetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\")\n          .then((response) => response.json())\n          .then((json) => fn(json));\n      }\n\n      const asyncThunk = function () {\n        return fetchData(function getData(data) {\n          console.log(data);\n        });\n      };\n\n      asyncThunk();\n      ```\n\n      The `getData` function won't be called immediately but it will be invoked only when the data is available from API endpoint. The setTimeout function is also used to make our code asynchronous. The best real time example is redux state management library which uses the asynchronous thunks to delay the actions to dispatch.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n356. ### What is the output of below function calls\n\n      **Code snippet:**\n\n      ```javascript\n      const circle = {\n        radius: 20,\n        diameter() {\n          return this.radius * 2;\n        },\n        perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this?.radius,\n      };\n      ```\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(circle.diameter());\n      console.log(circle.perimeter());\n      ```\n\n      **Output:**\n\n      The output is 40 and NaN. Remember that diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. The `this` keyword of a regular function(i.e, diameter) refers to the surrounding scope which is a class(i.e, Shape object). Whereas this keyword of perimeter function refers to the surrounding scope which is a window object. Since there is no radius property on window objects it returns an undefined value and the multiple of number value returns NaN value.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n357. ### How to remove all line breaks from a string\n\n      The easiest approach is using regular expressions to detect and replace newlines in the string. In this case, we use replace function along with string to replace with, which in our case is an empty string.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function remove_linebreaks( var message ) {\n          return message.replace( /[\\r\\n]+/gm, \"\" );\n      }\n      ```\n\n      In the above expression, g and m are for global and multiline flags.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n358. ### What is the difference between reflow and repaint\n\n      A _repaint_ occurs when changes are made which affect the visibility of an element, but not its layout. Examples of this include outline, visibility, or background color. A _reflow_ involves changes that affect the layout of a portion of the page (or the whole page). Resizing the browser window, changing the font, content changing (such as user typing text), using JavaScript methods involving computed styles, adding or removing elements from the DOM, and changing an element's classes are a few of the things that can trigger reflow. Reflow of an element causes the subsequent reflow of all child and ancestor elements as well as any elements following it in the DOM.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n359. ### What happens with negating an array\n\n      Negating an array with `!` character will coerce the array into a boolean. Since Arrays are considered to be truthy So negating it will return `false`.\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(![]); // false\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n360. ### What happens if we add two arrays\n\n      If you add two arrays together, it will convert them both to strings and concatenate them. For example, the result of adding arrays would be as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log([\"a\"] + [\"b\"]); // \"ab\"\n      console.log([] + []); // \"\"\n      console.log(![] + []); // \"false\", because ![] returns false.\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n361. ### What is the output of prepend additive operator on falsy values\n\n      If you prepend the additive(+) operator on falsy values(null, undefined, NaN, false, \"\"), the falsy value converts to a number value zero. Let's display them on browser console as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(+null); // 0\n      console.log(+undefined); // NaN\n      console.log(+false); // 0\n      console.log(+NaN); // NaN\n      console.log(+\"\"); // 0\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n362. ### How do you create self string using special characters\n\n      The self string can be formed with the combination of `[]()!+` characters. You need to remember the below conventions to achieve this pattern.\n\n      1. Since Arrays are truthful values, negating the arrays will produce false: ![] === false\n      2. As per JavaScript coercion rules, the addition of arrays together will toString them: [] + [] === \"\"\n      3. Prepend an array with + operator will convert an array to false, the negation will make it true and finally converting the result will produce value '1': +(!(+[])) === 1\n\n      By applying the above rules, we can derive below conditions\n\n      ```javascript\n      (![] + [] === \"false\" + !+[]) === 1;\n      ```\n\n      Now the character pattern would be created as below,\n\n      ```javascript\n            s               e               l               f\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n       (![] + [])[3] + (![] + [])[4] + (![] + [])[2] + (![] + [])[0]\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]] +\n      (![] + [])[+!+[]+!+[]] +\n      (![] + [])[+[]]\n      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n      (![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+[]]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n363. ### How do you remove falsy values from an array\n\n      You can apply the filter method on the array by passing Boolean as a parameter. This way it removes all falsy values(0, undefined, null, false and \"\") from the array.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const myArray = [false, null, 1, 5, undefined];\n      myArray.filter(Boolean); // [1, 5] // is same as myArray.filter(x => x);\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n364. ### How do you get unique values of an array\n\n      You can get unique values of an array with the combination of `Set` and rest expression/spread(...) syntax.\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log([...new Set([1, 2, 4, 4, 3])]); // [1, 2, 4, 3]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n365. ### What is destructuring aliases\n\n      Sometimes you would like to have a destructured variable with a different name than the property name. In that case, you'll use a `: newName` to specify a name for the variable. This process is called destructuring aliases.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const obj = { x: 1 };\n      // Grabs obj.x as as { otherName }\n      const { x: otherName } = obj;\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n366. ### How do you map the array values without using map method\n\n      You can map the array values without using the `map` method by just using the `from` method of Array. Let's map city names from Countries array,\n\n      ```javascript\n      const countries = [\n        { name: \"India\", capital: \"Delhi\" },\n        { name: \"US\", capital: \"Washington\" },\n        { name: \"Russia\", capital: \"Moscow\" },\n        { name: \"Singapore\", capital: \"Singapore\" },\n        { name: \"China\", capital: \"Beijing\" },\n        { name: \"France\", capital: \"Paris\" },\n      ];\n\n      const cityNames = Array.from(countries, ({ capital }) => capital);\n      console.log(cityNames); // ['Delhi, 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'Singapore', 'Beijing', 'Paris']\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n367. ### How do you empty an array\n\n      You can empty an array quickly by setting the array length to zero.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let cities = [\"Singapore\", \"Delhi\", \"London\"];\n      cities.length = 0; // cities becomes []\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n368. ### How do you round numbers to certain decimals\n\n      You can round numbers to a certain number of decimals using `toFixed` method from native javascript.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let pie = 3.141592653;\n      pie = pie.toFixed(3); // 3.142\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n369. ### What is the easiest way to convert an array to an object\n\n      You can convert an array to an object with the same data using spread(...) operator.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var fruits = [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"watermelon\"];\n      var fruitsObject = { ...fruits };\n      console.log(fruitsObject); // {0: \"banana\", 1: \"apple\", 2: \"orange\", 3: \"watermelon\"}\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n370. ### How do you create an array with some data\n\n      You can create an array with some data or an array with the same values using `fill` method.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var newArray = new Array(5).fill(\"0\");\n      console.log(newArray); // [\"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\"]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n371. ### What are the placeholders from console object\n\n      Below are the list of placeholders available from console object,\n\n      1. %o — It takes an object,\n      2. %s — It takes a string,\n      3. %d — It is used for a decimal or integer\n         These placeholders can be represented in the console.log as below\n\n      ```javascript\n      const user = { name: \"John\", id: 1, city: \"Delhi\" };\n      console.log(\n        \"Hello %s, your details %o are available in the object form\",\n        \"John\",\n        user\n      ); // Hello John, your details {name: \"John\", id: 1, city: \"Delhi\"} are available in object\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n372. ### Is it possible to add CSS to console messages\n\n      Yes, you can apply CSS styles to console messages similar to html text on the web page.\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(\n        \"%c The text has blue color, with large font and red background\",\n        \"color: blue; font-size: x-large; background: red\"\n      );\n      ```\n\n      The text will be displayed as below,\n      ![Screenshot](images/console-css.png)\n\n      **Note:** All CSS styles can be applied to console messages.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n373. ### What is the purpose of dir method of console object\n\n      The `console.dir()` is used to display an interactive list of the properties of the specified JavaScript object as JSON.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const user = { name: \"John\", id: 1, city: \"Delhi\" };\n      console.dir(user);\n      ```\n\n      The user object displayed in JSON representation\n      ![Screenshot](images/console-dir.png)\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n374. ### Is it possible to debug HTML elements in console\n\n      Yes, it is possible to get and debug HTML elements in the console just like inspecting elements.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const element = document.getElementsByTagName(\"body\")[0];\n      console.log(element);\n      ```\n\n      It prints the HTML element in the console,\n\n      ![Screenshot](images/console-html.png)\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n375. ### How do you display data in a tabular format using console object\n\n      The `console.table()` is used to display data in the console in a tabular format to visualize complex arrays or objects.\n\n      ```js\n      const users = [\n        { name: \"John\", id: 1, city: \"Delhi\" },\n        { name: \"Max\", id: 2, city: \"London\" },\n        { name: \"Rod\", id: 3, city: \"Paris\" },\n      ];\n      console.table(users);\n      ```\n\n      The data visualized in a table format,\n\n      ![Screenshot](images/console-table.png)\n      **Not:** Remember that `console.table()` is not supported in IE.\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n376. ### How do you verify that an argument is a Number or not\n\n      The combination of IsNaN and isFinite methods are used to confirm whether an argument is a number or not.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function isNumber(n) {\n        return !isNaN(parseFloat(n)) && isFinite(n);\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n377. ### How do you create copy to clipboard button\n\n      You need to select the content(using .select() method) of the input element and execute the copy command with execCommand (i.e, execCommand('copy')). You can also execute other system commands like cut and paste.\n\n      ```javascript\n      document.querySelector(\"#copy-button\").onclick = function () {\n        // Select the content\n        document.querySelector(\"#copy-input\").select();\n        // Copy to the clipboard\n        document.execCommand(\"copy\");\n      };\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n378. ### What is the shortcut to get timestamp\n\n      You can use `new Date().getTime()` to get the current timestamp. There is an alternative shortcut to get the value.\n\n      ```javascript\n      console.log(+new Date());\n      console.log(Date.now());\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n379. ### How do you flattening multi dimensional arrays\n\n      Flattening bi-dimensional arrays is trivial with Spread operator.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const biDimensionalArr = [11, [22, 33], [44, 55], [66, 77], 88, 99];\n      const flattenArr = [].concat(...biDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]\n      ```\n\n      But you can make it work with multi-dimensional arrays by recursive calls,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function flattenMultiArray(arr) {\n        const flattened = [].concat(...arr);\n        return flattened.some((item) => Array.isArray(item))\n          ? flattenMultiArray(flattened)\n          : flattened;\n      }\n      const multiDimensionalArr = [\n        11,\n        [22, 33],\n        [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]],\n      ];\n      const flatArr = flattenMultiArray(multiDimensionalArr); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]\n      ```\n\n      Also you can use the `flat` method of Array.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const arr = [1, [2, 3], 4, 5, [6, 7]];\n      const fllattenArr = arr.flat(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\n      // And for multiDimensional arrays\n      const multiDimensionalArr = [\n        11,\n        [22, 33],\n        [44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]],\n      ];\n      const oneStepFlat = multiDimensionalArr.flat(1); // [11, 22, 33, 44, [55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]]\n      const towStep = multiDimensionalArr.flat(2); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, [77, [88]], 99]\n      const fullyFlatArray = multiDimensionalArr.flat(Infinity); // [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n380. ### What is the easiest multi condition checking\n\n      You can use `indexOf` to compare input with multiple values instead of checking each value as one condition.\n\n      ```javascript\n      // Verbose approach\n      if (\n        input === \"first\" ||\n        input === 1 ||\n        input === \"second\" ||\n        input === 2\n      ) {\n        someFunction();\n      }\n      // Shortcut\n      if ([\"first\", 1, \"second\", 2].indexOf(input) !== -1) {\n        someFunction();\n      }\n      ```\n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n381. ### How do you capture browser back button\n\n      The `beforeunload` event is triggered when the window, the document and its resources are about to be unloaded. This event is helpful to warn users about losing the current data and detect back button event.\n\n      ```javascript\n      window.addEventListener(\"beforeunload\", () => {\n        console.log(\"Clicked browser back button\");\n      });\n      ```\n\n      You can also use `popstate` event to detect the browser back button.\n      **Note:** The history entry has been activated using `history.pushState` method.\n\n      ```javascript\n      window.addEventListener(\"popstate\", () => {\n        console.log(\"Clicked browser back button\");\n        box.style.backgroundColor = \"white\";\n      });\n\n      const box = document.getElementById(\"div\");\n\n      box.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n        box.style.backgroundColor = \"blue\";\n        window.history.pushState({}, null, null);\n      });\n      ```\n\n\n    In the preceeding code, When the box element clicked, its background color appears in blue color and changed to while color upon clicking the browser back button using `popstate` event handler. The `state` property of `popstate` contains the copy of history entry's state object.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n382. ### How do you disable right click in the web page\n\n     The right click on the page can be disabled by returning false from the `oncontextmenu` attribute on the body element.\n\n     ```html\n     <body oncontextmenu=\"return false;\"></body>\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n383. ### What are wrapper objects\n\n     Primitive Values like string,number and boolean don't have properties and methods but they are temporarily converted or coerced to an object(Wrapper object) when you try to perform actions on them. For example, if you apply toUpperCase() method on a primitive string value, it does not throw an error but returns uppercase of the string.\n\n     ```javascript\n     let name = \"john\";\n\n     console.log(name.toUpperCase()); // Behind the scenes treated as console.log(new String(name).toUpperCase());\n     ```\n\n     i.e, Every primitive except null and undefined have Wrapper Objects and the list of wrapper objects are String,Number,Boolean,Symbol and BigInt.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n384. ### What is AJAX\n\n     AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and it is a group of related technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest API etc) used to display data asynchronously. i.e. We can send data to the server and get data from the server without reloading the web page.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n385. ### What are the different ways to deal with Asynchronous Code\n\n     Below are the list of different ways to deal with Asynchronous code.\n\n     1. Callbacks\n     2. Promises\n     3. Async/await\n     4. Third-party libraries such as async.js,bluebird etc\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n386. ### How to cancel a fetch request\n\n     Until a few days back, One shortcoming of native promises is no direct way to cancel a fetch request. But the new `AbortController` from js specification allows you to use a signal to abort one or multiple fetch calls.\n     The basic flow of cancelling a fetch request would be as below,\n\n     1. Create an `AbortController` instance\n     2. Get the signal property of an instance and pass the signal as a fetch option for signal\n     3. Call the AbortController's abort property to cancel all fetches that use that signal\n        For example, passing the same signal to multiple fetch calls will cancel all requests with that signal,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const controller = new AbortController();\n     const { signal } = controller;\n\n     fetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n       .then((response) => {\n         console.log(`Request 1 is complete!`);\n       })\n       .catch((e) => {\n         if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n           // We know it's been canceled!\n         }\n       });\n\n     fetch(\"http://localhost:8000\", { signal })\n       .then((response) => {\n         console.log(`Request 2 is complete!`);\n       })\n       .catch((e) => {\n         if (e.name === \"AbortError\") {\n           // We know it's been canceled!\n         }\n       });\n\n     // Wait 2 seconds to abort both requests\n     setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 2000);\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n387. ### What is web speech API\n\n     Web speech API is used to enable modern browsers recognize and synthesize speech(i.e, voice data into web apps). This API was introduced by W3C Community in the year 2012. It has two main parts:\n\n     1. **SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition or Speech-to-Text):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond accordingly. This is accessed by the `SpeechRecognition` interface.\n        The example below shows how to use this API to get text from speech,\n\n     ```javascript\n     window.SpeechRecognition =\n       window.webkitSpeechRecognition || window.SpeechRecognition; // webkitSpeechRecognition for Chrome and SpeechRecognition for FF\n     const recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();\n     recognition.onresult = (event) => {\n       // SpeechRecognitionEvent type\n       const speechToText = event.results[0][0].transcript;\n       console.log(speechToText);\n     };\n     recognition.start();\n     ```\n\n     In this API, browser is going to ask you for permission to use your microphone\n\n     2. **SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech):** It provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input and respond. This is accessed by the `SpeechSynthesis` interface.\n        For example, the below code is used to get voice/speech from text,\n\n     ```javascript\n     if (\"speechSynthesis\" in window) {\n       var speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(\"Hello World!\");\n       speech.lang = \"en-US\";\n       window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);\n     }\n     ```\n\n     The above examples can be tested on chrome(33+) browser's developer console.\n     **Note:** This API is still a working draft and only available in Chrome and Firefox browsers(ofcourse Chrome only implemented the specification)\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n388. ### What is minimum timeout throttling\n\n     Both browser and NodeJS javascript environments throttles with a minimum delay that is greater than 0ms. That means even though setting a delay of 0ms will not happen instantaneously.\n     **Browsers:** They have a minimum delay of 4ms. This throttle occurs when successive calls are triggered due to callback nesting(certain depth) or after a certain number of successive intervals.\n     Note: The older browsers have a minimum delay of 10ms.\n     **Nodejs:** They have a minimum delay of 1ms. This throttle happens when the delay is larger than 2147483647 or less than 1.\n     The best example to explain this timeout throttling behavior is the order of below code snippet.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function runMeFirst() {\n       console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n     }\n     setTimeout(runMeFirst, 0);\n     console.log(\"Script loaded\");\n     ```\n\n     and the output would be in\n\n     ```cmd\n     Script loaded\n     My script is initialized\n     ```\n\n     If you don't use `setTimeout`, the order of logs will be sequential.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function runMeFirst() {\n       console.log(\"My script is initialized\");\n     }\n     runMeFirst();\n     console.log(\"Script loaded\");\n     ```\n\n     and the output is,\n\n     ```cmd\n     My script is initialized\n     Script loaded\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n389. ### How do you implement zero timeout in modern browsers\n\n     You can't use setTimeout(fn, 0) to execute the code immediately due to minimum delay of greater than 0ms. But you can use window.postMessage() to achieve this behavior.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n390. ### What are tasks in event loop\n\n     A task is any javascript code/program which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms such as initially starting to run a program, run an event callback, or an interval or timeout being fired. All these tasks are scheduled on a task queue.\n     Below are the list of use cases to add tasks to the task queue,\n\n     1. When a new javascript program is executed directly from console or running by the `<script>` element, the task will be added to the task queue.\n     2. When an event fires, the event callback added to task queue\n     3. When a setTimeout or setInterval is reached, the corresponding callback added to task queue\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n391. ### What is microtask\n     \n     A microtask is a type of JavaScript callback that is scheduled to run immediately after the currently executing script and before the next event loop tick. Microtasks are executed after the current task completes and before any new tasks (macrotasks) are run. This ensures a fast and predictable update cycle.\n\n     Common sources of microtasks stored in the microtask queue include:\n\n     1. **Promises:**\n        When a Promise is resolved or rejected, its `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` callbacks are placed in the microtask queue.\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve().then(() => {\n         console.log('Microtask from a Promise');\n        });\n        ```\n\n      2. **queueMicrotask():**\n     \n         A method that explicitly schedules a function to be run in the microtask queue.\n\n         ```javascript\n          queueMicrotask(() => {\n             console.log('Microtask from  queueMicrotask');\n           });\n         ```\n\n      3. **MutationObserver callbacks:**\n\n         Observers changes in the DOM and triggers a callback as a microtask.\n\n         ```javascript\n            const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {\n              console.log('Microtask from MutationObserver');\n            })\n            observer.observe(document.body, {childList: true});\n         ```\n\n      4. **await:**  \n         Await internally uses Promises, so the code after `await` is scheduled as a microtask.\n\n         ```javascript\n          async function asyncFunction() {\n            await null;\n            console.log('Microtask from Await'); // Schedule this code as microtask\n          }\n         ```\n     **Note:** All of these microtasks are processed in the same turn of the event loop.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n392. ### What are different event loops\n\n     In JavaScript, there are multiple event loops that can be used depending on the context of your application. The most common event loops are:\n\n     1. The Browser Event Loop\n     2. The Node.js Event Loop\n\n- Browser Event Loop: The Browser Event Loop is used in client-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the browser environment, such as user interactions (clicks, keypresses, etc.), HTTP requests, and other asynchronous actions.\n\n- The Node.js Event Loop is used in server-side JavaScript applications and is responsible for handling events that occur within the Node.js runtime environment, such as file I/O, network I/O, and other asynchronous actions.\n\n  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n393. ### What is the purpose of queueMicrotask\n\n     The `queueMicrotask` function is used to schedule a microtask, which is a function that will be executed asynchronously in the microtask queue. The purpose of `queueMicrotask` is to ensure that a function is executed after the current task has finished, but before the browser performs any rendering or handles user events.\n\n     Example:\n\n     ```javascript\n     console.log(\"Start\"); //1\n\n     queueMicrotask(() => {\n       console.log(\"Inside microtask\"); // 3\n     });\n\n     console.log(\"End\"); //2\n     ```\n\n     By using queueMicrotask, you can ensure that certain tasks or callbacks are executed at the earliest opportunity during the JavaScript event loop, making it useful for performing work that needs to be done asynchronously but with higher priority than regular `setTimeout` or `setInterval` callbacks.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n394. ### How do you use javascript libraries in typescript file\n\n     It is known that not all JavaScript libraries or frameworks have TypeScript declaration files. But if you still want to use libraries or frameworks in your TypeScript files without getting compilation errors, the only solution is `declare` keyword along with a variable declaration. For example, let's imagine you have a library called `customLibrary` that doesn’t have a TypeScript declaration and have a namespace called `customLibrary` in the global namespace. You can use this library in typescript code as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     declare var customLibrary;\n     ```\n\n     In the runtime, typescript will provide the type to the `customLibrary` variable as `any` type. The another alternative without using declare keyword is below\n\n     ```javascript\n     var customLibrary: any;\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n395. ### What are the differences between promises and observables\n\n     Some of the major difference in a tabular form\n\n     | Promises                                                           | Observables                                                                              |\n     | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n     | Emits only a single value at a time                                | Emits multiple values over a period of time(stream of values ranging from 0 to multiple) |\n     | Eager in nature; they are going to be called immediately           | Lazy in nature; they require subscription to be invoked                                  |\n     | Promise is always asynchronous even though it resolved immediately | Observable can be either synchronous or asynchronous                                     |\n     | Doesn't provide any operators                                      | Provides operators such as map, forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen etc        |\n     | Cannot be canceled                                                 | Canceled by using unsubscribe() method                                                   |\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n396. ### What is heap\n\n     Heap(Or memory heap) is the memory location where objects are stored when we define variables. i.e, This is the place where all the memory allocations and de-allocation take place. Both heap and call-stack are two containers of JS runtime.\n     Whenever runtime comes across variables and function declarations in the code it stores them in the Heap.\n\n     ![Screenshot](images/heap.png)\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n397. ### What is an event table\n\n     Event Table is a data structure that stores and keeps track of all the events which will be executed asynchronously like after some time interval or after the resolution of some API requests. i.e Whenever you call a setTimeout function or invoke async operation, it is added to the Event Table.\n     It doesn't not execute functions on it’s own. The main purpose of the event table is to keep track of events and send them to the Event Queue as shown in the below diagram.\n\n     ![Screenshot](images/event-table.png)\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n398. ### What is a microTask queue\n\n     Microtask Queue is the new queue where all the tasks initiated by promise objects get processed before the callback queue.\n     The microtasks queue are processed before the next rendering and painting jobs. But if these microtasks are running for a long time then it leads to visual degradation.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n399. ### What is the difference between shim and polyfill\n\n     A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment. It isn't necessarily restricted to a web application. For example, es5-shim.js is used to emulate ES5 features on older browsers (mainly pre IE9).\n     Whereas polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively.\n     In a simple sentence, a polyfill is a shim for a browser API.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n400. ### How do you detect primitive or non primitive value type\n\n     In JavaScript, primitive types include boolean, string, number, BigInt, null, Symbol and undefined. Whereas non-primitive types include the Objects. But you can easily identify them with the below function,\n\n     ```javascript\n     var myPrimitive = 30;\n     var myNonPrimitive = {};\n     function isPrimitive(val) {\n       return Object(val) !== val;\n     }\n\n     isPrimitive(myPrimitive);\n     isPrimitive(myNonPrimitive);\n     ```\n\n     If the value is a primitive data type, the Object constructor creates a new wrapper object for the value. But If the value is a non-primitive data type (an object), the Object constructor will give the same object.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n401. ### What is babel\n\n     Babel is a JavaScript transpiler to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Some of the main features are listed below,\n\n     1. Transform syntax\n     2. Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (using @babel/polyfill)\n     3. Source code transformations (or codemods)\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n402. ### Is Node.js completely single threaded\n\n     Node is a single thread, but some of the functions included in the Node.js standard library(e.g, fs module functions) are not single threaded. i.e, Their logic runs outside of the Node.js single thread to improve the speed and performance of a program.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n403. ### What are the common use cases of observables\n\n     Some of the most common use cases of observables are web sockets with push notifications, user input changes, repeating intervals, etc\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n404. ### What is RxJS\n\n     RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for implementing reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. It also provides utility functions for creating and working with observables.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n405. ### What is the difference between Function constructor and function declaration\n\n     The functions which are created with `Function constructor` do not create closures to their creation contexts but they are always created in the global scope. i.e, the function can access its own local variables and global scope variables only. Whereas function declarations can access outer function variables(closures) too.\n\n     Let's see this difference with an example,\n\n     **Function Constructor:**\n\n     ```javascript\n     var a = 100;\n     function createFunction() {\n       var a = 200;\n       return new Function(\"return a;\");\n     }\n     console.log(createFunction()()); // 100\n     ```\n\n     **Function declaration:**\n\n     ```javascript\n     var a = 100;\n     function createFunction() {\n       var a = 200;\n       return function func() {\n         return a;\n       };\n     }\n     console.log(createFunction()()); // 200\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n406. ### What is a Short circuit condition\n\n     Short circuit conditions are meant for condensed way of writing simple if statements. Let's demonstrate the scenario using an example. If you would like to login to a portal with an authentication condition, the expression would be as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     if (authenticate) {\n       loginToPorta();\n     }\n     ```\n\n     Since the javascript logical operators evaluated from left to right, the above expression can be simplified using && logical operator\n\n     ```javascript\n     authenticate && loginToPorta();\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n407. ### What is the easiest way to resize an array\n\n     The length property of an array is useful to resize or empty an array quickly. Let's apply length property on number array to resize the number of elements from 5 to 2,\n\n     ```javascript\n     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n     console.log(array.length); // 5\n\n     array.length = 2;\n     console.log(array.length); // 2\n     console.log(array); // [1,2]\n     ```\n\n     and the array can be emptied too\n\n     ```javascript\n     var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n     array.length = 0;\n     console.log(array.length); // 0\n     console.log(array); // []\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n408. ### What is an observable\n\n     An Observable is basically a function that can return a stream of values either synchronously or asynchronously to an observer over time. The consumer can get the value by calling `subscribe()` method.\n     Let's look at a simple example of an Observable\n\n     ```javascript\n     import { Observable } from \"rxjs\";\n\n     const observable = new Observable((observer) => {\n       setTimeout(() => {\n         observer.next(\"Message from a Observable!\");\n       }, 3000);\n     });\n\n     observable.subscribe((value) => console.log(value));\n     ```\n\n     ![Screenshot](images/observables.png)\n\n     **Note:** Observables are not part of the JavaScript language yet but they are being proposed to be added to the language\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n409. ### What is the difference between function and class declarations\n\n     The main difference between function declarations and class declarations is `hoisting`. The function declarations are hoisted but not class declarations.\n\n     **Classes:**\n\n     ```javascript\n     const user = new User(); // ReferenceError\n\n     class User {}\n     ```\n\n     **Constructor Function:**\n\n     ```javascript\n     const user = new User(); // No error\n\n     function User() {}\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n410. ### What is an async function\n\n     An async function is a function declared with the `async` keyword which enables asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style by avoiding promise chains. These functions can contain zero or more `await` expressions.\n\n     Let's take a below async function example,\n\n     ```javascript\n     async function logger() {\n       let data = await fetch(\"http://someapi.com/users\"); // pause until fetch returns\n       console.log(data);\n     }\n     logger();\n     ```\n\n     It is basically syntax sugar over ES2015 promises and generators.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n411. ### How do you prevent promises swallowing errors\n\n     While using asynchronous code, JavaScript’s ES6 promises can make your life a lot easier without having callback pyramids and error handling on every second line. But Promises have some pitfalls and the biggest one is swallowing errors by default.\n\n     Let's say you expect to print an error to the console for all the below cases,\n\n     ```javascript\n     Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").then(function () {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n\n     Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n\n     new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n       throw new Error(\"error\");\n     });\n     ```\n\n     But there are many modern JavaScript environments that won't print any errors. You can fix this problem in different ways,\n\n     1. **Add catch block at the end of each chain:** You can add catch block to the end of each of your promise chains\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve(\"promised value\")\n          .then(function () {\n            throw new Error(\"error\");\n          })\n          .catch(function (error) {\n            console.error(error.stack);\n          });\n        ```\n\n        But it is quite difficult to type for each promise chain and verbose too.\n\n     2. **Add done method:** You can replace first solution's then and catch blocks with done method\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.resolve(\"promised value\").done(function () {\n          throw new Error(\"error\");\n        });\n        ```\n\n        Let's say you want to fetch data using HTTP and later perform processing on the resulting data asynchronously. You can write `done` block as below,\n\n        ```javascript\n        getDataFromHttp()\n          .then(function (result) {\n            return processDataAsync(result);\n          })\n          .done(function (processed) {\n            displayData(processed);\n          });\n        ```\n\n        In future, if the processing library API changed to synchronous then you can remove `done` block as below,\n\n        ```javascript\n        getDataFromHttp().then(function (result) {\n          return displayData(processDataAsync(result));\n        });\n        ```\n\n        and then you forgot to add `done` block to `then` block leads to silent errors.\n\n     3. **Extend ES6 Promises by Bluebird:**\n        Bluebird extends the ES6 Promises API to avoid the issue in the second solution. This library has a “default” onRejection handler which will print all errors from rejected Promises to stderr. After installation, you can process unhandled rejections\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function (error) {\n          throw error;\n        });\n        ```\n\n        and discard a rejection, just handle it with an empty catch\n\n        ```javascript\n        Promise.reject(\"error value\").catch(function () {});\n        ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n412. ### What is deno\n\n     Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It solves the inherent problems of Node.Js and has been officially released in May 2018. Unlike Node.JS, by default Deno executes the code in a sandbox, which means that runtime has no access to below areas:\n\n     1. The file system\n     2. The network\n     3. Execution of other scripts\n     4. The environment variables\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n413. ### How do you make an object iterable in javascript\n\n     By default, plain objects are not iterable. But you can make the object iterable by defining a `Symbol.iterator` property on it.\n\n     Let's demonstrate this with an example,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const collection = {\n       one: 1,\n       two: 2,\n       three: 3,\n       [Symbol.iterator]() {\n         const values = Object.keys(this);\n         let i = 0;\n         return {\n           next: () => {\n             return {\n               value: this[values[i++]],\n               done: i > values.length,\n             };\n           },\n         };\n       },\n     };\n\n     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();\n\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 1, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 2, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: 3, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // → {value: undefined, done: true}\n     ```\n\n     The above process can be simplified using a generator function,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const collection = {\n       one: 1,\n       two: 2,\n       three: 3,\n       [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {\n         for (let key in this) {\n           yield this[key];\n         }\n       },\n     };\n     const iterator = collection[Symbol.iterator]();\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 1, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 2, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: 3, done: false}\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n414. ### What is a Proper Tail Call\n\n     First, we should know about tail call before talking about \"Proper Tail Call\". A tail call is a subroutine or function call performed as the final action of a calling function. Whereas **Proper tail call(PTC)** is a technique where the program or code will not create additional stack frames for a recursion when the function call is a tail call.\n\n     For example, the below classic or head recursion of factorial function relies on stack for each step. Each step need to be processed upto `n * factorial(n - 1)`\n\n     ```javascript\n     function factorial(n) {\n       if (n === 0) {\n         return 1;\n       }\n       return n * factorial(n - 1);\n     }\n     console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n     ```\n\n     But if you use Tail recursion functions, they keep passing all the necessary data it needs down the recursion without relying on the stack.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function factorial(n, acc = 1) {\n       if (n === 0) {\n         return acc;\n       }\n       return factorial(n - 1, n * acc);\n     }\n     console.log(factorial(5)); //120\n     ```\n\n     The above pattern returns the same output as the first one. But the accumulator keeps track of total as an argument without using stack memory on recursive calls.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n415. ### How do you check an object is a promise or not\n\n     If you don't know if a value is a promise or not, wrapping the value as `Promise.resolve(value)` which returns a promise\n\n     ```javascript\n     function isPromise(object) {\n       if (Promise && Promise.resolve) {\n         return Promise.resolve(object) == object;\n       } else {\n         throw \"Promise not supported in your environment\";\n       }\n     }\n\n     var i = 1;\n     var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n       resolve();\n     });\n\n     console.log(isPromise(i)); // false\n     console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true\n     ```\n\n     Another way is to check for `.then()` handler type\n\n     ```javascript\n     function isPromise(value) {\n       return Boolean(value && typeof value.then === \"function\");\n     }\n     var i = 1;\n     var promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n       resolve();\n     });\n\n     console.log(isPromise(i)); // false\n     console.log(isPromise(promise)); // true\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n416. ### How to detect if a function is called as constructor\n\n     You can use `new.target` pseudo-property to detect whether a function was called as a constructor(using the new operator) or as a regular function call.\n\n     1. If a constructor or function invoked using the new operator, new.target returns a reference to the constructor or function.\n     2. For function calls, new.target is undefined.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function Myfunc() {\n       if (new.target) {\n         console.log(\"called with new\");\n       } else {\n         console.log(\"not called with new\");\n       }\n     }\n\n     new Myfunc(); // called with new\n     Myfunc(); // not called with new\n     Myfunc.call({}); // not called with new\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n417. ### What are the differences between arguments object and rest parameter\n\n     There are three main differences between arguments object and rest parameters\n\n     1. The arguments object is an array-like but not an array. Whereas the rest parameters are array instances.\n     2. The arguments object does not support methods such as sort, map, forEach, or pop. Whereas these methods can be used in rest parameters.\n     3. The rest parameters are only the ones that haven’t been given a separate name, while the arguments object contains all arguments passed to the function\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n418. ### What are the differences between spread operator and rest parameter\n\n     Rest parameter collects all remaining elements into an array. Whereas Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. i.e, Rest parameter is opposite to the spread operator.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n419. ### What are the different kinds of generators\n\n     There are five kinds of generators,\n\n     1. **Generator function declaration:**\n\n        ```javascript\n        function* myGenFunc() {\n          yield 1;\n          yield 2;\n          yield 3;\n        }\n        const genObj = myGenFunc();\n        ```\n\n     2. **Generator function expressions:**\n\n        ```javascript\n        const myGenFunc = function* () {\n          yield 1;\n          yield 2;\n          yield 3;\n        };\n        const genObj = myGenFunc();\n        ```\n\n     3. **Generator method definitions in object literals:**\n\n        ```javascript\n        const myObj = {\n          *myGeneratorMethod() {\n            yield 1;\n            yield 2;\n            yield 3;\n          },\n        };\n        const genObj = myObj.myGeneratorMethod();\n        ```\n\n     4. **Generator method definitions in class:**\n\n        ```javascript\n        class MyClass {\n          *myGeneratorMethod() {\n            yield 1;\n            yield 2;\n            yield 3;\n          }\n        }\n        const myObject = new MyClass();\n        const genObj = myObject.myGeneratorMethod();\n        ```\n\n     5. **Generator as a computed property:**\n\n        ```javascript\n        const SomeObj = {\n          *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n            yield 1;\n            yield 2;\n            yield 3;\n          },\n        };\n\n        console.log(Array.from(SomeObj)); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n        ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n420. ### What are the built-in iterables\n\n     Below are the list of built-in iterables in javascript,\n\n     1. Arrays and TypedArrays\n     2. Strings: Iterate over each character or Unicode code-points\n     3. Maps: iterate over its key-value pairs\n     4. Sets: iterates over their elements\n     5. arguments: An array-like special variable in functions\n     6. DOM collection such as NodeList\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n421. ### What are the differences between for...of and for...in statements\n\n     Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over js data structures. The only difference is over what they iterate:\n\n     1. for..in iterates over all enumerable property keys of an object\n     2. for..of iterates over the values of an iterable object.\n\n     Let's explain this difference with an example,\n\n     ```javascript\n     let arr = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\n\n     arr.newProp = \"newVlue\";\n\n     // key are the property keys\n     for (let key in arr) {\n       console.log(key); // 0, 1, 2 & newProp\n     }\n\n     // value are the property values\n     for (let value of arr) {\n       console.log(value); // a, b, c\n     }\n     ```\n\n     Since for..in loop iterates over the keys of the object, the first loop logs 0, 1, 2 and newProp while iterating over the array object. The for..of loop iterates over the values of a arr data structure and logs a, b, c in the console.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n422. ### How do you define instance and non-instance properties\n\n     The Instance properties must be defined inside of class methods. For example, name and age properties defined inside constructor as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     class Person {\n       constructor(name, age) {\n         this.name = name;\n         this.age = age;\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n     But Static(class) and prototype data properties must be defined outside of the ClassBody declaration. Let's assign the age value for Person class as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     Person.staticAge = 30;\n     Person.prototype.prototypeAge = 40;\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n423. ### What is the difference between isNaN and Number.isNaN?\n\n     1. **isNaN**: The global function `isNaN` converts the argument to a Number and returns true if the resulting value is NaN.\n     2. **Number.isNaN**: This method does not convert the argument. But it returns true when the type is a Number and value is NaN.\n\n     Let's see the difference with an example,\n\n     ```javascript\n     isNaN(‘hello’);   // true\n     Number.isNaN('hello'); // false\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n424. ### How to invoke an IIFE without any extra brackets?\n\n     Immediately Invoked Function Expressions(IIFE) requires a pair of parenthesis to wrap the function which contains set of statements.\n\n     ```js\n     (function (dt) {\n       console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString());\n     })(new Date());\n     ```\n\n     Since both IIFE and void operator discard the result of an expression, you can avoid the extra brackets using `void operator` for IIFE as below,\n\n     ```js\n     void (function (dt) {\n       console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString());\n     })(new Date());\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n425. ### Is that possible to use expressions in switch cases?\n\n     You might have seen expressions used in switch condition but it is also possible to use for switch cases by assigning true value for the switch condition. Let's see the weather condition based on temperature as an example,\n\n     ```js\n     const weather = (function getWeather(temp) {\n       switch (true) {\n         case temp < 0:\n           return \"freezing\";\n         case temp < 10:\n           return \"cold\";\n         case temp < 24:\n           return \"cool\";\n         default:\n           return \"unknown\";\n       }\n     })(10);\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n426. ### What is the easiest way to ignore promise errors?\n\n     The easiest and safest way to ignore promise errors is void that error. This approach is ESLint friendly too.\n\n     ```js\n     await promise.catch((e) => void e);\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n427. ### How do style the console output using CSS?\n\n     You can add CSS styling to the console output using the CSS format content specifier %c. The console string message can be appended after the specifier and CSS style in another argument. Let's print the red color text using console.log and CSS specifier as below,\n\n     ```js\n     console.log(\"%cThis is a red text\", \"color:red\");\n     ```\n\n     It is also possible to add more styles for the content. For example, the font-size can be modified for the above text\n\n     ```js\n     console.log(\n       \"%cThis is a red text with bigger font\",\n       \"color:red; font-size:20px\"\n     );\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n428. ### What is nullish coalescing operator (??)?\n\n     It is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. This can be contrasted with the logical OR (||) operator, which returns the right-hand side operand if the left operand is any falsy value, not only null or undefined.\n\n     ```js\n     console.log(null ?? true); // true\n     console.log(false ?? true); // false\n     console.log(undefined ?? true); // true\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n429. ### How do you group and nest console output?\n\n     The `console.group()` can be used to group related log messages to be able to easily read the logs and use console.groupEnd()to close the group. Along with this, you can also nest groups which allows to output message in hierarchical manner.\n\n     For example, if you’re logging a user’s details:\n\n     ```js\n     console.group(\"User Details\");\n     console.log(\"name: Sudheer Jonna\");\n     console.log(\"job: Software Developer\");\n\n     // Nested Group\n     console.group(\"Address\");\n     console.log(\"Street: Commonwealth\");\n     console.log(\"City: Los Angeles\");\n     console.log(\"State: California\");\n\n     // Close nested group\n     console.groupEnd();\n\n     // Close outer group\n     console.groupEnd();\n     ```\n\n     You can also use `console.groupCollapsed()` instead of `console.group()` if you want the groups to be collapsed by default.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n430. ### What is the difference between dense and sparse arrays?\n\n     An array contains items at each index starting from first(0) to last(array.length - 1) is called as Dense array. Whereas if at least one item is missing at any index, the array is called as sparse.\n\n     Let's see the below two kind of arrays,\n\n     ```js\n     const avengers = [\"Ironman\", \"Hulk\", \"CaptainAmerica\"];\n     console.log(avengers[0]); // 'Ironman'\n     console.log(avengers[1]); // 'Hulk'\n     console.log(avengers[2]); // 'CaptainAmerica'\n     console.log(avengers.length); // 3\n\n     const justiceLeague = [\"Superman\", \"Aquaman\", , \"Batman\"];\n     console.log(justiceLeague[0]); // 'Superman'\n     console.log(justiceLeague[1]); // 'Aquaman'\n     console.log(justiceLeague[2]); // undefined\n     console.log(justiceLeague[3]); // 'Batman'\n     console.log(justiceLeague.length); // 4\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n431. ### What are the different ways to create sparse arrays?\n\n     There are 4 different ways to create sparse arrays in JavaScript\n\n     1. **Array literal:** Omit a value when using the array literal\n        ```js\n        const justiceLeague = [\"Superman\", \"Aquaman\", , \"Batman\"];\n        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', empty ,'Batman']\n        ```\n     2. **Array() constructor:** Invoking Array(length) or new Array(length)\n        ```js\n        const array = Array(3);\n        console.log(array); // [empty, empty ,empty]\n        ```\n     3. **Delete operator:** Using delete array[index] operator on the array\n        ```js\n        const justiceLeague = [\"Superman\", \"Aquaman\", \"Batman\"];\n        delete justiceLeague[1];\n        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', empty, ,'Batman']\n        ```\n     4. **Increase length property:** Increasing length property of an array\n        ```js\n        const justiceLeague = [\"Superman\", \"Aquaman\", \"Batman\"];\n        justiceLeague.length = 5;\n        console.log(justiceLeague); // ['Superman', 'Aquaman', 'Batman', empty, empty]\n        ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n432. ### What is the difference between setTimeout, setImmediate and process.nextTick?\n\n     1. **Set Timeout:** setTimeout() is to schedule execution of a one-time callback after delay milliseconds.\n     2. **Set Immediate:** The setImmediate function is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes.\n     3. **Process NextTick:** If process.nextTick() is called in a given phase, all the callbacks passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event loop continues. This will block the event loop and create I/O Starvation if process.nextTick() is called recursively.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n433. ### How do you reverse an array without modifying original array?\n\n     The `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in an array but it mutates the original array. Let's take a simple example to demonistrate this case,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n     const newArray = originalArray.reverse();\n\n     console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n     console.log(originalArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n     ```\n\n     There are few solutions that won't mutate the original array. Let's take a look.\n\n     1. **Using slice and reverse methods:**\n        In this case, just invoke the `slice()` method on the array to create a shallow copy followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.slice().reverse(); //Slice an array gives a new copy\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     2. **Using spread and reverse methods:**\n        In this case, let's use the spread syntax (...) to create a copy of the array followed by `reverse()` method call on the copy.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = [...originalArray].reverse();\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     3. **Using reduce and spread methods:**\n        Here execute a reducer function on an array elements and append the accumulated array on right side using spread syntax\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduce((accumulator, value) => {\n          return [value, ...accumulator];\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     4. **Using reduceRight and spread methods:**\n        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and append the accumulated array on left side using spread syntax\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {\n          return [...accumulator, value];\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     5. **Using reduceRight and push methods:**\n        Here execute a right reducer function(i.e. opposite direction of reduce method) on an array elements and push the iterated value to the accumulator\n\n        ```javascript\n        const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n        const newArray = originalArray.reduceRight((accumulator, value) => {\n          accumulator.push(value);\n          return accumulator;\n        }, []);\n\n        console.log(originalArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n        console.log(newArray); // [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n434. ### How do you create custom HTML element?\n\n     The creation of custom HTML elements involves two main steps,\n\n     1. **Define your custom HTML element:** First you need to define some custom class by extending HTMLElement class.\n        After that define your component properties (styles,text etc) using `connectedCallback` method.\n        **Note:** The browser exposes a function called `customElements.define` inorder to reuse the element.\n        ```javascript\n        class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {\n          connectedCallback() {\n            this.innerHTML = \"This is a custom element\";\n          }\n        }\n        customElements.define(\"custom-element\", CustomElement);\n        ```\n     2. **Use custom element just like other HTML element:** Declare your custom element as a HTML tag.\n\n     ```javascript\n        <body>\n             <custom-element>\n        </body>\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n435. ### What is global execution context?\n\n     The global execution context is the default or first execution context that is created by the JavaScript engine before any code is executed(i.e, when the file first loads in the browser). All the global code that is not inside a function or object will be executed inside this global execution context. Since JS engine is single threaded there will be only one global environment and there will be only one global execution context.\n\n     For example, the below code other than code inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var x = 10;\n\n     function A() {\n       console.log(\"Start function A\");\n\n       function B() {\n         console.log(\"In function B\");\n       }\n\n       B();\n     }\n\n     A();\n\n     console.log(\"GlobalContext\");\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n436. ### What is function execution context?\n\n     Whenever a function is invoked, the JavaScript engine creates a different type of Execution Context known as a Function Execution Context (FEC) within the Global Execution Context (GEC) to evaluate and execute the code within that function.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n437. ### What is debouncing?\n\n    Debouncing is a programming technique used to limit how often a function is executed. Specifically, it ensures that a function is only triggered after a certain amount of time has passed since it was last invoked. This prevents unnecessary or excessive function calls, which can help optimize performance and reduce unnecessary CPU usage or API requests.\n\n    For example, when a user types in a search box, you typically want to wait until they’ve finished typing before fetching suggestions. Without debouncing, an API call would be triggered on every keystroke, potentially causing performance issues. With debouncing, the function call is postponed until the user stops typing for a specified period (e.g., 300ms). If the user types again before this time elapses, the timer resets.\n\n    **Typical use cases for debouncing include:**\n\n    *   Search box suggestions (wait until typing pauses before fetching results)\n    *   Auto-saving text fields (save only after the user stops typing)\n    *   Preventing double-clicks on buttons\n    *   Handling window resize or scroll events efficiently\n\n    **Example Debounce Function:**\n\n    JavaScript\n\n    ```css\n    function debounce(func, timeout = 500) {\n      let timer;\n      return function (...args) {\n        clearTimeout(timer);\n        timer = setTimeout(() => {\n          func.apply(this, args);\n        }, timeout);\n      };\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Usage Example:**\n\n    JavaScript\n\n    ```css\n    function fetchResults() {\n      console.log(\"Fetching input suggestions\");\n    }\n    const processChange = debounce(fetchResults, 300);\n\n    // Attach to input element\n    <input type=\"text\" onkeyup=\"processChange()\" />\n\n    // Attach to button\n    <button onclick=\"processChange()\">Click me</button>\n\n    // Attach to window event\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", processChange);\n    ```\n\n    **How it works:**  \n    When `processChange` is invoked (e.g., by typing or clicking), any pending execution is canceled, and the function is scheduled to run after the specified delay. If another event occurs before the delay is up, the timer resets, and the function will only run after events have stopped for the delay duration.\n\n    Debouncing is an essential tool for improving user experience and application performance, especially when dealing with events that can fire rapidly and repeatedly.\n\n **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n438. ### What is throttling?\n      Throttling is a programming technique used to control the rate at which a function is executed. When an event is triggered continuously—such as during window resizing, scrolling, or mouse movement—throttling ensures that the associated event handler is not called more often than a specified interval. This helps improve performance by reducing the number of expensive function calls and preventing performance bottlenecks.\n\n      **Common use cases:**\n\n      *   Window resize events\n      *   Scroll events\n      *   Mouse movement or drag events\n      *   API rate limiting\n\n      **How does throttling work?**  \n      Throttling will execute the function at most once every specified time interval, ignoring additional calls until the interval has passed.\n\n      **Example: Throttle Implementation and Usage**\n\n      JavaScript\n\n      ```css\n      // Simple throttle function: allows 'func' to run at most once every 'limit' ms\n      function throttle(func, limit) {\n        let inThrottle = false;\n        return function(...args) {\n          if (!inThrottle) {\n            func.apply(this, args);\n            inThrottle = true;\n            setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);\n          }\n        };\n      }\n\n      // Usage: throttling a scroll event handler\n      function handleScrollAnimation() {\n        console.log('Scroll event triggered');\n      }\n\n      window.addEventListener(\n        \"scroll\",\n        throttle(handleScrollAnimation, 100) // Will run at most once every 100ms\n      );\n      ```\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n439. ### What is optional chaining?\n\n     According to MDN official docs, the optional chaining operator (?.) permits reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.\n\n     The ?. operator is like the . chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (null or undefined), the expression short-circuits with a return value of undefined. When used with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does not exist.\n\n     ```js\n     const adventurer = {\n       name: \"Alice\",\n       cat: {\n         name: \"Dinah\",\n       },\n     };\n\n     const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;\n     console.log(dogName);\n     // expected output: undefined\n\n     console.log(adventurer.someNonExistentMethod?.());\n     // expected output: undefined\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n440. ### What is an environment record?\n\n     According to ECMAScript specification 262 (9.1):\n\n     > [Environment Record](https://262.ecma-international.org/12.0/#sec-environment-records) is a specification type used to define the association of Identifiers to specific variables and functions, based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code.\n\n     Usually an Environment Record is associated with some specific syntactic structure of ECMAScript code such as a FunctionDeclaration, a BlockStatement, or a Catch clause of a TryStatement.\n\n     Each time such code is evaluated, a new Environment Record is created to record the identifier bindings that are created by that code.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n441. ### How to verify if a variable is an array?\n\n     It is possible to check if a variable is an array instance using 3 different ways,\n\n     1. Array.isArray() method:\n\n        The `Array.isArray(value)` utility function is used to determine whether value is an array or not. This function returns a true boolean value if the variable is an array and a false value if it is not.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n        const user = { name: \"John\" };\n        Array.isArray(numbers); // true\n        Array.isArray(user); //false\n        ```\n\n     2. instanceof operator:\n\n        The instanceof operator is used to check the type of an array at run time. It returns true if the type of a variable is an Array other false for other type.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n        const user = { name: \"John\" };\n        console.log(numbers instanceof Array); // true\n        console.log(user instanceof Array); // false\n        ```\n\n     3. Checking constructor type:\n\n        The constructor property of the variable is used to determine whether the variable Array type or not.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n        const user = { name: \"John\" };\n        console.log(numbers.constructor === Array); // true\n        console.log(user.constructor === Array); // false\n        ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n442. ### What is pass by value and pass by reference?\n\n     Pass-by-value creates a new space in memory and makes a copy of a value. Primitives such as string, number, boolean etc will actually create a new copy. Hence, updating one value doesn't impact the other value. i.e, The values are independent of each other.\n\n     ```javascript\n     let a = 5;\n     let b = a;\n\n     b++;\n     console.log(a, b); //5, 6\n     ```\n\n     In the above code snippet, the value of `a` is assigned to `b` and the variable `b` has been incremented. Since there is a new space created for variable `b`, any update on this variable doesn't impact the variable `a`.\n\n     Pass by reference doesn't create a new space in memory but the new variable adopts a memory address of an initial variable. Non-primitives such as objects, arrays and functions gets the reference of the initiable variable. i.e, updating one value will impact the other variable.\n\n     ```javascript\n     let user1 = {\n       name: \"John\",\n       age: 27,\n     };\n     let user2 = user1;\n     user2.age = 30;\n\n     console.log(user1.age, user2.age); // 30, 30\n     ```\n\n     In the above code snippet, updating the `age` property of one object will impact the other property due to the same reference.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n443. ### What are the differences between primitives and non-primitives?\n\n     JavaScript language has both primitives and non-primitives but there are few differences between them as below,\n\n     | Primitives                 | Non-primitives       |\n     | -------------------------- | -------------------- |\n     | These types are predefined | Created by developer |\n     | These are immutable        | Mutable              |\n     | Compare by value           | Compare by reference |\n     | Stored in Stack            | Stored in heap       |\n     | Contain certain value      | Can contain NULL too |\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n444. ### How do you create your own bind method using either call or apply method?\n\n     The custom bind function needs to be created on Function prototype inorder to use it as other builtin functions. This custom function should return a function similar to original bind method and the implementation of inner function needs to use apply method call.\n\n     The function which is going to bind using custom `myOwnBind` method act as the attached function(`boundTargetFunction`) and argument as the object for `apply` method call.\n\n     ```js\n     Function.prototype.myOwnBind = function (whoIsCallingMe) {\n       if (typeof this !== \"function\") {\n         throw new Error(this + \"cannot be bound as it's not callable\");\n       }\n       const boundTargetFunction = this;\n       return function () {\n         boundTargetFunction.apply(whoIsCallingMe, arguments);\n       };\n     };\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n445. ### What are the differences between pure and impure functions?\n\n     Some of the major differences between pure and impure function are as below,\n\n| Pure function                       | Impure function                                                        |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| It has no side effects              | It causes side effects                                                 |\n| It is always return the same result | It returns different result on each call                               |\n| Easy to read and debug              | Difficult to read and debug because they are affected by external code |\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n446. ### What is referential transparency?\n\nAn expression in javascript that can be replaced by its value without affecting the behaviour of the program is called referential transparency. Pure functions are referentially transparent.\n\n```javascript\nconst add = (x, y) => x + y;\nconst multiplyBy2 = (x) => x * 2;\n\n//Now add (2, 3) can be replaced by 5.\n\nmultiplyBy2(add(2, 3));\n```\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n447. ### What are the possible side-effects in javascript?\n\n     A side effect is the modification of the state through the invocation of a function or expression. These side effects make our function impure by default. Below are some side effects which make function impure,\n\n- Making an HTTP request. Asynchronous functions such as fetch and promise are impure.\n- DOM manipulations\n- Mutating the input data\n- Printing to a screen or console: For example, console.log() and alert()\n- Fetching the current time\n- Math.random() calls: Modifies the internal state of Math object\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n448. ### What are compose and pipe functions?\n\n     The \"compose\" and \"pipe\" are two techniques commonly used in functional programming to simplify complex operations and make code more readable. They are not native to JavaScript and higher-order functions. the `compose()` applies right to left any number of functions to the output of the previous function.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n449. ### What is module pattern?\n\n     Module pattern is a designed pattern used to wrap a set of variables and functions together in a single scope returned as an object. JavaScript doesn't have access specifiers similar to other languages(Java, Python, etc) to provide private scope. It uses IIFE (Immediately invoked function expression) to allow for private scopes. i.e., a closure that protect variables and methods.\n\n     The module pattern looks like below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     (function () {\n       // Private variables or functions goes here.\n\n       return {\n         // Return public variables or functions here.\n       };\n     })();\n     ```\n\n     Let's see an example of a module pattern for an employee with private and public access,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const createEmployee = (function () {\n       // Private\n       const name = \"John\";\n       const department = \"Sales\";\n       const getEmployeeName = () => name;\n       const getDepartmentName = () => department;\n\n       // Public\n       return {\n         name,\n         department,\n         getName: () => getEmployeeName(),\n         getDepartment: () => getDepartmentName(),\n       };\n     })();\n\n     console.log(createEmployee.name);\n     console.log(createEmployee.department);\n     console.log(createEmployee.getName());\n     console.log(createEmployee.getDepartment());\n     ```\n\n     **Note:** It mimic the concepts of classes with private variables and methods.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n450. ### What is Function Composition?\n\n     It is an approach where the result of one function is passed on to the next function, which is passed to another until the final function is executed for the final result.\n\n     ```javascript\n     //example\n     const double = (x) => x * 2;\n     const square = (x) => x * x;\n\n     var output1 = double(2);\n     var output2 = square(output1);\n     console.log(output2);\n\n     var output_final = square(double(2));\n     console.log(output_final);\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n451. ### How to use await outside of async function prior to ES2022?\n\n     Prior to ES2022, if you attempted to use an await outside of an async function resulted in a SyntaxError.\n\n     ```javascript\n     await Promise.resolve(console.log(\"Hello await\")); // SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function\n     ```\n\n     But you can fix this issue with an alternative IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to get access to the feature.\n\n     ```javascript\n     (async function () {\n       await Promise.resolve(console.log(\"Hello await\")); // Hello await\n     })();\n     ```\n\n     In ES2022, you can write top-level await without writing any hacks.\n\n     ```javascript\n     await Promise.resolve(console.log(\"Hello await\")); //Hello await\n     ```\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n452. ### What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?\nThe `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to **the object that is executing the current function**. Its value is determined by **how a function is called**, not where it is defined.  `this` is essential for writing object-oriented and event-driven code, as it allows methods to interact with the data of the object they belong to.\n\n\n  **Example 1: this in a Global Context**\n\n  ```javascript\n  console.log(this);\n  ```\n\n  - In a global context, this refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser).\n\n  **Example 2: this in a Function**\n\n  ```javascript\n  function displayThis() {\n    console.log(this);\n  }\n\n  displayThis();\n  ```\n\n  - In a regular function, this refers to the global object(window in browser and global in nodejs) for non-strict mode.  In strict mode, it's value is undefined.\n\n  **Example 3: this in a Method**\n\n  ```javascript\n  const person = {\n    name: \"John\",\n    greet: function () {\n      console.log(\"Hello, \" + this.name);\n    },\n  };\n\n  person.greet();\n  ```\n\n  - In a method, this refers to the object that owns the method (person in the case).\n\n  **Example 4: this in an Event Handler**\n\n  ```javascript\n   document.getElementById(\"myButton\").addEventListener(\"click\", function () {\n            console.log(this);\n   });\n  ```\n\n  - In an event handler, this refers to the element that triggered the event (the button in this case).\n\n  **Example 5: `this` with Arrow Functions**\n\n  ```javascript\n        const obj = {\n          age: 42,\n          regular: function() { console.log(this.age); },\n          arrow: () => { console.log(this.age); }\n        };\n        obj.regular(); // 42 (this refers to obj)\n        obj.arrow();   // undefined (this refers to the outer scope, not obj)\n  ```\n  - Arrow functions do not have their own `this` binding; they inherit it from their surrounding (lexical) context.\n\n  **Example 6: this in Constructor Functions / Classes**\n    \n  ```javascript\n    function Person(name) {\n      this.name = name;\n    }\n    \n    const p1 = new Person('Sudheer');\n    console.log(p1.name); // Sudheer\n  ```\n   - When used with new, this refers to the newly created object.\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n453. ### What are the uses of closures?\n     Closures are a powerful feature in programming languages like JavaScript. They allow functions to retain access to variables from their containing (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This means that a function defined within another function can access variables from the outer function, even if the outer function has already returned.\n     Here are some common use cases of closures:\n\n- Data Privacy: Closures can be used to create private variables and methods. By defining variables within a function's scope and returning inner functions that have access to those variables, you can create a form of encapsulation, limiting access to certain data or functionality.\n\n- Function Factories: Closures are often used to create functions with pre-set parameters. This is useful when you need to create multiple functions with similar behavior but different configurations.\n\n- Callback Functions: Closures are frequently used in asynchronous programming, such as handling event listeners or AJAX requests. The inner function captures variables from the outer scope and can access them when the callback is invoked.\n\n- Memoization: Closures can be used for memoization, a technique to optimize performance by caching the results of expensive function calls. The inner function can remember the results of previous calls and return the cached result if the same input is provided again.\n\n- iterators and Generators: Closures can be used to create iterators and generators, which are essential for working with collections of data in modern JavaScript.\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n454. ### What are the phases of execution context?\n     The execution context in JavaScript is a data structure that stores the information necessary for executing a piece of code. It includes the code itself, the values of the variables used in the code, and the scope chain. The scope chain is a list of objects that are used to resolve variable names.\n\nThe execution context has two phases:\n\n- Creation phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine creates the execution context and sets up the script's environment. This includes creating the variable object and the scope chain.\n- Execution phase: In this phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code in the execution context. This includes evaluating expressions, assigning values to variables, and calling functions.\n\nThe execution context is created when a function is called. The function's code is then executed in the execution context. When the function returns, the execution context is destroyed.\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n455. ### What are the possible reasons for memory leaks?\n\n     Memory leaks can lead to poor performance, slow loading times and even crashes in web applications. Some of the common causes of memory leaks are listed below,\n\n     1. The execessive usage of global variables or omitting the `var` keyword in local scope.\n     2. Forgetting to clear the timers set up by `setTimeout` or `setInterval`.\n     3. Closures retain references to variables from their parent scope, which leads to variables might not garbage collected even they are no longer used.\n\n456. ### What are the optimization techniques of V8 engine?\n\n     V8 engine uses the below optimization techniques.\n\n     1. **Inline expansion:** It is a compiler optimization by replacing the function calls with the corresponding function blocks.\n     2. **Copy elision:** This is a compiler optimization method to prevent expensive extra objects from being duplicated or copied.\n     3. **Inline caching:** It is a runtime optimization technique where it caches the execution of older tasks those can be lookup while executing the same task in the future.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n457. ### What are the examples of built-in higher order functions?\n\n     There are several built-in higher order functions exists on arrays, strings, DOM and promise methods in javascript. These higher order functions provides significant level of abstraction. The list of functions on these categories are listed below,\n\n     1. **arrays:** map, filter, reduce, sort, forEach, some etc.\n     2. **DOM**: The DOM method `element.addEventListener(type, handler)` also accepts the function handler as a second argument.\n     3. **Strings:** replace() method.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n458. ### What are the benefits higher order functions?\n     The main benefits of higher order functions are:\n     1. Abstraction\n     2. Reusability\n     3. Immutability\n     4. Modularity\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n459. ### How do you create polyfills for map, filter and reduce methods?\n\nThe polyfills for array methods such as map, filter and reduce methods can be created using array prototype.\n\n1.  **map:**\n\n    The built-in `Array.map` method syntax will be helpful to write polyfill. The map method takes the callback function as an argument and that callback function can have below three arguments passed into it.\n\n    i. Current value\n    ii. Index of current value(optional)\n    iii. array(optional)\n\n    The syntax would like below,\n\n    ```js\n    let newArray = arr.map(callback(currentValue[, index, arr) {\n       // return new array after executing the code\n    })\n    ```\n\n    Let's build our map polyfill based on the above syntax,\n\n    ```js\n    Array.prototype.myMap = function (cb) {\n      let newArr = [];\n      for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {\n        newArr.push(cb(this[i], i, this));\n      }\n      return newArr;\n    };\n\n    const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    const multiplyByTwo = nums.myMap((x) => x * 2);\n    console.log(multiplyByTwo); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n    ```\n\n    In the above code, custom method name 'myMap' has been used to avoid conflicts with built-in method.\n\n2.  **filter:**\n    Similar to map method, `Array.filter` method takes callback function as an argument and the callback function can have three agurguments passed into it.\n\n        i. Current value\n        ii. Index of current value(optional)\n        iii. array(optional)\n\n    The syntax looks like below,\n\n    ```js\n    let newArray = arr.filter(callback(currentValue[, index, arr) {\n      // return new array whose elements satisfy the callback conditions\n    })\n    ```\n\n    Let's build our filter polyfill based on the above syntax,\n\n    ```js\n    Array.prototype.myFilter = function (cb) {\n      let newArr = [];\n      for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {\n        if (cb(this[i], i, this)) {\n          newArr.push(this[i]);\n        }\n      }\n      return newArr;\n    };\n\n    const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n    const evenNums = nums.myFilter((x) => x % 2);\n    console.log(evenNums); // [2, 4, 6]\n    ```\n\n3.  **reduce:**\n\n          The built-in `Array.reduce` method syntax will be helpful to write our own polyfill. The reduce method takes the callback function as first argument and the initial value as second argument.\n\n          The callback function can have four arguments passed into it.\n          i. Accumulator\n          ii. Current value\n          iii. Index of current value(optional)\n          iv. array(optional)\n\n        The syntax would like below,\n\n        ```js\n        arr.reduce(callback((acc, curr, i, arr) => {}), initValue);\n        ```\n        Let's build our reduce polyfill based on the above syntax,\n\n        ```js\n        Array.prototype.myReduce = function(cb, initialValue) {\n            let accumulator = initialValue;\n            for(let i=0; i< this.length; i++) {\n                accumulator = accumulator ? cb(accumulator, this[i], i, this) : this[i];\n            }\n            return accumulator;\n        }\n          const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];\n          const sum = nums.myReduce((acc, curr, i, arr) => {\n            return acc += curr\n          }, 0);\n          console.log(sum); // 21\n        ```\n\n    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n460. ### What is the difference between map and forEach functions?\n\n    Both map and forEach functions are used to iterate over an arrays but there are some differences in their functionality.\n\n    1. **Returning values:** The `map` method returns a new array with transformed elements whereas `forEach` method returns `undefined` eventhough both of them are doing the same job.\n\n    ```javascript\n      const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n      arr.map(x => x * x); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n      arr.forEach(x => x * x); //\n\n      The `forEach()` method in JavaScript always returns undefined. This is because forEach() is used to iterate over arrays and perform side effects on each element, rather than returning a `new array or transforming the original array`\n    ```\n\n    2. **Chaining methods:** The `map` method is chainable. i.e, It can be attached with `reduce`, `filter`, `sort` and other methods as well. Whereas `forEach` cannot be attached with any other methods because it returns `undefined` value.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n    arr.map((x) => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); // 55\n    arr.forEach((x) => x * x).reduce((total, cur) => total + cur); //Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefine(reading 'reduce')\n    ```\n\n    3. **Mutation:** The `map` method doesn't mutate the original array by returning new array. Whereas `forEach` method also doesn't mutate the original array but it's callback is allowed to mutate the original array.\n\n    **Note:** Both these methods existed since ES5 onwards.\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n461. ### Give an example of statements affected by automatic semicolon insertion?\n\n     The javascript parser will automatically add a semicolon while parsing the source code. For example, the below common statements affected by Automatic Semicolon Insertion(ASI).\n\n     1. An empty statement\n     2. var statement\n     3. An expression statement\n     4. do-while statement\n     5. continue statement\n     6. break statement\n     7. return statement\n     8. throw statement\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n462. ### What are the event phases of a browser?\n\n     There are 3 phases in the lifecycle of an event propagation in JavaScript,\n\n     1. **Capturing phase:** This phase goes down gradually from the top of the DOM tree to the target element when a nested element clicked. Before the click event reaching the final destination element, the click event of each parent's element must be triggered.\n\n     2. **Target phase:** This is the phase where the event originally occurred reached the target element .\n\n     3. **Bubbling phase:** This is reverse of the capturing phase. In this pase, the event bubbles up from the target element through it's parent element, an ancestor and goes all the way to the global window object.\n\n     The pictorial representation of these 3 event phases in DOM looks like below,\n\n     ![Screenshot](images/event-flow.png)\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n463. ### What are the real world use cases of proxy?\n\n     Proxies are not used in regular day to day JavaScript work but they enabled many exciting programming patterns. Some of the real world use cases are listed below,\n\n     1. Vue3 used proxy concept to implement reactive state\n     2. SolidJS implemented reactive stores\n     3. Immerjs built upon proxy to track updates to immutable updates\n     4. ZenStack improved Prisma ORM for access control layer\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n464. ### What are hidden classes?\n\n     Since JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, you can add or remove properties and methods from objects on the fly at runtime. This nature of JavaScript increases the dynamic dictionary lookups(because objects implemented as HashTables in memory) for retrieving a property on an object.\n\n     Let's consider the following example to see how the additional properties `age` and `gender` added at runtime.\n\n     ```javascript\n     function Person(name) {\n       this.name = name;\n     }\n\n     var person1 = new Person(\"John\");\n     var person2 = new Person(\"Randy\");\n\n     person1.age = 40;\n     person1.gender = \"Male\";\n\n     person2.gender = \"Female\";\n     person2.age = 50;\n     ```\n\n     As a result, this behavior leads to lower JavaScript performance compared to the contiguous buffer method used in non-dynamic languages. The V8 engine provided a solution named **hidden classes** to optimize the access time when retrieving a property on an object. This optimization is achieved by sharing hidden classes among objects created in a similar fashion. These hidden classes are attached to each and every object to track its shape.\n\n     When V8 engine sees the constructor function(e.g, Person) is declared, it creates a hidden class (let's say Class01) without any offsets. Once the first property assignment statement (`this.name = name`) is executed, V8 engine will create a new hidden class (let's say Class02), inheriting all properties from the previous hidden class (Class01), and assign the property to offset 0. This process enables compiler to skip dictionary lookup when you try to retrieve the same property(i.e, name). Instead, V8 will directly point to Class02. The same procedure happens when you add new properties to the object.\n\n     For example, adding `age` and `gender` properties to `Person` constructor leads to transition of hidden classes(Class02 -> Class03 -> Class04). If you create a second object(Person2) based on the same Person object, both Class01 and Class02 hidden classes are going to be shared. However, the hidden classes Class03 and Class04 cannot be shared because second object has been modified with a different order of properties assignment.\n\n     Since both the objects(person1 and person2) do not share the hidden classes, now V8 engine cannot use **Inline Caching** technique for the faster access of properties.\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n465. ### What is inline caching?\n\nInline caching is an optimization technique based on the observation that repeated calls to same function tends to occur on same type of objects. The V8 compiler stores a cache of the type of objects that were passed as a parameter in recent method calls. Upon next time when same function is called, compiler can directly search for the type in cache.\n\nLet's consider an example where the compiler stores the shape type in cache for repeated calls in the loop.\n\n```js\nlet shape = { width: 30, height: 20 }; // Compiler store the type in cache as { width: <int>, height: <int>} after repeated calls\n\nfunction area(obj) {\n  //Calculate area\n}\nfor (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n  area(shape);\n}\n```\n\nAfter few successful calls of the same area method to its same hidden class, V8 engine omits the hidden class lookup and simply adds the offset of the property to the object pointer itself. As a result, it increases the execution speed.\n\nThere are mainly 3 types of inline caching possible:\n\n1. Monomorphic: This is a optimized caching technique in which there can be always same type of objects passed.\n2. Polymorphic: This ia slightly optimized caching technique in which limited number of different types of objects can be passed.\n3. Megamorphic: It is an unoptimized caching in which any number of different objects can be passed.\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n466. ### What are the different ways to execute external scripts?\n\n     There are three different ways to execute external scripts,\n\n     1. async: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is available even before parsing completes. The parsing of the page is going to be interuppted once the script is downloaded completely and then the script is executed. Thereafter, the parsing of the remaining page will continue.\n\n        The syntax for async usage is as shown below,\n\n        ```html\n        <script src=\"demo.js\" async></script>\n        ```\n\n     2. defer: The script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed after the page has finished parsing.\n\n        The syntax for defer usage is as shown below,\n\n        ```html\n        <script src=\"demo.js\" defer></script>\n        ```\n\n     3. Neither async or defer: The script is downloaded and executed immediately by blocking parsing of the page until the script execution is completed.\n\n     **Note:** You should only use either async or defer attribute if the `src` attribute is present.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n467. ### What is Lexical Scope?\n\n     Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.\n\n     ```js\n     <script>\n             function x(){\n               var a=10;\n               function y(){\n                   console.log(a); // will print a , because of lexical scope, it will first look 'a' in\n               //its local memory space and then in its parent functions memory space\n               }\n               y();\n           }\n           x();\n     </script>\n     ```\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n468. ### How to detect system dark mode in javascript?\n\n     The combination of `Window.matchMedia()` utility method along with media query is used to check if the user has selected a dark color scheme in their operating system settings or not. The CSS media query `prefers-color-scheme` needs to be passed to identify system color theme.\n\n     The following javascript code describes the usage,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const hasDarkColorScheme = () =>\n       window.matchMedia &&\n       window.matchMedia(\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\").matches;\n     ```\n\n     You can also watch changes to system color scheme using `addEventListener`,\n\n     ```javascript\n     window\n       .matchMedia(\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\")\n       .addEventListener(\"change\", (event) => {\n         const theme = event.matches ? \"dark\" : \"light\";\n       });\n     ```\n\n     **Note:** The matchMedia method returns **MediaQueryList** object stores information from a media query.\n\n     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n469. ### What is the purpose of requestAnimationFrame method?\n     The requestAnimationFrame() method in JavaScript is used to schedule a function to be called before the next repaint of the browser window, allowing you to create smooth, efficient animations. It's primarily used for animations and visual updates, making it an essential tool for improving performance when you're animating elements on the web.\n\n```javascript\nconst element = document.getElementById(\"myElement\");\nfunction animate() {\n  let currentPosition = parseInt(window.getComputedStyle(element).left, 10);\n\n  // Move the element 2px per frame\n  currentPosition += 2;\n  element.style.left = currentPosition + \"px\";\n  // If the element hasn't moved off-screen, request the next frame\n  if (currentPosition < window.innerWidth) {\n    requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n  }\n}\n// Start the animation\nrequestAnimationFrame(animate);\n```\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n470. ### What is the difference between substring and substr methods?\n\n     Both `substring` and `substr` are used to extract parts of a string, but there are subtle differences between the substring() and substr() methods in terms of **syntax** and **behavior**.\n\n     1. `substring(start, end)`\n         - **Parameters:**\n             - `start`: The index to start extracting (inclusive).\n             - `end`: The index to stop extracting (exclusive).\n         - **Behavior:**\n             - If `start > end`, it **swaps the arguments**.\n             - Negative values are treated as `0`.\n\n         ```javascript\n          let str = \"Hello World\";\n          console.log(str.substring(0, 5));   // \"Hello\"\n          console.log(str.substring(5, 0));   // \"Hello\" (swapped)\n          console.log(str.substring(-3, 4));  // \"Hell\" (negative = 0)\n         ```\n     2. `substr(start, length)` _(Deprecated)_\n\n         - **Parameters:**\n           - `start`: The index to start extracting.\n           - `length`: The number of characters to extract.\n         - **Behavior:**\n           - If `start` is negative, it counts from the **end** of the string.\n           - If `length` is omitted, it extracts to the end of the string.\n\n         ```javascript\n         let str = \"Hello World\"; console.log(str.substr(0, 5)); // \"Hello\" \n         console.log(str.substr(-5, 3)); // \"Wor\" (starts from 'W')`\n         ```\n         **Note:** substr() is considered a legacy feature in ECMAScript, so it is best to avoid using it if possible.\n\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n471. ### How to find the number of parameters expected by a function?\n     The function's object has a **length** property which tells you how many formal parameters expected by a function. This is a static value defined by the function, not the number of arguments the function is called with(**arguments.length**). The basic usage of length propery is,\n\n```javascript\nfunction multiply(x, y) {\n  return x * y;\n}\n\nfunction sum(a, b, c) {\n  return a + b + c;\n}\n\nconsole.log(multiply.length); //2\nconsole.log(sum.length); //3\n```\n\nBut there are few important rules which needs to be noted while using length property.\n\n1. **Default values:** Only the parameters which exists before a default value are considered.\n   ```javascript\n   function sum(a, b = 2, c = 3) {\n     return a + b + c;\n   }\n   console.log(sum.length); // 1\n   ```\n2. **Rest params:** The rest parameters are excluded with in length property.\n   ```javascript\n   function sum(a, b, ...moreArgs) {\n     let total = a + b;\n     for (const arg of moreArgs) {\n       total += arg;\n     }\n     return total;\n   }\n   console.log(sum.length); // 2\n   ```\n3. **Destructuring patterns:** Each destructuring pattern counted as a single parameter.\n\n   ```javascript\n   function func([a, b], { x, y }) {\n     console.log(a + b, x, y);\n   }\n\n   console.log(func.length); // 2\n   ```\n\n**Note:** The Function constructor is itself a function object and it has a length property of 1.\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n472. ### What is globalThis, and what is the importance of it?\n\n     Nowadays JavaScript language is used in a wide variety of environments and each environment has its own object model. Due to this fact, there are different ways(syntax) to access the global object.\n\n     1. In web browser, the global object is accessible via `window`, `self`, or `frames`.\n     2. In Node environment, you have to use `global`.\n     3. In Web workers, the global object is available through `self`.\n\nThe `globalThis` property provides a standard way of accessing the global object without writing various code snippet to support multiple environments. For example, the global object retuned from multiple environments as shown below,\n\n```javascript\n//1. browser environment\nconsole.log(globalThis); // => Window {...}\n\n//2. node.js environment\nconsole.log(globalThis); // => Object [global] {...}\n\n//3. web worker environment\nconsole.log(globalThis); // => DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope {...}\n```\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n473. ### What are the array mutation methods?\n     JavaScript array methods can be categorized into two groups:\n1. Mutating methods: These are the methods that directly modify the original array.\n1. Non-mutating methods: These methods return a new array without altering the original one.\n\nThere are 9 methods in total that mutate the arrays,\n\n1.  **push:** Adds one or more elements to the end of the array and returns the new length.\n2.  **pop:** Removes the last element from the array and returns that element.\n3.  **unshift:** Adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array and returns the new length..\n4.  **shift:** Removes the first element from the array and returns that element.\n5.  **splice:** Adds or removes elements from the array at a specific index position.\n6.  **sort:** Sorts the elements of the array in-place based on a given sorting criteria.\n7.  **reverse:** Reverses the order of elements in the given array.\n8.  **fill:** Fills all elements of the array with a specific value.\n9.  **copyWithIn:** Copies a sequence of elements within the array to a specified target index in the same array.\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n474. ### What is module scope in JavaScript?\n     Module scope is a feature introduced with ES6 (ES2015) modules that creates a scope specific to a module file, isolating variables and functions declared within it from the global scope and other modules. Variables and functions declared in a module are private by default and can only be accessed by other modules if they are explicitly exported.\n\nKey characteristics of module scope:\n\n1.  Variables declared in a module are scoped to that module only.\n2.  Each module has its own top-level scope\n3.  Variables and functions need to be explicitly exported to be used in other modules\n4.  The global scope cannot access module variables unless they are explicitly exported and imported\n5.  Modules are always executed in strict mode\n\n```javascript\n// moduleA.js\n\n// This variable is PRIVATE to moduleA. It's like a tool inside a closed box.\nconst privateVariable = \"I am private\";\n\n// This variable is PUBLIC because it's exported. Others can use it when they import moduleA.\nexport const publicVariable = \"I am public\";\n\n// PUBLIC function because it's exported.

The inner variable shadows the outer one — meaning, the inner variable takes precedence in its own scope.\n\n     Let's take an example where the inner `a` inside `func()` shadows the outer variable `a`.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let a = 10;\n\n      function func() {\n        let a = 20; // Shadows the outer 'a'\n        console.log(a); // 20\n      }\n\n      func();\n      console.log(a); // 10\n      ```\n\n     **Illegal shadowing** in JavaScript refers to a syntax error that happens when you try to declare a block-scoped variable (`let` or `const`) with the same name as a variable declared using `var` in the same or an overlapping scope. \n\n     For example, if you declare both block-scoped variable and function scoped variable using the same name inside a function causes an illegal shadowing.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function test() {\n        var a = 10;\n        let a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared\n      }\n      ```\n    \n      As an another example, if you declare a variable with `let` or `const` in an outer scope, and then try to redeclare it with `var` inside a nested block, JavaScript throws an error — even though `var` is supposed to be function-scoped. Since the var appears in a block, it ends up trying to overwrite the `let` in the outer scope, which causes a conflict.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let a = 10;\n      {\n        var a = 20; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared\n        console.log(a);\n      }\n      ```\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n476. ### Why is it important to remove event listeners after use?\n     \n  In JavaScript, you need to be mindful of removing event listeners to avoid memory leaks — especially in long-lived apps like single-page applications (SPAs) or when working with frameworks/libraries. Eventhough JavaScript has automatic garbage collection, memory leaks can still happen if:\n\n  1. A DOM element is removed, but a listener still references it.\n  2. A callback (event listener) holds a reference to a large object or closure that can't be cleaned up.\n  3. Global objects like window, document etc retain listeners indefinitely unless manually removed.\n\n  So if you add any event listeners to DOM element, it is a good practice to remove it after its usage as shown below,\n\n  ```javascript\n     const button = document.getElementById(\"btn\");\n\n      function handleClick() {\n        console.log(\"Clicked!\");\n      }\n\n      button.addEventListener(\"click\", handleClick);\n\n      // Always remove when done\n      button.removeEventListener(\"click\", handleClick);\n  ```\n\n  **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n477. ### What is structuredClone and how is it used for deep copying objects?\n\n      In JavaScript, `structuredClone()` is a built-in method used to create a **deep copy** of a value. It safely clones nested objects, arrays, Maps, Sets, Dates, TypedArrays, and even circular references — without sharing references to the original value. This prevents accidental mutations and makes it useful for state management and data processing.\n\n       For example, the below snippet demonstrates deep cloning of a nested object,\n\n        ```javascript\n           const originalObject = {\n             name: \"Deep Copy Test\",\n             nested: {\n            value: 10,\n            list: [1, 2, 3]\n  },\n};\n\n    const deepCopy = structuredClone(originalObject);\n\n    // Modify cloned value\n    deepCopy.nested.value = 99;\n    deepCopy.nested.list.push(4);\n    console.log(originalObject.nested.value); // 10\n    console.log(deepCopy.nested.value);       // 99\n    console.log(originalObject.nested.list);  // [1, 2, 3]\n    console.log(deepCopy.nested.list);        // [1, 2, 3, 4]\n   \n   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n478. ### What is the difference between const and Object.freeze\n\n     The main difference is that `const` applies to **variables** (bindings), while `Object.freeze()` applies to **values** (objects).\n\n     1. **`const`**: Prevents the reassignment of a variable identifier. It ensures that the variable name always points to the same memory reference. However, if the variable holds an object or array, the *contents* of that object can still be modified.\n     2. **`Object.freeze()`**: Prevents the modification of an object's properties. It makes the object immutable (you cannot add, remove, or change properties), but it does not affect the variable assignment itself (unless the variable is also declared with `const`).\n\n     **Example:**\n\n     ```javascript\n       // Case 1: Using const (Reassignment prevented, Mutation allowed)\n       const person = { name: \"John\" };\n       person.name = \"Doe\"; // ✅ Allowed: The object is mutable\n       console.log(person.name); // \"Doe\"\n\n       // person = { name: \"Jane\" }; // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable\n\n       // Case 2: Using Object.freeze (Reassignment allowed, Mutation prevented)\n       let profile = { name: \"John\" };\n       Object.freeze(profile);\n\n       profile.name = \"Doe\"; // ❌ Ignored (or throws TypeError in strict mode)\n       console.log(profile.name); // \"John\"\n\n       profile = { name: \"Jane\" }; // ✅ Allowed: 'profile' is declared with 'let'\n       console.log(profile.name); // \"Jane\"\n       \n\n      **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n\n<!-- QUESTIONS_END -->\n### Coding Exercise\n\n#### 1.

This statement is equivalent to,\n\n```javascript\nlet x;\nwindow.y = 0;\nx = window.y;\n```\n\nSince the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too.

Then the browser pushes the first statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately.\n3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.\n4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.\n5. The callback of `setTimeout` moved from Browser API to message queue.\n6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute\n7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.\n8.

But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,\n\n```javascript\nfunction func() {\n  return Promise.resolve(10);\n}\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 26.

In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of `undefined` is returned as the resolution of the promise.

The ! operator operates on either `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString`, converting them to boolean values. Since the value of both `!typeof myNumber` and `!typeof myString` is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.\n\nTo make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:\n\n```\nif (!(typeof myNumber === \"string\"))\n```\n\nOr simply use the inequality operator:\n\n```\nif (typeof myNumber !== \"string\")\n```\n\n</p>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 33.

In other words, it doesn't matter where `this` has been written but how it has been invoked really matter. In the above code snippet, the `user` object invokes `eat` function so `this` keyword refers to `user` object but `eatFruit` has been invoked by `eat` function and `this` will have default `Window` object.\n\nThe above pit fall fixed by three ways,\n\n1. In ES6, the arrow function will make `this` keyword as lexically scoped. Since the surrounding object of `this` object is `user` object, the `eatFruit` function will contain `user` object for `this` object.\n\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var eatFruit = () => {\n      console.log(this);\n    };\n    eatFruit();\n  },\n};\nuser.eat();\n```\n\nThe next two solutions have been used before ES6 introduced.\n\n2.  It is possible create a reference of `this` into a separate variable and use that new variable inplace of `this` keyword inside `eatFruit` function. This is a common practice in jQuery and AngularJS before ES6 introduced.\n\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var self = this;\n    var eatFruit = () => {\n      console.log(self);\n    };\n    eatFruit();\n  },\n};\nuser.eat();\n```\n\n3. The `eatFruit` function can bind explicitly with `this` keyword where it refers `Window` object.\n\n```javascript\nconst user = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  eat() {\n    console.log(this);\n    var eatFruit = function () {\n      console.log(this);\n    };\n    return eatFruit.bind(this);\n  },\n};\nuser.eat()();\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 72.

This is because the try...catch statement works synchronously, and the function in the above code is executed asynchronously after a certain period of time. Hence, you will see runtime exception without catching the error. To resolve this issue, you have to put the try...catch block inside the function as below,\n\n```javascript\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  try {\n    console.log(\"try block\");\n    throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`);\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.log(\"Error: \", err);\n  }\n}, 1000);\n```\n\nYou can use `.catch()` function in promises to avoid these issues with asynchronous code.\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 79. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nlet a = 10;\nif (true) {\n  let a = 20;\n  console.log(a, \"inside\");\n}\nconsole.log(a, \"outside\");\n```\n\n- 1: 20, \"inside\" and 20, \"outside\"\n- 2: 20, \"inside\" and 10, \"outside\"\n- 3: 10, \"inside\" and 10, \"outside\"\n- 4: 10, \"inside\" and 20, \"outside\"\n\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n\n##### Answer: 2\n\nThe variable \"a\" declared inside \"if\" has block scope and does not affect the value of the outer \"a\" variable.\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 80.

How do you verify two strings are anagrams or not?\n\nAn anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging all the letters of a different word or phrase exactly once. For example, the anagrams of \"eat\" word are \"tea\" and \"ate\".\n\nYou can split each word into characters, followed by sort action and later join them back. After that you can compare those two words to verify whether those two words are anagrams or not.\n\n```javascript\nfunction verifyAnagrams(word1, word2) {\n  return word1.split(\"\").sort().join(\"\") === word2.split(\"\").sort().join(\"\");\n}\nconsole.log(verifyAnagrams(\"eat\", \"ate\"));\n```\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 82. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nprintHello();\n\nprintMessage();\n\nfunction printHello() {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n\n  function printMessage() {\n    console.log(\"Good day\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- 1: Hello, Good day\n- 2: Reference Error: printHello is not defined, Reference Error: printMessage is not defined\n- 3: Reference Error: printHello is not defined, Good day\n- 4: Hello, Reference Error: printMessage is not defined\n\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n\n##### Answer: 4\n\nThe function `printHello` is hoisted to the top of the global scope and prints \"Hello\" to the console. Even `printMessage` function is hoisted, but it is lifted to the local scope(in \"printHello\") it was declared in. That is the reason you will endup with reference error for second function call.\n\nBut if the second function is invoked in the first function itself, there won't be any reference error.\n\n```javascript\nprintHello();\n\nfunction printHello() {\n  printMessage();\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n\n  function printMessage() {\n    console.log(\"Good day\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n---\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 83. What is the time taken to execute below timeout callback?\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"Start code\");\n\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  console.log(\"Callback code\");\n}, 5000);\n\nconsole.log(\"After callback\");\n\nlet startTime = new Date().getTime();\nlet endTime = startTime;\n\nwhile (endTime <= startTime + 10000) {\n  endTime = new Date().getTime();\n}\n\nconsole.log(\"End code\");\n```\n\n- 1: > 10 sec\n- 2: Immediately\n- 3: < 10 sec\n- 4: <= 5sec\n\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n\n##### Answer: 1\n\nEven though there is a timer of 5 seconds supplied to `setTimeout` callback, it won't get executed until the main thread is free and finished executing the remaining part of the code. In this example, the remaining code(while loop) takes 10seconds to finish it's execution. In the mean time, the callback will be stored in callback queue upon completion of its 5 seconds timer. After 10 seconds, the callback will be moved to callstack because the callstack is empty by poping out global execution context.\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 84. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nlet arr = [\"wöchentlich\", \"Woche\", \"wäre\", \"Wann\"];\nconsole.log(arr.sort());\n```\n\n- 1: ['wöchentlich','Woche', 'wäre', 'Wann']\n- 2: ['Wann', 'wäre', 'Woche', 'wöchentlich']\n- 3: ['Wann', 'Woche', 'wäre', 'wöchentlich']\n- 4: ['wäre', 'Wann', 'wöchentlich','Woche']\n\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n\n##### Answer: 3\n\nJavascript has a native method sort that allows sorting an array of elements in-place. It will treat each element as a string and sort it alphabetically. But if you try to sort an array of strings which has non-ASCII characters, you will receive a strange result. This is because characters with an accent have higher character codes.\n\nIn this case, the sort order of an array is ['Wann', 'Woche', 'wäre', 'wöchentlich'].\n\nIf you want to sort an array of string values which has non-ASCII characters in an ascending order, there are two possible options like **localeCompare** and **Intl.Collator** provided by ECMAScript Internationalization API.\n\n**localeCompare:**\n\n```javascript\nlet arr = [\"wöchentlich\", \"Woche\", \"wäre\", \"Wann\"];\nconsole.log(arr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b))); //['Wann', 'wäre', 'Woche', 'wöchentlich']\n```\n\n**Intl.Collator:**\n\n```javascript\nlet arr = [\"wöchentlich\", \"Woche\", \"wäre\", \"Wann\"];\nconsole.log(arr.sort(Intl.Collator().compare)); //['Wann', 'wäre', 'Woche', 'wöchentlich']\n```\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 85. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nfunction func(a, b = 2) {\n  console.log(arguments.length);\n}\n\nfunc(undefined);\nfunc();\n```\n\n- 1: 1, 0\n- 2: 0, 0\n- 3: 0, 1\n- 4: 1, 1\n\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n\n##### Answer: 1\n\nIf a function is called with `undefined`, the `undefined` value is treated as a parameter. But if the function is not passed with any parameters, the `arguments` object doesn't include any argument eventhough the function has default function parameter. Hence, the function invocation with `undefined` has one argument and function call without any arguments has 0 arguments.\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n#### 86. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nfunction func(a, b = 2) {\n  console.log(arguments.length);\n}\n\nfunc(undefined);\nfunc();\n```\n\n- 1: 1, 0\n- 2: 0, 0\n- 3: 0, 1\n- 4: 1, 1\n\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n\n##### Answer: 1\n\nIf a function is called with `undefined`, the `undefined` value is treated as a parameter. But if the function is not passed with any parameters, the `arguments` object doesn't include any argument eventhough the function has default function parameter. Hence, the function invocation with `undefined` has one argument and function call without any arguments has 0 arguments.\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n#### 87. What is the output of below code?\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];\n\n// Count how many numbers are odd\nlet xorAccumulator = numbers.reduce((sum, value) => {\n  return sum + (value % 2);\n}, 0);\n\n// IIFE applying XOR of each element shifted by its index\n(function(arr) {\n  for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {\n    xorAccumulator ^= (arr[index] << index);\n  }\n})(numbers);\n\nconsole.log(xorAccumulator);\n\n```\n\n- 1: 5\n- 2: 7\n- 3: 11\n- 4: 1\n\n<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>\n<p>\n\n##### Answer: 3\n\nThis question is really showcasing how JavaScript mixes array reduction with low-level bitwise tricks. The code first uses .reduce() to turn the array into a single value by counting how many elements are odd, then an IIFE immediately kicks in and loops through the array again, shifting each number left by its index and XOR-ing it into the accumulator. The whole vibe is about understanding how reduction works for summarizing arrays and how bit shifting plus XOR can transform values in a way that feels mathematical rather than typical JS.\n</p>\n</details>\n\n**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe questions provided in this repository are the summary of frequently asked questions across numerous companies.

Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.\n\nHarbor is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of cloud native technologies, consider joining the CNCF. For details about whose involved and how Harbor plays a role, read the CNCF\n[announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/07/31/cncf-to-host-harbor-in-the-sandbox/).\n\n## Features\n\n* **Cloud native registry**: With support for both container images and [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts, Harbor serves as registry for cloud native environments like container runtimes and orchestration platforms.\n* **Role based access control**: Users access different repositories through 'projects' and a user can have different permission for images or Helm charts under a project.\n* **Policy based replication**: Images and charts can be replicated (synchronized) between multiple registry instances based on policies with using filters (repository, tag and label). Harbor automatically retries a replication if it encounters any errors. This can be used to assist loadbalancing, achieve high availability, and facilitate multi-datacenter deployments in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.\n* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Harbor scans images regularly for vulnerabilities and has policy checks to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed.\n* **LDAP/AD support**: Harbor integrates with existing enterprise LDAP/AD for user authentication and management, and supports importing LDAP groups into Harbor that can then be given permissions to specific projects.\n* **OIDC support**: Harbor leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) to verify the identity of users authenticated by an external authorization server or identity provider. Single sign-on can be enabled to log into the Harbor portal.\n* **Image deletion & garbage collection**: System admin can run garbage collection jobs so that images(dangling manifests and unreferenced blobs) can be deleted and their space can be freed up periodically.\n* **Notary**: Support signing container images using Docker Content Trust (leveraging Notary) for guaranteeing authenticity and provenance.  In addition, policies that prevent unsigned images from being deployed can also be activated.\n* **Graphical user portal**: User can easily browse, search repositories and manage projects.\n* **Auditing**: All the operations to the repositories are tracked through logs.\n* **RESTful API**: RESTful APIs are provided to facilitate administrative operations, and are easy to use for integration with external systems. An embedded Swagger UI is available for exploring and testing the API.\n* **Easy deployment**: Harbor can be deployed via Docker compose as well Helm Chart, and a Harbor Operator was added recently as well.\n\n## Architecture\n\nFor learning the architecture design of Harbor, check the document [Architecture Overview of Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Architecture-Overview-of-Harbor).\n\n## API\n\n* Harbor RESTful API: The APIs for most administrative operations of Harbor and can be used to perform integrations with Harbor programmatically.\n  * Part 1: [New or changed APIs](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goharbor/harbor/main/api/v2.0/swagger.yaml)\n\n## Install & Run\n\n**System requirements:**\n\n**On a Linux host:** docker 20.10.10-ce+ and docker-compose 1.18.0+ .\n\nDownload binaries of **[Harbor release ](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases)** and follow **[Installation & Configuration Guide](https://goharbor.io/docs/latest/install-config/)** to install Harbor.\n\nIf you want to deploy Harbor on Kubernetes, please use the **[Harbor chart](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-helm)**.\n\nRefer to the **[documentation](https://goharbor.io/docs/)** for more details on how to use Harbor.\n\n## OCI Distribution Conformance Tests\n\nCheck the OCI distribution conformance tests [report](https://storage.googleapis.com/harbor-conformance-test/report.html) of Harbor.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThe [compatibility list](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/install-config/harbor-compatibility-list/) document provides compatibility information for the Harbor components.\n\n* [Replication adapters](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/install-config/harbor-compatibility-list/#replication-adapters)\n* [OIDC adapters](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/install-config/harbor-compatibility-list/#oidc-adapters)\n* [Scanner adapters](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/install-config/harbor-compatibility-list/#scanner-adapters)\n\n## Community\n\n* **Twitter:** [@project_harbor](https://twitter.com/project_harbor)\n* **User Group:** Join Harbor user email group: [harbor-users@lists.cncf.io](https://lists.cncf.io/g/harbor-users) to get update of Harbor's news, features, releases, or to provide suggestion and feedback.\n* **Developer Group:** Join Harbor developer group: [harbor-dev@lists.cncf.io](https://lists.cncf.io/g/harbor-dev) for discussion on Harbor development and contribution.\n* **Slack:** Join Harbor's community for discussion and ask questions: [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://slack.cncf.io/), channel: [#harbor](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/harbor/) and [#harbor-dev](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/harbor-dev/)\n\n## Demos\n\n* **[Live Demo](https://demo.goharbor.io)** - A demo environment with the latest Harbor stable build installed.

It\nfollows Android design and development best practices and is intended to be a useful reference\nfor developers. As a running app, it's intended to help developers keep up-to-date with the world\nof Android development by providing regular news updates.\n\nThe app is currently in development. The `prodRelease` variant is [available on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.nowinandroid).\n\n# Features\n\n**Now in Android** displays content from the\n[Now in Android](https://developer.android.com/series/now-in-android) series. Users can browse for\nlinks to recent videos, articles and other content. Users can also follow topics they are interested\nin, and be notified when new content is published which matches interests they are following.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![Screenshot showing For You screen, Interests screen and Topic detail screen](docs/images/screenshots.png \"Screenshot showing For You screen, Interests screen and Topic detail screen\")\n\n# Development Environment\n\n**Now in Android** uses the Gradle build system and can be imported directly into Android Studio (make sure you are using the latest stable version available [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)). \n\nChange the run configuration to `app`.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/873212/210559920-ef4a40c5-c8e0-478b-bb00-4879a8cf184a.png)\n\nThe `demoDebug` and `demoRelease` build variants can be built and run (the `prod` variants use a backend server which is not currently publicly available).\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/873212/210560507-44045dc5-b6d5-41ca-9746-f0f7acf22f8e.png)\n\nOnce you're up and running, you can refer to the learning journeys below to get a better\nunderstanding of which libraries and tools are being used, the reasoning behind the approaches to\nUI, testing, architecture and more, and how all of these different pieces of the project fit\ntogether to create a complete app.\n\n# Architecture\n\nThe **Now in Android** app follows the\n[official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) \nand is described in detail in the\n[architecture learning journey](docs/ArchitectureLearningJourney.md).\n\n# Modularization\n\nThe **Now in Android** app has been fully modularized and you can find the detailed guidance and\ndescription of the modularization strategy used in\n[modularization learning journey](docs/ModularizationLearningJourney.md).\n\n# Build\n\nThe app contains the usual `debug` and `release` build variants. \n\nIn addition, the `benchmark` variant of `app` is used to test startup performance and generate a\nbaseline profile (see below for more information).\n\n`app-nia-catalog` is a standalone app that displays the list of components that are stylized for\n**Now in Android**.\n\nThe app also uses\n[product flavors](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#product-flavors) to\ncontrol where content for the app should be loaded from.\n\nThe `demo` flavor uses static local data to allow immediate building and exploring of the UI.\n\nThe `prod` flavor makes real network calls to a backend server, providing up-to-date content. At \nthis time, there is not a public backend available.\n\nFor normal development use the `demoDebug` variant. For UI performance testing use the\n`demoRelease` variant. \n\n# Testing\n\nTo facilitate testing of components, **Now in Android** uses dependency injection with\n[Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).\n\nMost data layer components are defined as interfaces.\nThen, concrete implementations (with various dependencies) are bound to provide those interfaces to\nother components in the app.\nIn tests, **Now in Android** notably does _not_ use any mocking libraries.\nInstead, the production implementations can be replaced with test doubles using Hilt's testing APIs\n(or via manual constructor injection for `ViewModel` tests).\n\nThese test doubles implement the same interface as the production implementations and generally\nprovide a simplified (but still realistic) implementation with additional testing hooks.\nThis results in less brittle tests that may exercise more production code, instead of just verifying\nspecific calls against mocks.\n\nExamples:\n- In instrumentation tests, a temporary folder is used to store the user's preferences, which is\n  wiped after each test.\n  This allows using the real `DataStore` and exercising all related code, instead of mocking the \n  flow of data updates.\n\n- There are `Test` implementations of each repository, which implement the normal, full repository\n  interface and also provide test-only hooks.\n  `ViewModel` tests use these `Test` repositories, and thus can use the test-only hooks to\n  manipulate the state of the `Test` repository and verify the resulting behavior, instead of\n  checking that specific repository methods were called.\n\nTo run the tests execute the following gradle tasks: \n\n- `testDemoDebug` run all local tests against the `demoDebug` variant. Screenshot tests will fail\n(see below for explanation). To avoid this, run `recordRoborazziDemoDebug` prior to running unit tests.\n- `connectedDemoDebugAndroidTest` run all instrumented tests against the `demoDebug` variant. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You should not run `./gradlew test` or `./gradlew connectedAndroidTest` as this will execute \ntests against _all_ build variants which is both unnecessary and will result in failures as only the\n`demoDebug` variant is supported. No other variants have any tests (although this might change in future). \n\n## Screenshot tests\nA screenshot test takes a screenshot of a screen or a UI component within the app, and compares it \nwith a previously recorded screenshot which is known to be rendered correctly. \n\nFor example, Now in Android has [screenshot tests](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/blob/main/app/src/testDemo/kotlin/com/google/samples/apps/nowinandroid/ui/NiaAppScreenSizesScreenshotTests.kt)\nto verify that the navigation is displayed correctly on different screen sizes \n([known correct screenshots](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/tree/main/app/src/testDemo/screenshots)). \n\nNow In Android uses [Roborazzi](https://github.com/takahirom/roborazzi) to run screenshot tests\nof certain screens and UI components. When working with screenshot tests the following gradle tasks are useful:\n\n- `verifyRoborazziDemoDebug` run all screenshot tests, verifying the screenshots against the known\ncorrect screenshots.\n- `recordRoborazziDemoDebug` record new \"known correct\" screenshots. Use this command when you have\nmade changes to the UI and manually verified that they are rendered correctly. Screenshots will be\nstored in `modulename/src/test/screenshots`.\n- `compareRoborazziDemoDebug` create comparison images between failed tests and the known correct\nimages. These can also be found in `modulename/src/test/screenshots`. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Note on failing screenshot tests**   \n> The known correct screenshots stored in this repository are recorded on CI using Linux. Other\nplatforms may (and probably will) generate slightly different images, making the screenshot tests fail. \nWhen working on a non-Linux platform, a workaround to this is to run `recordRoborazziDemoDebug` on the\n`main` branch before starting work. After making changes, `verifyRoborazziDemoDebug` will identify only\nlegitimate changes. \n\nFor more information about screenshot testing \n[check out this talk](https://www.droidcon.com/2023/11/15/easy-screenshot-testing-with-compose/).\n\n# UI\nThe app was designed using [Material 3 guidelines](https://m3.material.io/). Learn more about the design process and \nobtain the design files in the [Now in Android Material 3 Case Study](https://goo.gle/nia-figma) (design assets [also available as a PDF](docs/Now-In-Android-Design-File.pdf)).\n\nThe Screens and UI elements are built entirely using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). \n\nThe app has two themes: \n\n- Dynamic color - uses colors based on the [user's current color theme](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you) (if supported)\n- Default theme - uses predefined colors when dynamic color is not supported\n\nEach theme also supports dark mode. \n\nThe app uses adaptive layouts to\n[support different screen sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/support-different-screen-sizes).\n\nFind out more about the [UI architecture here](docs/ArchitectureLearningJourney.md#ui-layer).\n\n# Performance\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nFind all tests written using [`Macrobenchmark`](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/benchmarking/macrobenchmark-overview)\nin the `benchmarks` module. This module also contains the test to generate the Baseline profile.\n\n## Baseline profiles\n\nThe baseline profile for this app is located at [`app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`](app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt).\nIt contains rules that enable AOT compilation of the critical user path taken during app launch.\nFor more information on baseline profiles, read [this document](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/baselineprofiles).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The baseline profile needs to be re-generated for release builds that touch code which changes app startup.\n\nTo generate the baseline profile, select the `benchmark` build variant and run the\n`BaselineProfileGenerator` benchmark test on an AOSP Android Emulator.\nThen copy the resulting baseline profile from the emulator to [`app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt`](app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt).\n\n## Compose compiler metrics\n\nRun the following command to get and analyze compose compiler metrics:\n\n```bash\n./gradlew assembleRelease -PenableComposeCompilerMetrics=true -PenableComposeCompilerReports=true\n```\n\nThe reports files will be added to [build/compose-reports](build/compose-reports). The metrics files will also be \nadded to [build/compose-metrics](build/compose-metrics).\n\nFor more information on Compose compiler metrics, see [this blog post](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/jetpack-compose-stability-explained-79c10db270c8).\n\n# License\n\n**Now in Android** is distributed under the terms of the Apache License (Version 2.0).

      "readme": "# <img align=\"center\" height=\"70\" src=\"./Docs/Images/AppIcon.png\"/> GitHub Copilot for Xcode\n\n[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) for Xcode is the leading AI coding assistant for Swift, Objective-C and iOS/macOS development. It delivers intelligent Completions, Chat, and Code Review—plus advanced features like Agent Mode, Next Edit Suggestions, MCP Registry, and Copilot Vision to make Xcode development faster and smarter.\n\n## Chat\n\nGitHub Copilot Chat provides suggestions to your specific coding tasks via chat.\n<img alt=\"Chat of GitHub Copilot for Xcode\" src=\"./Docs/Images/chat_agent.gif\" width=\"800\" />\n\n## Agent Mode\n\nGitHub Copilot Agent Mode provides AI-powered assistance that can understand and modify your codebase directly. With Agent Mode, you can:\n- Get intelligent code edits applied directly to your files\n- Run terminal commands and view their output without leaving the interface\n- Search through your codebase to find relevant files and code snippets\n- Create new files and directories as needed for your project\n- Get assistance with enhanced context awareness across multiple files and folders\n- Run Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools you configured to extend the capabilities\n\nAgent Mode integrates with Xcode's environment, creating a seamless development experience where Copilot can help implement features, fix bugs, and refactor code with comprehensive understanding of your project.\n\n## Code Completion\n\nYou can receive auto-complete type suggestions from GitHub Copilot either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.\n<img alt=\"Code Completion of GitHub Copilot for Xcode\" src=\"./Docs/Images/demo.gif\" width=\"800\" />\n\n## Requirements\n\n- macOS 12+\n- Xcode 8+\n- A GitHub account\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n   ```sh\n   brew install --cask github-copilot-for-xcode\n   ```\n\n   Or download the `dmg` from\n   [the latest release](https://github.com/github/CopilotForXcode/releases/latest/download/GitHubCopilotForXcode.dmg).\n   Drag `GitHub Copilot for Xcode` into the `Applications` folder:\n\n   <p align=\"center\">\n     <img alt=\"Screenshot of opened dmg\" src=\"./Docs/Images/dmg-open.png\" width=\"512\" />\n   </p>\n\n   Updates can be downloaded and installed by the app.\n\n1. Open the `GitHub Copilot for Xcode` application (from the `Applications` folder). Accept the security warning.\n   <p align=\"center\">\n     <img alt=\"Screenshot of MacOS download permission request\" src=\"./Docs/Images/macos-download-open-confirm.png\" width=\"350\" />\n   </p>\n\n\n1. A background item will be added to enable the GitHub Copilot for Xcode extension app to connect to the host app. This permission is usually automatically added when first launching the app.\n   <p align=\"center\">\n     <img alt=\"Screenshot of background item\" src=\"./Docs/Images/background-item.png\" width=\"370\" />\n   </p>\n\n1. Three permissions are required for GitHub Copilot for Xcode to function properly: `Background`, `Accessibility`, and `Xcode Source Editor Extension`. For more details on why these permissions are required see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).\n\n   The first time the application is run the `Accessibility` permission should be requested:\n\n   <p align=\"center\">\n     <img alt=\"Screenshot of accessibility permission request\" src=\"./Docs/Images/accessibility-permission-request.png\" width=\"529\" />\n   </p>\n\n   The `Xcode Source Editor Extension` permission needs to be enabled manually. Click\n   `Extension Permission` from the `GitHub Copilot for Xcode` application settings to open the\n   System Preferences to the `Extensions` panel. Select `Xcode Source Editor`\n   and enable `GitHub Copilot`:\n\n   <p align=\"center\">\n     <img alt=\"Screenshot of extension permission\" src=\"./Docs/Images/extension-permission.png\" width=\"582\" />\n   </p>\n\n1. After granting the extension permission, open Xcode. Verify that the\n   `Github Copilot` menu is available and enabled under the Xcode `Editor`\n   menu.\n    <br>\n    <p align=\"center\">\n      <img alt=\"Screenshot of Xcode Editor GitHub Copilot menu item\" src=\"./Docs/Images/xcode-menu.png\" width=\"648\" />\n    </p>\n\n    Keyboard shortcuts can be set for all menu items in the `Key Bindings`\n    section of Xcode preferences.\n\n1. To sign into GitHub Copilot, click the `Sign in` button in the settings application. This will open a browser window and copy a code to the clipboard. Paste the code into the GitHub login page and authorize the application.\n    <p align=\"center\">\n      <img alt=\"Screenshot of sign-in popup\" src=\"./Docs/Images/device-code.png\" width=\"372\" />\n    </p>\n\n1. To install updates, click `Check for Updates` from the menu item or in the\n   settings application.\n\n   After installing a new version, Xcode must be restarted to use the new\n   version correctly.\n\n   New versions can also be installed from `dmg` files downloaded from the\n   releases page. When installing a new version via `dmg`, the application must\n   be run manually the first time to accept the downloaded from the internet\n   warning.\n\n1. To avoid confusion, we recommend disabling `Predictive code completion` under\n   `Xcode` > `Preferences` > `Text Editing` > `Editing`.\n\n1. Press `tab` to accept the first line of a suggestion, hold `option` to view\n   the full suggestion, and press `option` + `tab` to accept the full suggestion.\n\n## How to use Chat\n\n   Open Copilot Chat in GitHub Copilot.\n  - Open via the Xcode menu `Xcode -> Editor -> GitHub Copilot -> Open Chat`.\n  <p align=\"center\">\n    <img alt=\"Screenshot of Xcode Editor GitHub Copilot menu item\" src=\"./Docs/Images/xcode-menu_dark.png\" width=\"648\" />\n  </p>\n\n  - Open via GitHub Copilot app menu `Open Chat`.\n\n  <p align=\"center\">\n    <img alt=\"Screenshot of GitHub Copilot menu item\" src=\"./Docs/Images/copilot-menu_dark.png\" width=\"244\" />\n  </p>\n\n## How to use Code Completion\n\n   Press `tab` to accept the first line of a suggestion, hold `option` to view\n   the full suggestion, and press `option` + `tab` to accept the full suggestion.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the MIT open source license.

It provides:\n\n- **Blazing Fast Performance**\n  - 100x faster random access reads (vs. modern Apache Parquet)\n  - 10-20x faster scans\n  - 5x faster writes\n  - Similar compression ratios\n  - Efficient support for wide tables with zero-copy/zero-parse metadata\n\n- **Extensible Architecture**\n  - Modeled after Apache DataFusion's extensible approach\n  - Pluggable encoding system, type system, compression strategy, & layout strategy\n  - Zero-copy compatibility with Apache Arrow\n\n- **Open Source, Neutral Governance**\n  - A Linux Foundation (LF AI & Data) Project\n  - Apache-2.0 Licensed\n\n- **Integrations**\n  - Arrow, DataFusion, DuckDB, Spark, Pandas, Polars, & more\n  - Apache Iceberg (coming soon)\n\n> 🟢 **Development Status**: Library APIs may change from version to version, but we now consider\n> the file format <ins>_stable_</ins>. From release 0.36.0, all future releases of Vortex should\n> maintain backwards compatibility of the file format (i.e., be able to read files written by\n> any earlier version >= 0.36.0).\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Core Capabilities\n\n- **Logical Types** - Clean separation between logical schema and physical layout\n- **Zero-Copy Arrow Integration** - Seamless conversion to/from Apache Arrow arrays\n- **Extensible Encodings** - Pluggable physical layouts with built-in optimizations\n- **Cascading Compression** - Support for nested encoding schemes\n- **High-Performance Computing** - Optimized compute kernels for encoded data\n- **Rich Statistics** - Lazy-loaded summary statistics for optimization\n\n### Technical Architecture\n\n#### Logical vs Physical Design\n\nVortex strictly separates logical and physical concerns:\n\n- **Logical Layer**: Defines data types and schema\n- **Physical Layer**: Handles encoding and storage implementation\n- **Built-in Encodings**: Compatible with Apache Arrow's memory format\n- **Extension Encodings**: Optimized compression schemes (RLE, dictionary, etc.)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installation\n\n#### Rust Crate\n\nAll features are exported through the main `vortex` crate.\n\n```bash\ncargo add vortex\n```\n\n#### Python Package\n\n```bash\nuv add vortex-data\n```\n\n#### Command Line UI (vx)\n\nFor browsing the structure of Vortex files, you can use the `vx` command-line tool.\n\n```bash\n# Install latest release\ncargo install vortex-tui --locked\n\n# Or build from source\ncargo install --path vortex-tui --locked\n\n# Usage\nvx browse <file>\n```\n\n### Development Setup\n\n#### Prerequisites (macOS)\n\n```bash\n# Optional but recommended dependencies\nbrew install flatbuffers protobuf  # For .fbs and .proto files\nbrew install duckdb               # For benchmarks\n\n# Install Rust toolchain\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n# or\nbrew install rustup\n\n# Initialize submodules\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n\n# Setup dependencies with uv\nuv sync --all-packages\n```\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\nFor optimal performance, we suggest using [MiMalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc):\n\n```rust,ignore\n#[global_allocator]\nstatic GLOBAL_ALLOC: MiMalloc = MiMalloc;\n```\n\n## Project Information\n\n### License\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\n\n### Governance\n\nVortex is an independent open-source project and not controlled by any single company.

      "readme": "# TEESimulator – A Full TEE Emulation Framework\n\n**TEESimulator** is a system module designed to create a complete, software-based simulation of a hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environment ([TEE](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/trusty)) for [Key Attestation](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-key-attestation).\n\nThe project's goal is to move beyond simple certificate patching and build a robust framework that can create and manage virtual, self-consistent cryptographic keys.\n\n## ✨ Core Principles\n\n*   **Bypass Hardware-Backed Attestation:** The primary goal of this project is to defeat Key Attestation, a security mechanism that allows apps to verify that they are running on a secure, unmodified device. This module provides the tools to bypass these checks on rooted or modified devices.\n*   **Stateful Emulation:** Instead of patching responses from the real TEE, the ultimate goal is to create and manage virtual keys entirely in a simulated software environment. Any request concerning a virtual key will be handled by the simulator, ensuring perfect consistency without ever touching the real hardware.\n*   **Architectural Interception:** By hooking low-level Binder IPC calls to the Keystore, the framework can transparently redirect requests for virtual keys to the software-based simulator, while allowing requests for real keys to pass through to the hardware TEE.\n*   **100% FOSS:** Licensed under GPLv3, ensuring it stays free, auditable, and compliant with open-source laws.\n\n## 📱 Requirements\n- Android 10 or above\n\n## 📦 Installation & Configuration\n\n1.  Flash this module via (Magisk / KernelSU / APatch) and reboot. It will replace [TrickyStore](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore), [TrickyStoreOSS](https://github.com/beakthoven/TrickyStoreOSS) and their forks.\n2.  (Optional) Place a hardware-backed `keybox.xml` at `/data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml`. This provides the cryptographic \"root of trust\" for the simulator.\n3.  (Optional) Customize target packages in `/data/adb/tricky_store/target.txt`.\n4.  (Optional) Customize the simulated security patch level in `/data/adb/tricky_store/security_patch.txt`.\n5.  Enjoy!\n\n**All configuration files are monitored and will take effect immediately upon saving.**\n\n### The `keybox.xml` Root of Trust\n\nThis file provides the master cryptographic identity for the simulator. It contains a private key and a valid, hardware-backed certificate chain from a real device. The simulator uses this to sign the virtual certificates it generates, making them appear legitimate to verifiers.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<AndroidAttestation>\n    <Keybox DeviceID=\"...\">\n        <Key algorithm=\"ecdsa|rsa\">\n            <PrivateKey format=\"pem\">...</PrivateKey>\n            <CertificateChain>...</CertificateChain>\n        </Key>\n    </Keybox>\n</AndroidAttestation>\n```\n\n### Mode and Keybox Configuration (`target.txt`)\n\nTEESimulator currently operates in two primary modes as it transitions towards full emulation.\nYou can control the simulation mode and the specific keybox.xml file used on a per-package basis.\n\n#### Mode Suffixes\n\n*   **`!` → Force Generation Mode:** Creates a complete, software-based virtual key. This is the foundation of the full TEE simulation.\n*   **`?` → Force Leaf Hacking Mode:** A legacy mode where a real TEE key is generated, but its attestation certificate is intercepted and modified.\n*   **No symbol → Automatic Mode:** The module selects the most appropriate mode for the device.\n\n#### Multi-Keybox Configuration\n\nYou can specify different keybox files for different groups of applications. This is done by adding a line with the filename in square brackets (e.g., [demo_keybox.xml]).\n\nAll applications listed after this line will use the specified keybox file, until a new keybox is declared. Applications listed before any custom keybox declaration will use the default `keybox.xml`.\n\nFor example:\n```\n# These two apps will use the default /data/adb/tricky_store/keybox.xml\ncom.google.android.gms!\nio.github.vvb2060.keyattestation?\n\n# Switch to a different keybox for the following apps.\n# The file must be located at /data/adb/tricky_store/aosp_keybox.xml\n[aosp_keybox.xml]\ncom.google.android.gsf\n\n# Switch again to another keybox.\n# The file must be located at /data/adb/tricky_store/demo_keybox.xml\n[demo_keybox.xml]\norg.matrix.demo\n```\n\n### Security Patch Level (`security_patch.txt`)\n\nThis file allows you to configure the `osPatchLevel`, `vendorPatchLevel`, and `bootPatchLevel` that the simulator will report in its patched or forged attestation certificates.\n\n**Note:** This only affects the Key Attestation data generated by the simulator. It does not change the actual system properties of your device.\n\n#### Global and Per-Package Configuration\n\nYou can set a global patch level that applies to all applications, and you can also override these settings for specific packages. The syntax is hierarchical:\n\n*   Settings defined at the top of the file, before any `[package.name]` line, are **global** and serve as the default for all apps.\n*   To create a specific configuration for an application, add its package name in square brackets (e.g., `[com.google.android.gms]`). All settings following this line will apply *only* to that package until a new package context is declared.\n\n#### Configuration Keys and Values\n\nYou can specify the patch level for the following components using a `key=value` format:\n\n*   `system`: The main OS patch level.\n*   `vendor`: The vendor patch level.\n*   `boot`: The boot/kernel patch level.\n*   `all`: A convenient shorthand to set the same date for `system`, `vendor`, and `boot` simultaneously. Any individual key can still be used to override the value set by `all`.\n\nDates should be provided in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2025-11-05`).\n\n#### Special Keywords\n\nIn addition to static dates, several special keywords provide advanced, dynamic control:\n\n*   **`today`**: Dynamically uses the current date every time an attestation is generated. This ensures the device always appears up-to-date without needing manual edits.\n\n*   **Date Templates**: You can create semi-dynamic dates using `YYYY`, `MM`, and `DD` as placeholders for the current year, month, and day. For example, `YYYY-MM-05` will always resolve to the 5th of the current month and year.\n\n*   **`no`**: This keyword instructs the simulator to **completely omit** the corresponding patch level tag from the generated attestation.\n\n*   **`device_default`**: This keyword forces the simulator to fall back and use the device's **real hardware value** for that specific patch level. This is essential for creating exceptions to a global override or an `all` rule.\n\n#### Example Configuration\n\nThis example demonstrates how to combine global settings, per-package overrides, and special keywords for fine-grained control.\n\n```\n# --- Global Configuration ---\n# This is the default for all apps unless specified otherwise.\n# - Forge a recent system patch level, the 5th of the current month (a common patch date).\n# - Use the device's real vendor patch level.\n# - Do not report a boot patch level at all.\nsystem=YYYY-MM-05\nvendor=device_default\nboot=no\n\n# --- Per-Package Override for Google Play Services ---\n# This app will report an older, specific date for its system patch.\n# It will inherit the global settings for vendor (device_default) and boot (no).\n[com.google.android.gms]\nsystem=2024-10-01\n\n# --- Per-Package Override for a Demo App ---\n# This app gets a completely custom configuration.\n[org.matrix.demo]\n# Set a base date for all patch levels...\nall=2025-09-15\n# ...but make an exception: use the real boot patch level instead of the one from 'all'.\nboot=device_default\n```\n",

Iceberg brings the reliability and simplicity of SQL tables to big data, while making it possible for engines like Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto, Hive and Impala to safely work with the same tables, at the same time.\n\nBackground and documentation is available at <https://iceberg.apache.org>\n\n\n## Status\n\nIceberg is under active development at the Apache Software Foundation.\n\nThe [Iceberg format specification][iceberg-spec] is stable and new features are added with each version.\n\nThe core Java library is located in this repository and is the reference implementation for other libraries.\n\n[Documentation][iceberg-docs] is available for all libraries and integrations.\n\n[iceberg-docs]: https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/\n[iceberg-spec]: https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/\n\n## Collaboration\n\nIceberg tracks issues in GitHub and prefers to receive contributions as pull requests.\n\nCommunity discussions happen primarily on the [dev mailing list][dev-list] or on specific issues.\n\n[dev-list]: mailto:dev@iceberg.apache.org\n\n\n### Building\n\nIceberg is built using Gradle with Java 11, 17, or 21.\n\n* To invoke a build and run tests: `./gradlew build`\n* To skip tests: `./gradlew build -x test -x integrationTest`\n* To fix code style for default versions: `./gradlew spotlessApply`\n* To fix code style for all versions of Spark/Hive/Flink:`./gradlew spotlessApply -DallModules`\n\nIceberg table support is organized in library modules:\n\n* `iceberg-common` contains utility classes used in other modules\n* `iceberg-api` contains the public Iceberg API\n* `iceberg-core` contains implementations of the Iceberg API and support for Avro data files, **this is what processing engines should depend on**\n* `iceberg-parquet` is an optional module for working with tables backed by Parquet files\n* `iceberg-arrow` is an optional module for reading Parquet into Arrow memory\n* `iceberg-orc` is an optional module for working with tables backed by ORC files\n* `iceberg-hive-metastore` is an implementation of Iceberg tables backed by the Hive metastore Thrift client\n* `iceberg-data` is an optional module for working with tables directly from JVM applications\n\nIceberg also has modules for adding Iceberg support to processing engines:\n\n* `iceberg-spark` is an implementation of Spark's Datasource V2 API for Iceberg with submodules for each spark versions (use [runtime jars](https://iceberg.apache.org/multi-engine-support/#runtime-jar) for a shaded version to avoid dependency conflicts)\n* `iceberg-flink` contains classes for integrating with Apache Flink (use [iceberg-flink-runtime](https://iceberg.apache.org/multi-engine-support/#runtime-jar) for a shaded version)\n* `iceberg-mr` contains an InputFormat and other classes for integrating with Apache Hive\n\n---\n**NOTE**\n\nThe tests require Docker to execute. On macOS (with Docker Desktop), you might need to create a symbolic name to the docker socket in order to be detected by the tests:\n\n```\nsudo ln -s $HOME/.docker/run/docker.sock /var/run/docker.sock\n```\n\nIn some cases the testcontainer may exit with an initialization error because of an illegal state exception in the GenericContainer.  One work around for this problem is to set `selinux` into permissive mode before running the tests. \n\n```\nsudo setenforce Permissive\n./gradlew ...\nsudo setenforce Enforcing\n```\n\n---\n\n### Engine Compatibility\n\nSee the [Multi-Engine Support](https://iceberg.apache.org/multi-engine-support/) page to know about Iceberg compatibility with different Spark, Flink and Hive versions.\nFor other engines such as Presto or Trino, please visit their websites for Iceberg integration details.\n\n### Implementations\n\nThis repository contains the Java implementation of Iceberg. Other implementations can be found at:\n\n* **Go**: [iceberg-go](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-go)\n* **PyIceberg** (Python): [iceberg-python](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-python)\n* **Rust**: [iceberg-rust](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-rust)\n* **C++**: [iceberg-cpp](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-cpp)\n",

Similar to [kubectl logging levels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/quick-reference/#kubectl-output-verbosity-and-debugging). |\n| `--config`                | (Optional) Path to the main TOML configuration file. See [Drop-in Configuration](#drop-in-configuration) section below for details.                                                                                                                                                          |\n| `--config-dir`            | (Optional) Path to drop-in configuration directory. Files are loaded in lexical (alphabetical) order. Defaults to `conf.d` relative to the main config file if `--config` is specified. See [Drop-in Configuration](#drop-in-configuration) section below for details.                       |\n| `--kubeconfig`            | Path to the Kubernetes configuration file. If not provided, it will try to resolve the configuration (in-cluster, default location, etc.).                                                                                                                                                    |\n| `--list-output`           | Output format for resource list operations (one of: yaml, table) (default \"table\")                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `--read-only`             | If set, the MCP server will run in read-only mode, meaning it will not allow any write operations (create, update, delete) on the Kubernetes cluster. This is useful for debugging or inspecting the cluster without making changes.                                                          |\n| `--disable-destructive`   | If set, the MCP server will disable all destructive operations (delete, update, etc.) on the Kubernetes cluster. This is useful for debugging or inspecting the cluster without accidentally making changes. This option has no effect when `--read-only` is used.                            |\n| `--stateless`             | If set, the MCP server will run in stateless mode, disabling tool and prompt change notifications. This is useful for container deployments, load balancing, and serverless environments where maintaining client state is not desired. |\n| `--toolsets`              | Comma-separated list of toolsets to enable. Check the [🛠️ Tools and Functionalities](#tools-and-functionalities) section for more information.                                                                                                                                               |\n| `--disable-multi-cluster` | If set, the MCP server will disable multi-cluster support and will only use the current context from the kubeconfig file. This is useful if you want to restrict the MCP server to a single cluster.                                                                                          |\n\n### Drop-in Configuration <a id=\"drop-in-configuration\"></a>\n\nThe Kubernetes MCP server supports flexible configuration through both a main config file and drop-in files. **Both are optional** - you can use either, both, or neither (server will use built-in defaults).\n\n#### Configuration Loading Order\n\nConfiguration values are loaded and merged in the following order (later sources override earlier ones):\n\n1. **Internal Defaults** - Always loaded (hardcoded default values)\n2. **Main Configuration File** - Optional, loaded via `--config` flag\n3. **Drop-in Files** - Optional, loaded from `--config-dir` in **lexical (alphabetical) order**\n\n#### How Drop-in Files Work\n\n- **Default Directory**: If `--config-dir` is not specified, the server looks for drop-in files in `conf.d/` relative to the main config file's directory (when `--config` is provided)\n- **File Naming**: Use numeric prefixes to control loading order (e.g., `00-base.toml`, `10-cluster.toml`, `99-override.toml`)\n- **File Extension**: Only `.toml` files are processed; dotfiles (starting with `.`) are ignored\n- **Partial Configuration**: Drop-in files can contain only a subset of configuration options\n- **Merge Behavior**: Values present in a drop-in file override previous values; missing values are preserved\n\n#### Dynamic Configuration Reload\n\nTo reload configuration after modifying config files, send a `SIGHUP` signal to the running server process.\n\n**Prerequisite**: SIGHUP reload requires the server to be started with either the `--config` flag or `--config-dir` flag (or both). If neither is specified, SIGHUP signals will be ignored.\n\n**How to reload:**\n\n```shell\n# Find the process ID\nps aux | grep kubernetes-mcp-server\n\n# Send SIGHUP to reload configuration\nkill -HUP <pid>\n\n# Or use pkill\npkill -HUP kubernetes-mcp-server\n```\n\nThe server will:\n- Reload the main config file and all drop-in files\n- Update configuration values (log level, output format, etc.)\n- Rebuild the toolset registry with new tool configurations\n- Log the reload status\n\n**Note**: Changing `kubeconfig` or cluster-related settings requires a server restart. Only tool configurations, log levels, and output formats can be reloaded dynamically.\n\n**Note**: SIGHUP reload is not available on Windows. On Windows, restart the server to reload configuration.\n\n#### Example: Using Both Config Methods\n\n**Command (using default `conf.d` directory):**\n```shell\nkubernetes-mcp-server --config /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml\n```\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```\n/etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/\n├── config.toml              # Main configuration\n└── conf.d/                  # Default drop-in directory (automatically loaded)\n    ├── 00-base.toml         # Base overrides\n    ├── 10-toolsets.toml     # Toolset-specific config\n    └── 99-local.toml        # Local overrides\n```\n\n**Command (with explicit `--config-dir`):**\n```shell\nkubernetes-mcp-server --config /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.toml \\\n                      --config-dir /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/config.d/\n```\n\n**Example drop-in file** (`10-toolsets.toml`):\n```toml\n# Override only the toolsets - all other config preserved\ntoolsets = [\"core\", \"config\", \"helm\", \"logs\"]\n```\n\n**Example drop-in file** (`99-local.toml`):\n```toml\n# Local development overrides\nlog_level = 9\nread_only = true\n```\n\n**To apply changes:**\n```shell\n# Edit config files\nvim /etc/kubernetes-mcp-server/conf.d/99-local.toml\n\n# Reload without restarting\npkill -HUP kubernetes-mcp-server\n```\n\n### MCP Prompts\n\n1. The server supports MCP prompts for workflow templates. Define custom prompts in `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[[prompts]]\nname = \"my-workflow\"\ntitle = \"my workflow\"\ndescription = \"Custom workflow\"\n\n[[prompts.arguments]]\nname = \"resource_name\"\nrequired = true\n\n[[prompts.messages]]\nrole = \"user\"\ncontent = \"Help me with {{resource_name}}\"\n```\n\n2.

      "readme": "= Elasticsearch\n\nElasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store and vector database optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Elasticsearch is the foundation of Elastic's open Stack platform. Search in near real-time over massive datasets, perform vector searches, integrate with generative AI applications, and much more.\n\nUse cases enabled by Elasticsearch include:\n\n* https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/articles/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]\n* https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/vector-search[Vector search]\n* Full-text search\n* Logs\n* Metrics\n* Application performance monitoring (APM)\n* Security logs\n\n\\... and more!\n\nTo learn more about Elasticsearch's features and capabilities, see our\nhttps://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[product page].\n\nTo access information on https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/ml-research[machine learning innovations] and the latest https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/lucene[Lucene contributions from Elastic], more information can be found in https://www.elastic.co/search-labs[Search Labs].\n\n[[get-started]]\n== Get started\n\nThe simplest way to set up Elasticsearch is to create a managed deployment with\nhttps://www.elastic.co/cloud/as-a-service[Elasticsearch Service on Elastic\nCloud].\n\nIf you prefer to install and manage Elasticsearch yourself, you can download\nthe latest version from\nhttps://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch].\n\n=== Run Elasticsearch locally\n\n////\nIMPORTANT: This content is replicated in the Elasticsearch repo. See `run-elasticsearch-locally.asciidoc`.\nEnsure both files are in sync.\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/start-local is the source of truth.\n////\n\n[WARNING]\n====\nDO NOT USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS.\n\nThis setup is intended for local development and testing only.\n====\n\nQuickly set up Elasticsearch and Kibana in Docker for local development or testing, using the https://github.com/elastic/start-local?tab=readme-ov-file#-try-elasticsearch-and-kibana-locally[`start-local` script].\n\nℹ️ For more detailed information about the `start-local` setup, refer to the https://github.com/elastic/start-local[README on GitHub].\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n- If you don't have Docker installed, https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[download and install Docker Desktop] for your operating system.\n- If you're using Microsoft Windows, then install https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)].\n\n==== Trial license\nThis setup comes with a one-month trial license that includes all Elastic features.\n\nAfter the trial period, the license reverts to *Free and open - Basic*.\nRefer to https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Elastic subscriptions] for more information.\n\n==== Run `start-local`\n\nTo set up Elasticsearch and Kibana locally, run the `start-local` script:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\ncurl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh\n----\n// NOTCONSOLE\n\nThis script creates an `elastic-start-local` folder containing configuration files and starts both Elasticsearch and Kibana using Docker.\n\nAfter running the script, you can access Elastic services at the following endpoints:\n\n* *Elasticsearch*: http://localhost:9200\n* *Kibana*: http://localhost:5601\n\nThe script generates a random password for the `elastic` user, which is displayed at the end of the installation and stored in the `.env` file.\n\n[CAUTION]\n====\nThis setup is for local testing only. HTTPS is disabled, and Basic authentication is used for Elasticsearch. For security, Elasticsearch and Kibana are accessible only through `localhost`.\n====\n\n==== API access\n\nAn API key for Elasticsearch is generated and stored in the `.env` file as `ES_LOCAL_API_KEY`.\nUse this key to connect to Elasticsearch with a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[programming language client] or the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html[REST API].\n\nFrom the `elastic-start-local` folder, check the connection to Elasticsearch using `curl`:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\nsource .env\ncurl $ES_LOCAL_URL -H \"Authorization: ApiKey ${ES_LOCAL_API_KEY}\"\n----\n\nTo use the password for the `elastic` user, set and export the `ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD` environment variable. For example:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\nsource .env\nexport ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD\n----\n\n// NOTCONSOLE\n\n=== Send requests to Elasticsearch\n\nYou send data and other requests to Elasticsearch through REST APIs.\nYou can interact with Elasticsearch using any client that sends HTTP requests,\nsuch as the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[Elasticsearch\nlanguage clients] and https://curl.se[curl].\n\n==== Using curl\n\nHere's an example curl command to create a new Elasticsearch index, using basic auth:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\ncurl -u elastic:$ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD \\\n  -X PUT \\\n  http://localhost:9200/my-new-index \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n----\n\n// NOTCONSOLE\n\n==== Using a language client\n\nTo connect to your local dev Elasticsearch cluster with a language client, you can use basic authentication with the `elastic` username and the password stored in the `ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD` environment variable.\n\nYou'll use the following connection details:\n\n* **Elasticsearch endpoint**: `http://localhost:9200`\n* **Username**: `elastic`\n* **Password**: `$ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD` (Value you set in the environment variable)\n\nFor example, to connect with the Python `elasticsearch` client:\n\n[source,python]\n----\nimport os\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n\nusername = 'elastic'\npassword = os.getenv('ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD') # Value you set in the environment variable\n\nclient = Elasticsearch(\n    \"http://localhost:9200\",\n    basic_auth=(username, password)\n)\n\nprint(client.info())\n----\n\n==== Using the Dev Tools Console\n\nKibana's developer console provides an easy way to experiment and test requests.\nTo access the console, open Kibana, then go to **Management** > **Dev Tools**.\n\n**Add data**\n\nYou index data into Elasticsearch by sending JSON objects (documents) through the REST APIs.\nWhether you have structured or unstructured text, numerical data, or geospatial data,\nElasticsearch efficiently stores and indexes it in a way that supports fast searches.\n\nFor timestamped data such as logs and metrics, you typically add documents to a\ndata stream made up of multiple auto-generated backing indices.\n\nTo add a single document to an index, submit an HTTP post request that targets the index.\n\n----\nPOST /customer/_doc/1\n{\n  \"firstname\": \"Jennifer\",\n  \"lastname\": \"Walters\"\n}\n----\n\nThis request automatically creates the `customer` index if it doesn't exist,\nadds a new document that has an ID of 1, and\nstores and indexes the `firstname` and `lastname` fields.\n\nThe new document is available immediately from any node in the cluster.\nYou can retrieve it with a GET request that specifies its document ID:\n\n----\nGET /customer/_doc/1\n----\n\nTo add multiple documents in one request, use the `_bulk` API.\nBulk data must be newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON).\nEach line must end in a newline character (`\\n`), including the last line.\n\n----\nPUT customer/_bulk\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Monica\",\"lastname\":\"Rambeau\"}\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Carol\",\"lastname\":\"Danvers\"}\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Wanda\",\"lastname\":\"Maximoff\"}\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Jennifer\",\"lastname\":\"Takeda\"}\n----\n\n**Search**\n\nIndexed documents are available for search in near real-time.\nThe following search matches all customers with a first name of _Jennifer_\nin the `customer` index.\n\n----\nGET customer/_search\n{\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"match\" : { \"firstname\": \"Jennifer\" }\n  }\n}\n----\n\n**Explore**\n\nYou can use Discover in Kibana to interactively search and filter your data.\nFrom there, you can start creating visualizations and building and sharing dashboards.\n\nTo get started, create a _data view_ that connects to one or more Elasticsearch indices,\ndata streams, or index aliases.\n\n. Go to **Management > Stack Management > Kibana > Data Views**.\n. Select **Create data view**.\n. Enter a name for the data view and a pattern that matches one or more indices,\nsuch as _customer_.\n. Select **Save data view to Kibana**.\n\nTo start exploring, go to **Analytics > Discover**.\n\n[[upgrade]]\n== Upgrade\n\nTo upgrade from an earlier version of Elasticsearch, see the\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html[Elasticsearch upgrade\ndocumentation].\n\n[[build-source]]\n== Build from source\n\nElasticsearch uses https://gradle.org[Gradle] for its build system.\n\nTo build a distribution for your local OS and print its output location upon\ncompletion, run:\n----\n./gradlew localDistro\n----\n\nTo build a distribution for another platform, run the related command:\n----\n./gradlew :distribution:archives:linux-tar:assemble\n./gradlew :distribution:archives:darwin-tar:assemble\n./gradlew :distribution:archives:windows-zip:assemble\n----\n\nDistributions are output to `distribution/archives`.\n\nTo run the test suite, see xref:TESTING.asciidoc[TESTING].\n\n[[docs]]\n== Documentation\n\nFor the complete Elasticsearch documentation visit\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html[elastic.co].\n\nFor information about our documentation processes, see the\nxref:https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/docs/README.md[docs README].\n\n[[examples]]\n== Examples and guides\n\nThe https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs[`elasticsearch-labs`] repo contains executable Python notebooks, sample apps, and resources to test out Elasticsearch for vector search, hybrid search and generative AI use cases.\n\n\n[[contribute]]\n== Contribute\n\nFor contribution guidelines, see xref:CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING].\n\n[[questions]]\n== Questions?

Just drop it into any project and compile it as you would compile other files.\nTo configure LVGL, copy `lv_conf_template.h` as `lv_conf.h`, enable the first `#if 0`, and adjust the configs as needed.\n(The default config is usually fine.) If available, LVGL can also be used with Kconfig.\n\nOnce in the project, you can initialize LVGL and create display and input devices as follows:\n\n```c\n#include \"lvgl/lvgl.h\" /*Define LV_LVGL_H_INCLUDE_SIMPLE to include as \"lvgl.h\"*/\n\n#define TFT_HOR_RES 320\n#define TFT_VER_RES 240\n\nstatic uint32_t my_tick_cb(void)\n{\n    return my_get_millisec();\n}\n\nstatic void my_flush_cb(lv_display_t * disp, const lv_area_t * area, uint8_t * px_map)\n{\n    /*Write px_map to the area->x1, area->x2, area->y1, area->y2 area of the\n     *frame buffer or external display controller. */\n}\n\nstatic void my_touch_read_cb(lv_indev_t * indev, lv_indev_data_t * data)\n{\n   if(my_touch_is_pressed()) {\n       data->point.x = touchpad_x;\n       data->point.y = touchpad_y;\n       data->state = LV_INDEV_STATE_PRESSED;\n   } else {\n       data->state = LV_INDEV_STATE_RELEASED;\n   }\n}\n\nvoid main(void)\n{\n    my_hardware_init();\n\n    /*Initialize LVGL*/\n    lv_init();\n\n    /*Set millisecond-based tick source for LVGL so that it can track time.*/\n    lv_tick_set_cb(my_tick_cb);\n\n    /*Create a display where screens and widgets can be added*/\n    lv_display_t * display = lv_display_create(TFT_HOR_RES, TFT_VER_RES);\n\n    /*Add rendering buffers to the screen.\n     *Here adding a smaller partial buffer assuming 16-bit (RGB565 color format)*/\n    static uint8_t buf[TFT_HOR_RES * TFT_VER_RES / 10 * 2]; /* x2 because of 16-bit color depth */\n    lv_display_set_buffers(display, buf, NULL, sizeof(buf), LV_DISPLAY_RENDER_MODE_PARTIAL);\n\n    /*Add a callback that can flush the content from `buf` when it has been rendered*/\n    lv_display_set_flush_cb(display, my_flush_cb);\n\n    /*Create an input device for touch handling*/\n    lv_indev_t * indev = lv_indev_create();\n    lv_indev_set_type(indev, LV_INDEV_TYPE_POINTER);\n    lv_indev_set_read_cb(indev, my_touch_read_cb);\n\n    /*The drivers are in place;

(By default it\nconverts to `std::print`.)\n\n# Notable projects using this library\n\n- [0 A.D.](https://play0ad.com/): a free, open-source, cross-platform\n  real-time strategy game\n-

Motivation\n\nSo why yet another formatting library?\n\nThere are plenty of methods for doing this task, from standard ones like\nthe printf family of function and iostreams to Boost Format and\nFastFormat libraries. The reason for creating a new library is that\nevery existing solution that I found either had serious issues or\ndidn\\'t provide all the features I needed.\n\n## printf\n\nThe good thing about `printf` is that it is pretty fast and readily\navailable being a part of the C standard library. The main drawback is\nthat it doesn\\'t support user-defined types. `printf` also has safety\nissues although they are somewhat mitigated with [\\_\\_attribute\\_\\_\n((format (printf,\n\\...))](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html) in\nGCC. There is a POSIX extension that adds positional arguments required\nfor\n[i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)\nto `printf` but it is not a part of C99 and may not be available on some\nplatforms.\n\n## iostreams\n\nThe main issue with iostreams is best illustrated with an example:\n\n``` c++\nstd::cout << std::setprecision(2) << std::fixed << 1.23456 << \"\\n\";\n```\n\nwhich is a lot of typing compared to printf:\n\n``` c++\nprintf(\"%.2f\\n\", 1.23456);\n```\n\nMatthew Wilson, the author of FastFormat, called this \\\"chevron hell\\\".\niostreams don\\'t support positional arguments by design.\n\nThe good part is that iostreams support user-defined types and are safe\nalthough error handling is awkward.\n\n## Boost Format\n\nThis is a very powerful library that supports both `printf`-like format\nstrings and positional arguments. Its main drawback is performance.\nAccording to various benchmarks, it is much slower than other methods\nconsidered here. Boost Format also has excessive build times and severe\ncode bloat issues (see [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)).\n\n## FastFormat\n\nThis is an interesting library that is fast, safe and has positional\narguments. However, it has significant limitations, citing its author:\n\n> Three features that have no hope of being accommodated within the\n> current design are:\n>\n> - Leading zeros (or any other non-space padding)\n> - Octal/hexadecimal encoding\n> - Runtime width/alignment specification\n\nIt is also quite big and has a heavy dependency, on STLSoft, which might be\ntoo restrictive for use in some projects.\n\n## Boost Spirit.Karma\n\nThis is not a formatting library but I decided to include it here for\ncompleteness. As iostreams, it suffers from the problem of mixing\nverbatim text with arguments. The library is pretty fast, but slower on\ninteger formatting than `fmt::format_to` with format string compilation\non Karma\\'s own benchmark, see [Converting a hundred million integers to\nstrings per\nsecond](http://www.zverovich.net/2020/06/13/fast-int-to-string-revisited.html).\n\n# License\n\n{fmt} is distributed under the MIT\n[license](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n# Documentation License\n\nThe [Format String Syntax](https://fmt.dev/latest/syntax/) section\nin the documentation is based on the one from Python [string module\ndocumentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#module-string).\nFor this reason, the documentation is distributed under the Python\nSoftware Foundation license available in\n[doc/python-license.txt](https://raw.github.com/fmtlib/fmt/master/doc/python-license.txt).\nIt only applies if you distribute the documentation of {fmt}.\n\n# Maintainers\n\nThe {fmt} library is maintained by Victor Zverovich\n([vitaut](https://github.com/vitaut)) with contributions from many other\npeople.

      "readme": "# Introduction\n\n`DocumentDB` is a MongoDB compatible open source document database built on PostgreSQL. It offers a native implementation of a document-oriented NoSQL database, enabling seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on BSON(Binary JSON) data types within a PostgreSQL framework. Beyond basic operations, DocumentDB empowers users to execute complex workloads, including full-text searches, geospatial queries, and vector search, delivering robust functionality and flexibility for diverse data management needs.\n\n[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.\n\n## Components\n\nThe project comprises of three components, which work together to support document operations.\n\n- **pg_documentdb_core :** PostgreSQL extension introducing BSON datatype support and operations for native Postgres.\n- **pg_documentdb :** The public API surface for DocumentDB providing CRUD functionality on documents in the store.\n- **pg_documentdb_gw :** The gateway protocol translation layer that converts the user's MongoDB APIs into PostgreSQL queries.\n\n## Why DocumentDB ?\n\nAt DocumentDB, we believe in the power of open-source to drive innovation and collaboration. Our commitment to being a fully open-source MongoDB compatible document database means that we are dedicated to transparency, community involvement, and continuous improvement. We are open-sourced under the most permissive [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit) license, where developers and organizations alike have no restrictions incorporating the project into new and existing solutions of their own. DocumentDB introduces the BSON data type to PostgreSQL and provides APIs for seamless operation within native PostgreSQL, enhancing efficiency and aligning with operational advantages.\n\nDocumentDB also provides a powerful on-premise solution, allowing organizations to maintain full control over their data and infrastructure. This flexibility ensures that you can deploy it in your own environment, meeting your specific security, compliance, and performance requirements. With DocumentDB, you get the best of both worlds: the innovation of open-source and the control of on-premise deployment.\n\n### Based on Postgres\n\nWe chose PostgreSQL as our platform for several reasons:\n\n1. **Proven Stability and Performance**: PostgreSQL has a long history of stability and performance, making it a trusted choice for mission-critical applications.\n2. **Extensibility**: The extensible architecture of PostgreSQL allows us to integrate a DocumentDB API on BSON data type seamlessly, providing the flexibility to handle both relational and document data.\n3. **Active Community**: PostgreSQL has a vibrant and active community that continuously contributes to its development, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of database technology.\n4. **Advanced Features**: PostgreSQL offers a rich feature set, including advanced indexing, full-text search, and powerful querying capabilities, which enhance the functionality of DocumentDB.\n5. **Compliance and Security**: PostgreSQL's robust security features and compliance with various standards makes it an ideal choice for organizations with stringent security and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Get Started\n\n[Building From Source](/docs/v1/building.md)\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Python 3.7+\n- pip package manager\n- Docker\n- Git (for cloning the repository)\n\nStep 1: Install Python\n\n```bash\n\npip install pymongo\n\n```\n\nStep 2. Install optional dependencies\n\n```bash\n\npip install dnspython\n\n```\n\nStep 3. Setup DocumentDB using Docker\n\n```bash\n\n   # Pull the latest DocumentDB Docker image\n   docker pull ghcr.io/documentdb/documentdb/documentdb-local:latest\n\n   # Tag the image for convenience\n   docker tag ghcr.io/documentdb/documentdb/documentdb-local:latest documentdb\n\n   # Run the container with your chosen username and password\n   docker run -dt -p 10260:10260 --name documentdb-container documentdb --username <YOUR_USERNAME> --password <YOUR_PASSWORD>\n   docker image rm -f ghcr.io/documentdb/documentdb/documentdb-local:latest || echo \"No existing documentdb image to remove\"\n\n```\n\n   > **Note:** Replace `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_PASSWORD>` with your desired credentials. You must set these when creating the container for authentication to work.\n   > \n   > **Port Note:** Port `10260` is used by default in these instructions to avoid conflicts with other local database services. You can use port `27017` (the standard MongoDB port) or any other available port if you prefer. If you do, be sure to update the port number in both your `docker run` command and your connection string accordingly.\n\nStep 4: Initialize the pymongo client with the credentials from the previous step\n\n```python\n\nimport pymongo\n\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n# Create a MongoDB client and open a connection to DocumentDB\nclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\n    'mongodb://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<YOUR_PASSWORD>@localhost:10260/?tls=true&tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=true'\n)\n\n```\n\nStep 5: Create a database and collection\n\n```python\n\nquickStartDatabase = client[\"quickStartDatabase\"]\nquickStartCollection = quickStartDatabase.create_collection(\"quickStartCollection\")\n\n```\n\nStep 6: Insert documents\n\n```python\n\n# Insert a single document\nquickStartCollection.insert_one({\n       'name': 'John Doe',\n       'email': 'john@email.com',\n       'address': '123 Main St, Anytown, USA',\n       'phone': '555-1234'\n   })\n\n# Insert multiple documents\nquickStartCollection.insert_many([\n    {\n        'name': 'Jane Smith',\n        'email': 'jane@email.com',\n        'address': '456 Elm St, Othertown, USA',\n        'phone': '555-5678'\n    },\n    {\n        'name': 'Alice Johnson',\n        'email': 'alice@email.com',\n        'address': '789 Oak St, Sometown, USA',\n        'phone': '555-8765'\n    }\n])\n\n```\n\nStep 7: Read documents\n\n```python\n\n# Read all documents\nfor document in quickStartCollection.find():\n    print(document)\n\n# Read a specific document\nsingleDocumentReadResult = quickStartCollection.find_one({'name': 'John Doe'})\nprint(singleDocumentReadResult)\n\n```\n\nStep 8: Run aggregation pipeline operation\n\n```python\n\npipeline = [\n    {'$match': {'name': 'Alice Johnson'}},\n    {'$project': {\n        '_id': 0,\n        'name': 1,\n        'email': 1\n    }}\n]\n\nresults = quickStartCollection.aggregate(pipeline)\nprint(\"Aggregation results:\")\nfor eachDocument in results:\n    print(eachDocument)\n\n```\n\n### Helpful Links\n\n- Check out our [website](https://documentdb.io) to stay up to date with the latest on the project.\n- Check out our [docs](https://documentdb.io/docs) for MongoDB API compatibility, quickstarts and more.\n- Contributors and users can join the [DocumentDB Discord channel](https://discord.gg/vH7bYu524D) for quick collaboration.\n- Check out [FerretDB](https://github.com/FerretDB/FerretDB) and their integration of DocumentDB as a backend engine.\n",

Check out our [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2025/09/compose-multiplatform-1-9-0-compose-for-web-beta/) to learn more about the progress made to reach this milestone.\n> We would appreciate your feedback on it in the public Slack channel [#compose-web](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C01F2HV7868/p1678887590205449). \n> If you face any issues, please report them on [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=CMP).\n\nYou can experiment with sharing your mobile or desktop UIs with the web. Compose Multiplatform for web is based on [Kotlin/Wasm](https://kotl.in/wasm), \nthe newest target for Kotlin Multiplatform projects. It allows Kotlin developers to run their code in the browser with \nall the benefits that WebAssembly has to offer, such as good and predictable performance for your applications.\n\n**[Get started with Compose Multiplatform for web](https://jb.gg/start-cmp)**\n\n## Libraries\n\n### Compose HTML\n\nCompose HTML is a library targeting [Kotlin/JS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-overview.html) that provides Composable building blocks \nfor creating web user interfaces with HTML and CSS.    \n\n> Note that Compose HTML is not a multiplatform library. It can be used only with Kotlin/JS.\n\n## Learn more\n\n* [FAQ](https://jb.gg/cmp-faq)\n* [Samples](https://jb.gg/cmp-samples)\n* [Tutorials](tutorials/README.md)\n* [Compatibility and versioning](https://jb.gg/cmp-versioning)\n* [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\n* [Contibution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Get help\n\nThere are dedicated public Slack channels for [#compose-ios](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C0346LWVBJ4/p1678888063176359), [#compose-desktop](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C01D6HTPATV) and [#compose-web](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C01F2HV7868/p1678887590205449), as well as the general [#compose](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/CJLTWPH7S) channel.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=CMP).\n\n",

It is capable of protecting workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized, and cloud-based environments.\n\nWazuh solution consists of an endpoint security agent, deployed to the monitored systems, and a management server, which collects and analyzes data gathered by the agents. Besides, Wazuh has been fully integrated with the Elastic Stack, providing a search engine and data visualization tool that allows users to navigate through their security alerts.\n\n## Wazuh capabilities\n\nA brief presentation of some of the more common use cases of the Wazuh solution.\n\n**Intrusion detection**\n\nWazuh agents scan the monitored systems looking for malware, rootkits and suspicious anomalies. They can detect hidden files, cloaked processes or unregistered network listeners, as well as inconsistencies in system call responses.\n\nIn addition to agent capabilities, the server component uses a signature-based approach to intrusion detection, using its regular expression engine to analyze collected log data and look for indicators of compromise.\n\n**Log data analysis**\n\nWazuh agents read operating system and application logs, and securely forward them to a central manager for rule-based analysis and storage. When no agent is deployed, the server can also receive data via syslog from network devices or applications.\n\nThe Wazuh rules help make you aware of application or system errors, misconfigurations, attempted and/or successful malicious activities, policy violations and a variety of other security and operational issues.\n\n**File integrity monitoring**\n\nWazuh monitors the file system, identifying changes in content, permissions, ownership, and attributes of files that you need to keep an eye on. In addition, it natively identifies users and applications used to create or modify files.\n\nFile integrity monitoring capabilities can be used in combination with threat intelligence to identify threats or compromised hosts. In addition, several regulatory compliance standards, such as PCI DSS, require it.\n\n**Vulnerability detection**\n\nWazuh agents pull software inventory data and send this information to the server, where it is correlated with continuously updated CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure) databases, in order to identify well-known vulnerable software.\n\nAutomated vulnerability assessment helps you find the weak spots in your critical assets and take corrective action before attackers exploit them to sabotage your business or steal confidential data.\n\n**Configuration assessment**\n\nWazuh monitors system and application configuration settings to ensure they are compliant with your security policies, standards and/or hardening guides. Agents perform periodic scans to detect applications that are known to be vulnerable, unpatched, or insecurely configured.\n\nAdditionally, configuration checks can be customized, tailoring them to properly align with your organization. Alerts include recommendations for better configuration, references and mapping with regulatory compliance.\n\n**Incident response**\n\nWazuh provides out-of-the-box active responses to perform various countermeasures to address active threats, such as blocking access to a system from the threat source when certain criteria are met.\n\nIn addition, Wazuh can be used to remotely run commands or system queries, identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) and helping perform other live forensics or incident response tasks.\n\n**Regulatory compliance**\n\nWazuh provides some of the necessary security controls to become compliant with industry standards and regulations. These features, combined with its scalability and multi-platform support help organizations meet technical compliance requirements.\n\nWazuh is widely used by payment processing companies and financial institutions to meet PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) requirements. Its web user interface provides reports and dashboards that can help with this and other regulations (e.g. GPG13 or GDPR).\n\n**Cloud security**\n\nWazuh helps monitoring cloud infrastructure at an API level, using integration modules that are able to pull security data from well known cloud providers, such as Amazon AWS, Azure or Google Cloud. In addition, Wazuh provides rules to assess the configuration of your cloud environment, easily spotting weaknesses.\n\nIn addition, Wazuh light-weight and multi-platform agents are commonly used to monitor cloud environments at the instance level.\n\n**Containers security**\n\nWazuh provides security visibility into your Docker hosts and containers, monitoring their behavior and detecting threats, vulnerabilities and anomalies. The Wazuh agent has native integration with the Docker engine allowing users to monitor images, volumes, network settings, and running containers.\n\nWazuh continuously collects and analyzes detailed runtime information. For example, alerting for containers running in privileged mode, vulnerable applications, a shell running in a container, changes to persistent volumes or images, and other possible threats.\n\n## WUI\n\nThe Wazuh WUI provides a powerful user interface for data visualization and analysis. This interface can also be used to manage Wazuh configuration and to monitor its status.\n\n**Modules overview**\n\n![Modules overview](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-dashboard-plugins/raw/main/screenshots/app.png)\n\n**Security events**\n\n![Overview](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-dashboard-plugins/blob/main/screenshots/app2.png)\n\n**Integrity monitoring**\n\n![Overview](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-dashboard-plugins/blob/main/screenshots/app3.png)\n\n**Vulnerability detection**\n\n![Overview](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-dashboard-plugins/blob/main/screenshots/app4.png)\n\n**Regulatory compliance**\n\n![Overview](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-dashboard-plugins/blob/main/screenshots/app5.png)\n\n**Agents overview**\n\n![Overview](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-dashboard-plugins/blob/main/screenshots/app6.png)\n\n**Agent summary**\n\n![Overview](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-dashboard-plugins/blob/main/screenshots/app7.png)\n\n## Orchestration\n\nHere you can find all the automation tools maintained by the Wazuh team.\n\n* [Wazuh AWS CloudFormation](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-cloudformation)\n\n* [Docker containers](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker)\n\n* [Wazuh Ansible](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-ansible)\n\n* [Wazuh Chef](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-chef)\n\n* [Wazuh Puppet](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-puppet)\n\n* [Wazuh Kubernetes](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kubernetes)\n\n* [Wazuh Bosh](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-bosh)\n\n* [Wazuh Salt](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-salt)\n\n## Branches\n\n* `main` branch contains the latest code, be aware of possible bugs on this branch.\n\n## Software and libraries used\n\n|Software|Version|Author|License|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|[bpftool](https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool)|7.5.0|libbpf|GNU Public License version 2|\n|[bzip2](https://github.com/libarchive/bzip2)|1.0.8|Julian Seward|BSD License|\n|[cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON)|1.7.18|Dave Gamble|MIT License|\n|[cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib)|0.25.0|yhirose|MIT License|\n|[cPython](https://github.com/python/cpython)|3.10.19|Guido van Rossum|Python Software Foundation License version 2|\n|[cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl)|8.12.1|Daniel Stenberg|MIT License|\n|[dbus](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus)|1.14.10|freedesktop.org|GNU Public License version 2|\n|[Flatbuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/)|23.5.26|Google Inc.|Apache 2.0 License|\n|[Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)|1.6.1|Google Inc.|Apache 2.0 License||\n|[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)|1.11.0|Google Inc.|3-Clause \"New\" BSD License|\n|[jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc)|5.2.1|Jason Evans|2-Clause \"Simplified\" BSD License|\n|[libarchive](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive)|3.8.1|Tim Kientzle|3-Clause \"New\" BSD License|\n|[libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf)|1.5.0|libbpf|GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1|\n|[libdb](https://github.com/yasuhirokimura/db18)|18.1.40|Oracle Corporation|Affero GPL v3|\n|[libffi](https://github.com/libffi/libffi)|3.2.1|Anthony Green|MIT License|\n|[libpcre2](https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2)|10.42.0|Philip Hazel|BSD License|\n|[libplist](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libplist)|2.2.0|Aaron Burghardt et al.|GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1|\n|[libYAML](https://github.com/yaml/libyaml)|0.1.7|Kirill Simonov|MIT License|\n|[liblzma](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)|5.4.2|Lasse Collin, Jia Tan et al.|GNU Public License version 3|\n|[Linux Audit userspace](https://github.com/linux-audit/audit-userspace)|2.8.4|Rik Faith|GNU Lesser General Public License|\n|[Lua](https://github.com/lua/lua)|5.4.8|PUC-Rio|MIT License|\n|[msgpack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c)|3.1.1|Sadayuki Furuhashi|Boost Software License version 1.0|\n|[nlohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)|3.11.2|Niels Lohmann|MIT License|\n|[OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)|3.5.1|OpenSSL Software Foundation|Apache 2.0 License|\n|[pacman](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman)|5.2.2|Judd Vinet|GNU Public License version 2|\n|[popt](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/popt)|1.16|Jeff Johnson & Erik Troan|MIT License|\n|[procps](https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps)|2.8.3|Brian Edmonds et al.|GNU Lesser General Public License|\n|[RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/)|8.3.2|Facebook Inc.|Apache 2.0 License|\n|[rpm](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm)|4.20.1|Marc Ewing & Erik Troan|GNU Public License version 2|\n|[simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson)|3.13.0|Daniel Lemire|Apache License 2.0|\n|[sqlite](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite)|3.50.4|D.

For native builds, please install the [prerequisite](#prerequisites) _System Packages_.\n\n1. #### Generate the TensorRT-OSS build container.\n\n   **Example: Ubuntu 24.04 on x86-64 with cuda-13.0 (default)**\n\n   ```bash\n   ./docker/build.sh --file docker/ubuntu-24.04.Dockerfile --tag tensorrt-ubuntu24.04-cuda13.0\n   ```\n\n   **Example: Rockylinux8 on x86-64 with cuda-13.0**\n\n   ```bash\n   ./docker/build.sh --file docker/rockylinux8.Dockerfile --tag tensorrt-rockylinux8-cuda13.0\n   ```\n\n   **Example: Ubuntu 24.04 cross-compile for Jetson (aarch64) with cuda-13.0 (JetPack SDK)**\n\n   ```bash\n   ./docker/build.sh --file docker/ubuntu-cross-aarch64.Dockerfile --tag tensorrt-jetpack-cuda13.0\n   ```\n\n   **Example: Ubuntu 24.04 on aarch64 with cuda-13.0**\n\n   ```bash\n   ./docker/build.sh --file docker/ubuntu-24.04-aarch64.Dockerfile --tag tensorrt-aarch64-ubuntu24.04-cuda13.0\n   ```\n\n2. #### Launch the TensorRT-OSS build container.\n   **Example: Ubuntu 24.04 build container**\n   ```bash\n   ./docker/launch.sh --tag tensorrt-ubuntu24.04-cuda13.0 --gpus all\n   ```\n   > NOTE:\n   > <br> 1. Use the `--tag` corresponding to build container generated in Step 1.\n   > <br> 2. [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](#prerequisites) is required for GPU access (running TensorRT applications) inside the build container.\n   > <br> 3. `sudo` password for Ubuntu build containers is 'nvidia'.\n   > <br> 4. Specify port number using `--jupyter <port>` for launching Jupyter notebooks.\n   > <br> 5. Write permission to this folder is required as this folder will be mounted inside the docker container for uid:gid of 1000:1000.\n\n## Building TensorRT-OSS\n\n- Generate Makefiles and build\n\n  **Example: Linux (x86-64) build with default cuda-13.0**\n\n  ```bash\n  cd $TRT_OSSPATH\n  mkdir -p build && cd build\n  cmake .. -DTRT_LIB_DIR=$TRT_LIBPATH -DTRT_OUT_DIR=`pwd`/out\n  make -j$(nproc)\n  ```\n\n  **Example: Linux (aarch64) build with default cuda-13.0**\n\n  ```bash\n  cd $TRT_OSSPATH\n  mkdir -p build && cd build\n  cmake .. -DTRT_LIB_DIR=$TRT_LIBPATH -DTRT_OUT_DIR=`pwd`/out -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$TRT_OSSPATH/cmake/toolchains/cmake_aarch64-native.toolchain\n  make -j$(nproc)\n  ```\n\n  **Example: Native build on Jetson Thor (aarch64) with cuda-13.0**\n\n  ```bash\n  cd $TRT_OSSPATH\n  mkdir -p build && cd build\n  cmake .. -DTRT_LIB_DIR=$TRT_LIBPATH -DTRT_OUT_DIR=`pwd`/out -DTRT_PLATFORM_ID=aarch64\n  CC=/usr/bin/gcc make -j$(nproc)\n  ```\n\n  > NOTE: C compiler must be explicitly specified via CC= for native aarch64 builds of protobuf.\n\n  **Example: Ubuntu 24.04 Cross-Compile for Jetson Thor (aarch64) with cuda-13.0 (JetPack)**\n\n  ```bash\n  cd $TRT_OSSPATH\n  mkdir -p build && cd build\n  cmake .. -DTRT_LIB_DIR=$TRT_LIBPATH -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$TRT_OSSPATH/cmake/toolchains/cmake_aarch64_cross.toolchain\n  make -j$(nproc)\n  ```\n\n  **Example: Ubuntu 24.04 Cross-Compile for DriveOS (aarch64) with cuda-13.0**\n\n  ```bash\n  cd $TRT_OSSPATH\n  mkdir -p build && cd build\n  cmake .. -DTRT_LIB_DIR=$TRT_LIBPATH -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$TRT_OSSPATH/cmake/toolchains/cmake_aarch64_dos_cross.toolchain\n  make -j$(nproc)\n  ```\n\n  **Example: Native builds on Windows (x86) with cuda-13.0**\n\n  ```bash\n  cd $TRT_OSSPATH\n  mkdir -p build\n  cd -p build\n  cmake .. -DTRT_LIB_DIR=\"$env:TRT_LIBPATH\" -DTRT_OUT_DIR=\"$pwd\\\\out\"\n  msbuild TensorRT.sln /property:Configuration=Release -m:$env:NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS\n  ```\n\n  > NOTE: The default CUDA version used by CMake is 13.0. To override this, for example to 12.9, append `-DCUDA_VERSION=12.9` to the cmake command.\n\n- Required CMake build arguments are:\n  - `TRT_LIB_DIR`: Path to the TensorRT installation directory containing libraries.\n  - `TRT_OUT_DIR`: Output directory where generated build artifacts will be copied.\n- Optional CMake build arguments:\n  - `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: Specify if binaries generated are for release or debug (contain debug symbols). Values consists of [`Release`] | `Debug`\n  - `CUDA_VERSION`: The version of CUDA to target, for example [`12.9.9`].\n  - `CUDNN_VERSION`: The version of cuDNN to target, for example [`8.9`].\n  - `PROTOBUF_VERSION`: The version of Protobuf to use, for example [`3.20.1`]. Note: Changing this will not configure CMake to use a system version of Protobuf, it will configure CMake to download and try building that version.\n  - `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`: The path to a toolchain file for cross compilation.\n  - `BUILD_PARSERS`: Specify if the parsers should be built, for example [`ON`] | `OFF`. If turned OFF, CMake will try to find precompiled versions of the parser libraries to use in compiling samples. First in `${TRT_LIB_DIR}`, then on the system. If the build type is Debug, then it will prefer debug builds of the libraries before release versions if available.\n  - `BUILD_PLUGINS`: Specify if the plugins should be built, for example [`ON`] | `OFF`. If turned OFF, CMake will try to find a precompiled version of the plugin library to use in compiling samples. First in `${TRT_LIB_DIR}`, then on the system. If the build type is Debug, then it will prefer debug builds of the libraries before release versions if available.\n  - `BUILD_SAMPLES`: Specify if the samples should be built, for example [`ON`] | `OFF`.\n  - `GPU_ARCHS`: GPU (SM) architectures to target. By default we generate CUDA code for all major SMs. Specific SM versions can be specified here as a quoted space-separated list to reduce compilation time and binary size. Table of compute capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). Examples: - NVidia A100: `-DGPU_ARCHS=\"80\"` - RTX 50 series: `-DGPU_ARCHS=\"120\"` - Multiple SMs: `-DGPU_ARCHS=\"80 120\"`\n  - `TRT_PLATFORM_ID`: Bare-metal build (unlike containerized cross-compilation). Currently supported options: `x86_64` (default).\n\n# References\n\n## TensorRT Resources\n\n- [TensorRT Developer Home](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)\n- [TensorRT QuickStart Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/quick-start-guide/index.html)\n- [TensorRT Developer Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/developer-guide/index.html)\n- [TensorRT Sample Support Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/sample-support-guide/index.html)\n- [TensorRT ONNX Tools](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/index.html#tools)\n- [TensorRT Discussion Forums](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/board/304/tensorrt/)\n- [TensorRT Release Notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/release-notes/index.html)\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- Please refer to [TensorRT Release Notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/release-notes)\n",

We have a Bash launcher script at [bin/utils/openapi-generator.cli.sh](./bin/utils/openapi-generator-cli.sh) which resolves this issue.\n\nTo install the launcher script, copy the contents of the script to a location on your path and make the script executable.\n\nAn example of setting this up (NOTE: Always evaluate scripts curled from external systems before executing them).\n\n```\nmkdir -p ~/bin/openapitools\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/bin/utils/openapi-generator-cli.sh > ~/bin/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli\nchmod u+x ~/bin/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/bin/openapitools/\n```\n\nNow, `openapi-generator-cli` is \"installed\". On invocation, it will query the GitHub repository for the most recently released version. If this matches the last downloaded jar,\nit will execute as normal. If a newer version is found, the script will download the latest release and execute it.\n\nIf you need to invoke an older version of the generator, you can define the variable `OPENAPI_GENERATOR_VERSION` either ad hoc or globally. You can export this variable if you'd like to persist a specific release version.\n\nExamples:\n\n```\n# Execute latest released openapi-generator-cli\nopenapi-generator-cli version\n\n# Execute version 4.1.0 for the current invocation, regardless of the latest released version\nOPENAPI_GENERATOR_VERSION=4.1.0 openapi-generator-cli version\n\n# Execute version 4.1.0-SNAPSHOT for the current invocation\nOPENAPI_GENERATOR_VERSION=4.1.0-SNAPSHOT openapi-generator-cli version\n\n# Execute version 4.0.2 for every invocation in the current shell session\nexport OPENAPI_GENERATOR_VERSION=4.0.2\nopenapi-generator-cli version # is 4.0.2\nopenapi-generator-cli version # is also 4.0.2\n\n# To \"install\" a specific version, set the variable in .bashrc/.bash_profile\necho \"export OPENAPI_GENERATOR_VERSION=4.0.2\" >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\nopenapi-generator-cli version # is always 4.0.2, unless any of the above overrides are done ad hoc\n```\n\n### [1.4 - Build Projects](#table-of-contents)\n\nTo build from source, you need the following installed and available in your `$PATH:`\n\n* [Java 11](https://adoptium.net/)\n\n* [Apache Maven 3.8.8 or greater](https://maven.apache.org/) (optional)\n\nAfter cloning the project, you can build it from source using [maven wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/):\n\n- Linux: `./mvnw clean install`\n- Windows: `mvnw.cmd clean install`\n\n#### Nix users\n\nIf you're a nix user, you can enter OpenAPI Generator shell, by typing:\n```sh\nnix develop\n```\nIt will enter a shell with Java 11 installed.\n\nDirenv supports automatically loading of the nix developer shell, so if you're using direnv too, type:\n```sh\ndirenv allow\n```\nand have `java` and `mvn` set up with correct versions each time you enter project directory.\n\nThe default build contains minimal static analysis (via CheckStyle). To run your build with PMD and Spotbugs, use the `static-analysis` profile:\n\n- Linux: `./mvnw -Pstatic-analysis clean install`\n- Windows: `mvnw.cmd -Pstatic-analysis clean install`\n\n### [1.5 - Homebrew](#table-of-contents)\n\nTo install, run `brew install openapi-generator`\n\nHere is an example usage to generate a Ruby client:\n```sh\nopenapi-generator generate -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml -g ruby -o /tmp/test/\n```\n\nTo reinstall with the latest master, run `brew uninstall openapi-generator && brew install --HEAD openapi-generator`\n\nTo install OpenJDK (pre-requisites), please run\n```sh\nbrew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk\nbrew install --cask adoptopenjdk11\nexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.11`\n```\n\nor download installer via https://adoptium.net/\n\nTo install Maven (optional), please run\n```sh\nbrew install maven\n```\n\n### [1.6 - Docker](#table-of-contents)\n\n#### Public Pre-built Docker images\n\n - [https://hub.docker.com/r/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/](https://hub.docker.com/r/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/) (official CLI)\n - [https://hub.docker.com/r/openapitools/openapi-generator-online/](https://hub.docker.com/r/openapitools/openapi-generator-online/) (official web service)\n\n\n#### OpenAPI Generator CLI Docker Image\n\nThe OpenAPI Generator image acts as a standalone executable. It can be used as an alternative to installing via homebrew, or for developers who are unable to install Java or upgrade the installed version.\n\nTo generate code with this image, you'll need to mount a local location as a volume.\n\nExample:\n\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -v \"${PWD}:/local\" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \\\n    -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml \\\n    -g go \\\n    -o /local/out/go\n```\n\nThe generated code will be located under `./out/go` in the current directory.\n\n#### OpenAPI Generator Online Docker Image\n\nThe openapi-generator-online image can act as a self-hosted web application and API for generating code. This container can be incorporated into a CI pipeline, and requires at least two HTTP requests and some docker orchestration to access generated code.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```sh\n# Start container at port 8888 and save the container id\n> CID=$(docker run -d -p 8888:8080 openapitools/openapi-generator-online)\n\n# allow for startup\n> sleep 10\n\n# Get the IP of the running container (optional)\nGEN_IP=$(docker inspect --format '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}'  $CID)\n\n# Execute an HTTP request to generate a Ruby client\n> curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' \\\n-d '{\"openAPIUrl\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openapitools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml\"}' \\\n'http://localhost:8888/api/gen/clients/ruby'\n\n{\"code\":\"c2d483.3.4672-40e9-91df-b9ffd18d22b8\",\"link\":\"http://localhost:8888/api/gen/download/c2d483.3.4672-40e9-91df-b9ffd18d22b8\"}\n\n# Download the generated zip file\n> wget http://localhost:8888/api/gen/download/c2d483.3.4672-40e9-91df-b9ffd18d22b8\n\n# Unzip the file\n> unzip c2d483.3.4672-40e9-91df-b9ffd18d22b8\n\n# Shutdown the openapi generator image\n> docker stop $CID && docker rm $CID\n```\n\n#### Development in docker\n\nYou can use `run-in-docker.sh` to do all development. This script maps your local repository to `/gen`\nin the docker container. It also maps `~/.m2/repository` to the appropriate container location.\n\nTo execute `mvn package`:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator\ncd openapi-generator\n./run-in-docker.sh mvn package\n```\n\nBuild artifacts are now accessible in your working directory.\n\nOnce built, `run-in-docker.sh` will act as an executable for openapi-generator-cli. To generate code, you'll need to output to a directory under `/gen` (e.g. `/gen/out`). For example:\n\n```sh\n./run-in-docker.sh help # Executes 'help' command for openapi-generator-cli\n./run-in-docker.sh list # Executes 'list' command for openapi-generator-cli\n./run-in-docker.sh generate -i modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml \\\n    -g go -o /gen/out/go-petstore -p packageName=petstore # generates go client, outputs locally to ./out/go-petstore\n```\n\n##### Troubleshooting\n\nIf an error like this occurs, just execute the **./mvnw clean install -U** command:\n\n> org.apache.maven.lifecycle.LifecycleExecutionException: Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.19.1:test (default-test) on project openapi-generator: A type incompatibility occurred while executing org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.19.1:test: java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError cannot be cast to java.io.IOException\n\n```sh\n./run-in-docker.sh ./mvnw clean install -U\n```\n\n> Failed to execute goal org.fortasoft:gradle-maven-plugin:1.0.8:invoke (default) on project openapi-generator-gradle-plugin-mvn-wrapper: org.gradle.tooling.BuildException: Could not execute build using Gradle distribution 'https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.7-bin.zip'\n\nRight now: no solution for this one :|\n\n#### Run Docker in Vagrant\nPrerequisite: install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).\n ```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator.git\ncd openapi-generator\nvagrant up\nvagrant ssh\ncd /vagrant\n./run-in-docker.sh ./mvnw package\n```\n\n### [1.7 - NPM](#table-of-contents)\n\nThere is also an [NPM package wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli) available for different platforms (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows). (JVM is still required)\nPlease see the [project's README](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli) there for more information.\n\nInstall it globally to get the CLI available on the command line:\n\n```sh\nnpm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g\nopenapi-generator-cli version\n```\n\n<!-- RELEASE_VERSION -->\nTo use a specific version of \"openapi-generator-cli\"\n\n```sh\nopenapi-generator-cli version-manager set 7.18.0\n```\n\nOr install it as dev-dependency:\n\n```sh\nnpm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -D\n```\n<!-- /RELEASE_VERSION -->\n\nYou can use [locally built JARs](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#use-locally-built-jar) or [`SNAPSHOT` versions](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#use-nightly-snapshot-build) as well.\n\n### [1.8 - pip](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n> **Platform(s)**: Linux, macOS, Windows\n**Install** via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (`java` executable is needed to run):\n\n```\npip install openapi-generator-cli\n```\n\nTo install a specific version\n```\npip install openapi-generator-cli==7.18.0\n```\n\nYou can also install with [jdk4py](https://github.com/activeviam/jdk4py) instead of java binary.

[Optimizing API Integration in a Large React Application Using OpenAPI Generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B33pQnGQUI) by Stefano Marzo\n\n\n## [6 - About Us](#table-of-contents)\n\nWhat's the design philosophy or principle behind OpenAPI Generator?\n\nWe focus on developer experience. The generators should produce code, config, documentation, and more that are easily understandable and consumable by users. We focused on simple use cases to start with (bottom-up approach). Since then the project and the community have grown a lot: 600k weekly downloads via NPM CLI wrapper, 30M downloads via openapi-generator-cli docker image just to highlight a few. We've gradually supported more features (e.g. oneOf, anyOf introduced in OpenAPI 3.0) in various generators and we will continue this approach to deliver something based on our understanding of user demand and what they want, and continue to add support of new features introduced in OpenAPI specification (such as v3.1 and future versions of the OpenAPI specification).\n\n### [6.1 - OpenAPI Generator Core Team](#table-of-contents)\n\nOpenAPI Generator core team members are contributors who have been making significant contributions (review issues, fix bugs, make enhancements, etc) to the project on a regular basis.\n\n#### Core Team Members\n* [@wing328](https://github.com/wing328) (2015/07) [:heart:](https://www.patreon.com/wing328)\n* [@jimschubert](https://github.com/jimschubert) (2016/05) [:heart:](https://www.patreon.com/jimschubert)\n* [@cbornet](https://github.com/cbornet) (2016/05)\n* [@jmini](https://github.com/jmini) (2018/04)  [:heart:](https://www.patreon.com/jmini)\n* [@etherealjoy](https://github.com/etherealjoy) (2019/06)\n\n:heart: = Link to support the contributor directly\n\n#### Template Creator\n\n**NOTE**: Embedded templates are only supported in _Mustache_ format.

      "readme": "# jq\n\n`jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor akin to `sed`,`awk`,`grep`, and friends for JSON data. It's written in portable C and has zero runtime dependencies, allowing you to easily slice, filter, map, and transform structured data.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- **Official Documentation**: [jqlang.org](https://jqlang.org)\n- **Try jq Online**: [play.jqlang.org](https://play.jqlang.org)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prebuilt Binaries\n\nDownload the latest releases from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases).\n\n### Docker Image\n\nPull the [jq image](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/pkgs/container/jq) to start quickly with Docker.\n\n#### Run with Docker\n\n##### Example: Extracting the version from a `package.json` file\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -i ghcr.io/jqlang/jq:latest < package.json '.version'\n```\n\n##### Example: Extracting the version from a `package.json` file with a mounted volume\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -i -v \"$PWD:$PWD\" -w \"$PWD\" ghcr.io/jqlang/jq:latest '.version' package.json\n```\n\n### Building from source\n\n#### Dependencies\n\n- libtool\n- make\n- automake\n- autoconf\n\n#### Instructions\n\n```console\ngit submodule update --init    # if building from git to get oniguruma\nautoreconf -i                  # if building from git\n./configure --with-oniguruma=builtin\nmake clean                     # if upgrading from a version previously built from source\nmake -j8\nmake check\nsudo make install\n```\n\nBuild a statically linked version:\n\n```console\nmake LDFLAGS=-all-static\n```\n\nIf you're not using the latest git version but instead building a released tarball (available on the release page), skip the `autoreconf` step, and flex or bison won't be needed.\n\n##### Cross-Compilation\n\nFor details on cross-compilation, check out the [GitHub Actions file](.github/workflows/ci.yml) and the [cross-compilation wiki page](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/wiki/Cross-compilation).\n\n## Community & Support\n\n- Questions & Help: [Stack Overflow (jq tag)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jq)\n- Chat & Community: [Join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/yg6yjNmgAC)\n- Wiki & Advanced Topics: [Explore the Wiki](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/wiki)\n\n## License\n\n`jq` is released under the [MIT License](COPYING). `jq`'s documentation is\nlicensed under the [Creative Commons CC BY 3.0](COPYING).\n`jq` uses parts of the open source C library \"decNumber\", which is distributed\nunder [ICU License](COPYING)\n",

Vector enables dramatic cost reduction, novel\ndata enrichment, and data security where you need it, not where it is most\nconvenient for your vendors. Additionally, it is open source and up to 10x\nfaster than every alternative in the space.\n\nTo get started, follow our [**quickstart guide**][docs.quickstart] or [**install\nVector**][docs.installation].\n\nVector is maintained by Datadog's [Community Open Source Engineering team](https://opensource.datadoghq.com/about/#the-community-open-source-engineering-team).\n\n### Principles\n\n* **Reliable** - Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector's primary design goal is reliability.\n* **End-to-end** - Deploys as an [agent][docs.roles#agent] or [aggregator][docs.roles#aggregator]. Vector is a complete platform.\n* **Unified** - [Logs][docs.data-model.log], [metrics][docs.data-model.metric] (beta), and traces (coming soon). One tool for all of your data.\n\n### Use cases\n\n* Reduce total observability costs.\n* Transition vendors without disrupting workflows.\n* Enhance data quality and improve insights.\n* Consolidate agents and eliminate agent fatigue.\n* Improve overall observability performance and reliability.\n\n### Community\n\n* Vector is relied on by startups and enterprises like **Atlassian**, **T-Mobile**,\n  **Comcast**, **Zendesk**, **Discord**, **Fastly**, **CVS**, **Trivago**,\n  **Tuple**, **Douban**, **Visa**, **Mambu**, **Blockfi**, **Claranet**,\n  **Instacart**, **Forcepoint**, and [many more][urls.production_users].\n* Vector is **downloaded over 100,000 times per day**.\n* Vector's largest user **processes over 500TB daily**.\n* Vector has **over 500 contributors** and growing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nAll user documentation is available at **[vector.dev/docs](https://vector.dev/docs)**.\n\nOther Resources:\n\n* [**Vector Calendar**][urls.vector_calendar]\n* **Policies**:\n  * [**Code of Conduct**][urls.vector_code_of_conduct]\n  * [**Contributing**][urls.vector_contributing_policy]\n  * [**Privacy**][urls.vector_privacy_policy]\n  * [**Releases**][urls.vector_releases_policy]\n  * [**Versioning**][urls.vector_versioning_policy]\n  * [**Security**][urls.vector_security_policy]\n\n## Comparisons\n\n### Performance\n\nThe following performance tests demonstrate baseline performance between\ncommon protocols with the exception of the Regex Parsing test.\n\n| Test

It can be used in \nSwiftUI, UIKit, and more, and on any Apple platform (iOS, macOS, iPadOS, visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS).\n\n* [What is the Composable Architecture?](#what-is-the-composable-architecture)\n* [Learn more](#learn-more)\n* [Examples](#examples)\n* [Basic usage](#basic-usage)\n* [Documentation](#documentation)\n* [FAQ](#faq)\n* [Community](#community)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Translations](#translations)\n\n## What is the Composable Architecture?\n\nThis library provides a few core tools that can be used to build applications of varying purpose and \ncomplexity. It provides compelling stories that you can follow to solve many problems you encounter \nday-to-day when building applications, such as:\n\n* **State management**\n  <br> How to manage the state of your application using simple value types, and share state across \n  many screens so that mutations in one screen can be immediately observed in another screen.\n\n* **Composition**\n  <br> How to break down large features into smaller components that can be extracted to their own, \n  isolated modules and be easily glued back together to form the feature.\n\n* **Side effects**\n  <br> How to let certain parts of the application talk to the outside world in the most testable \n  and understandable way possible.\n\n* **Testing**\n  <br> How to not only test a feature built in the architecture, but also write integration tests \n  for features that have been composed of many parts, and write end-to-end tests to understand how \n  side effects influence your application. This allows you to make strong guarantees that your \n  business logic is running in the way you expect.\n\n* **Ergonomics**\n  <br> How to accomplish all of the above in a simple API with as few concepts and moving parts as \n  possible.\n\n## Learn More\n\nThe Composable Architecture was designed over the course of many episodes on \n[Point-Free][pointfreeco], a video series exploring advanced programming topics in the Swift language, \nhosted by [Brandon Williams][mbrandonw] and [Stephen Celis][stephencelis].\n\nYou can watch all of the episodes [here][tca-episode-collection], as well as a dedicated, [multipart\ntour][tca-tour] of the architecture from scratch.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.pointfree.co/collections/tours/composable-architecture-1-0\">\n  <img alt=\"video poster image\" src=\"https://d3rccdn33rt8ze.cloudfront.net/episodes/0243.jpeg\" width=\"600\">\n</a>\n\n## Examples\n\n[![Screen shots of example applications](https://d3rccdn33rt8ze.cloudfront.net/composable-architecture/demos.png)](./Examples)\n\nThis repo comes with _lots_ of examples to demonstrate how to solve common and complex problems with \nthe Composable Architecture. Check out [this](./Examples) directory to see them all, including:\n\n* [Case Studies](./Examples/CaseStudies)\n  * Getting started\n  * Effects\n  * Navigation\n  * Higher-order reducers\n  * Reusable components\n* [Location manager](https://github.com/pointfreeco/composable-core-location/tree/main/Examples/LocationManager)\n* [Motion manager](https://github.com/pointfreeco/composable-core-motion/tree/main/Examples/MotionManager)\n* [Search](./Examples/Search)\n* [Speech Recognition](./Examples/SpeechRecognition)\n* [SyncUps app](./Examples/SyncUps)\n* [Tic-Tac-Toe](./Examples/TicTacToe)\n* [Todos](./Examples/Todos)\n* [Voice memos](./Examples/VoiceMemos)\n\nLooking for something more substantial?

The reducer is also responsible for returning any effects that should be \nrun, such as API requests, which can be done by returning an `Effect` value.\n* **Store**: The runtime that actually drives your feature. You send all user actions to the store \nso that the store can run the reducer and effects, and you can observe state changes in the store \nso that you can update UI.\n\nThe benefits of doing this are that you will instantly unlock testability of your feature, and you \nwill be able to break large, complex features into smaller domains that can be glued together.\n\nAs a basic example, consider a UI that shows a number along with \"+\" and \"−\" buttons that increment \nand decrement the number. To make things interesting, suppose there is also a button that when \ntapped makes an API request to fetch a random fact about that number and displays it in the view.\n\nTo implement this feature we create a new type that will house the domain and behavior of the \nfeature, and it will be annotated with the `@Reducer` macro:\n\n```swift\nimport ComposableArchitecture\n\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n}\n```\n\nIn here we need to define a type for the feature's state, which consists of an integer for the \ncurrent count, as well as an optional string that represents the fact being presented:\n\n```swift\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n  @ObservableState\n  struct State: Equatable {\n    var count = 0\n    var numberFact: String?\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> [!Note] \n> We've applied the `@ObservableState` macro to `State` in order to take advantage of the\n> observation tools in the library.\n\nWe also need to define a type for the feature's actions. There are the obvious actions, such as \ntapping the decrement button, increment button, or fact button. But there are also some slightly \nnon-obvious ones, such as the action that occurs when we receive a response from the fact API \nrequest:\n\n```swift\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n  @ObservableState\n  struct State: Equatable { /* ... */ }\n  enum Action {\n    case decrementButtonTapped\n    case incrementButtonTapped\n    case numberFactButtonTapped\n    case numberFactResponse(String)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then we implement the `body` property, which is responsible for composing the actual logic and \nbehavior for the feature. In it we can use the `Reduce` reducer to describe how to change the\ncurrent state to the next state, and what effects need to be executed. Some actions don't need to\nexecute effects, and they can return `.none` to represent that:\n\n```swift\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n  @ObservableState\n  struct State: Equatable { /* ... */ }\n  enum Action { /* ... */ }\n\n  var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {\n    Reduce { state, action in\n      switch action {\n      case .decrementButtonTapped:\n        state.count -= 1\n        return .none\n\n      case .incrementButtonTapped:\n        state.count += 1\n        return .none\n\n      case .numberFactButtonTapped:\n        return .run { [count = state.count] send in\n          let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(\n            from: URL(string: \"http://numbersapi.com/\\(count)/trivia\")!\n          )\n          await send(\n            .numberFactResponse(String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self))\n          )\n        }\n\n      case let .numberFactResponse(fact):\n        state.numberFact = fact\n        return .none\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then finally we define the view that displays the feature. It holds onto a `StoreOf<Feature>` \nso that it can observe all changes to the state and re-render, and we can send all user actions to \nthe store so that state changes:\n\n```swift\nstruct FeatureView: View {\n  let store: StoreOf<Feature>\n\n  var body: some View {\n    Form {\n      Section {\n        Text(\"\\(store.count)\")\n        Button(\"Decrement\") { store.send(.decrementButtonTapped) }\n        Button(\"Increment\") { store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) }\n      }\n\n      Section {\n        Button(\"Number fact\") { store.send(.numberFactButtonTapped) }\n      }\n      \n      if let fact = store.numberFact {\n        Text(fact)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt is also straightforward to have a UIKit controller driven off of this store. You can observe\nstate changes in the store in `viewDidLoad`, and then populate the UI components with data from\nthe store. The code is a bit longer than the SwiftUI version, so we have collapsed it here:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>\n\n  ```swift\n  class FeatureViewController: UIViewController {\n    let store: StoreOf<Feature>\n\n    init(store: StoreOf<Feature>) {\n      self.store = store\n      super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n    }\n\n    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {\n      fatalError(\"init(coder:) has not been implemented\")\n    }\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n      super.viewDidLoad()\n\n      let countLabel = UILabel()\n      let decrementButton = UIButton()\n      let incrementButton = UIButton()\n      let factLabel = UILabel()\n      \n      // Omitted: Add subviews and set up constraints...\n      \n      observe { [weak self] in\n        guard let self \n        else { return }\n        \n        countLabel.text = \"\\(self.store.count)\"\n        factLabel.text = self.store.numberFact\n      }\n    }\n\n    @objc private func incrementButtonTapped() {\n      self.store.send(.incrementButtonTapped)\n    }\n    @objc private func decrementButtonTapped() {\n      self.store.send(.decrementButtonTapped)\n    }\n    @objc private func factButtonTapped() {\n      self.store.send(.numberFactButtonTapped)\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n</details>\n\nOnce we are ready to display this view, for example in the app's entry point, we can construct a \nstore. This can be done by specifying the initial state to start the application in, as well as \nthe reducer that will power the application:\n\n```swift\nimport ComposableArchitecture\n\n@main\nstruct MyApp: App {\n  var body: some Scene {\n    WindowGroup {\n      FeatureView(\n        store: Store(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n          Feature()\n        }\n      )\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd that is enough to get something on the screen to play around with. It's definitely a few more \nsteps than if you were to do this in a vanilla SwiftUI way, but there are a few benefits. It gives \nus a consistent manner to apply state mutations, instead of scattering logic in some observable \nobjects and in various action closures of UI components. It also gives us a concise way of \nexpressing side effects. And we can immediately test this logic, including the effects, without \ndoing much additional work.\n\n### Testing\n\n> [!Note] \n> For more in-depth information on testing, see the dedicated [testing][testing-article] article. \n\nTo test use a `TestStore`, which can be created with the same information as the `Store`, but it \ndoes extra work to allow you to assert how your feature evolves as actions are sent:\n\n```swift\n@Test\nfunc basics() async {\n  let store = TestStore(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n    Feature()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce the test store is created we can use it to make an assertion of an entire user flow of steps. \nEach step of the way we need to prove that state changed how we expect. For example, we can \nsimulate the user flow of tapping on the increment and decrement buttons:\n\n```swift\n// Test that tapping on the increment/decrement buttons changes the count\nawait store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) {\n  $0.count = 1\n}\nawait store.send(.decrementButtonTapped) {\n  $0.count = 0\n}\n```\n\nFurther, if a step causes an effect to be executed, which feeds data back into the store, we must \nassert on that. For example, if we simulate the user tapping on the fact button we expect to \nreceive a fact response back with the fact, which then causes the `numberFact` state to be \npopulated:\n\n```swift\nawait store.send(.numberFactButtonTapped)\n\nawait store.receive(\\.numberFactResponse) {\n  $0.numberFact = ???\n}\n```\n\nHowever, how do we know what fact is going to be sent back to us?\n\nCurrently our reducer is using an effect that reaches out into the real world to hit an API server, \nand that means we have no way to control its behavior. We are at the whims of our internet \nconnectivity and the availability of the API server in order to write this test.\n\nIt would be better for this dependency to be passed to the reducer so that we can use a live \ndependency when running the application on a device, but use a mocked dependency for tests. We can \ndo this by adding a property to the `Feature` reducer:\n\n```swift\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n  let numberFact: (Int) async throws -> String\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThen we can use it in the `reduce` implementation:\n\n```swift\ncase .numberFactButtonTapped:\n  return .run { [count = state.count] send in \n    let fact = try await self.numberFact(count)\n    await send(.numberFactResponse(fact))\n  }\n```\n\nAnd in the entry point of the application we can provide a version of the dependency that actually \ninteracts with the real world API server:\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct MyApp: App {\n  var body: some Scene {\n    WindowGroup {\n      FeatureView(\n        store: Store(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n          Feature(\n            numberFact: { number in\n              let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(\n                from: URL(string: \"http://numbersapi.com/\\(number)\")!\n              )\n              return String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)\n            }\n          )\n        }\n      )\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut in tests we can use a mock dependency that immediately returns a deterministic, predictable \nfact: \n\n```swift\n@Test\nfunc basics() async {\n  let store = TestStore(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n    Feature(numberFact: { \"\\($0) is a good number Brent\" })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith that little bit of upfront work we can finish the test by simulating the user tapping on the \nfact button, and then receiving the response from the dependency to present the fact:\n\n```swift\nawait store.send(.numberFactButtonTapped)\n\nawait store.receive(\\.numberFactResponse) {\n  $0.numberFact = \"0 is a good number Brent\"\n}\n```\n\nWe can also improve the ergonomics of using the `numberFact` dependency in our application. Over \ntime the application may evolve into many features, and some of those features may also want access \nto `numberFact`, and explicitly passing it through all layers can get annoying. There is a process \nyou can follow to “register” dependencies with the library, making them instantly available to any \nlayer in the application.\n\n> [!Note] \n> For more in-depth information on dependency management, see the dedicated\n> [dependencies][dependencies-article] article. \n\nWe can start by wrapping the number fact functionality in a new type:\n\n```swift\nstruct NumberFactClient {\n  var fetch: (Int) async throws -> String\n}\n```\n\nAnd then registering that type with the dependency management system by conforming the client to\nthe `DependencyKey` protocol, which requires you to specify the live value to use when running the\napplication in simulators or devices:\n\n```swift\nextension NumberFactClient: DependencyKey {\n  static let liveValue = Self(\n    fetch: { number in\n      let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared\n        .data(from: URL(string: \"http://numbersapi.com/\\(number)\")!\n      )\n      return String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nextension DependencyValues {\n  var numberFact: NumberFactClient {\n    get { self[NumberFactClient.self] }\n    set { self[NumberFactClient.self] = newValue }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith that little bit of upfront work done you can instantly start making use of the dependency in \nany feature by using the `@Dependency` property wrapper:\n\n```diff\n @Reducer\n struct Feature {\n-  let numberFact: (Int) async throws -> String\n+  @Dependency(\\.numberFact) var numberFact\n   \n   …\n\n-  try await self.numberFact(count)\n+  try await self.numberFact.fetch(count)\n }\n```\n\nThis code works exactly as it did before, but you no longer have to explicitly pass the dependency \nwhen constructing the feature's reducer. When running the app in previews, the simulator or on a \ndevice, the live dependency will be provided to the reducer, and in tests the test dependency will \nbe provided.\n\nThis means the entry point to the application no longer needs to construct dependencies:\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct MyApp: App {\n  var body: some Scene {\n    WindowGroup {\n      FeatureView(\n        store: Store(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n          Feature()\n        }\n      )\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the test store can be constructed without specifying any dependencies, but you can still \noverride any dependency you need to for the purpose of the test:\n\n```swift\nlet store = TestStore(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n  Feature()\n} withDependencies: {\n  $0.numberFact.fetch = { \"\\($0) is a good number Brent\" }\n}\n\n// ...\n```\n\nThat is the basics of building and testing a feature in the Composable Architecture. There are \n_a lot_ more things to be explored, such as composition, modularity, adaptability, and complex \neffects. The [Examples](./Examples) directory has a bunch of projects to explore to see more \nadvanced usages.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation for releases and `main` are available here:\n\n* [`main`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture)\n* [1.x.x](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/~/documentation/composablearchitecture)\n\nThere are a number of articles in the documentation that you may find helpful as you become more \ncomfortable with the library:\n\n* [Getting started][getting-started-article]\n* [Dependencies][dependencies-article]\n* [Testing][testing-article]\n* [Navigation][navigation-article]\n* [Sharing state][sharing-state-article]\n* [Performance][performance-article]\n* [Concurrency][concurrency-article]\n* [Bindings][bindings-article]\n\n## FAQ\n\nWe have a [dedicated article][faq-article] for all of the most frequently asked questions and\ncomments people have concerning the library.\n\n## Community\n\nIf you want to discuss the Composable Architecture or have a question about how to use it to solve \na particular problem, there are a number of places you can discuss with fellow \n[Point-Free](http://www.pointfree.co) enthusiasts:\n\n* For long-form discussions, we recommend the [discussions][gh-discussions] tab of this repo.\n* For casual chat, we recommend the [Point-Free Community slack](http://pointfree.co/slack-invite).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can add ComposableArchitecture to an Xcode project by adding it as a package dependency.\n\n  1. From the **File** menu, select **Add Package Dependencies...**\n  2. Enter \"https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture\" into the package \n     repository URL text field\n  3. Depending on how your project is structured:\n      - If you have a single application target that needs access to the library, then add \n        **ComposableArchitecture** directly to your application.\n      - If you want to use this library from multiple Xcode targets, or mix Xcode targets and SPM \n        targets, you must create a shared framework that depends on **ComposableArchitecture** and \n        then depend on that framework in all of your targets. For an example of this, check out the \n        [Tic-Tac-Toe](./Examples/TicTacToe) demo application, which splits lots of features into \n        modules and consumes the static library in this fashion using the **tic-tac-toe** Swift \n        package.\n\n## Companion libraries\n\nThe Composable Architecture is built with extensibility in mind, and there are a number of\ncommunity-supported libraries available to enhance your applications:\n\n* [Composable Architecture Extras](https://github.com/Ryu0118/swift-composable-architecture-extras):\n  A companion library to the Composable Architecture.\n* [TCAComposer](https://github.com/mentalflux/tca-composer): A macro framework for generating\n  boiler-plate code in the Composable Architecture.\n* [TCACoordinators](https://github.com/johnpatrickmorgan/TCACoordinators): The coordinator pattern\n  in the Composable Architecture.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute a library, please [open a\nPR](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/edit/main/README.md) with a link\nto it!\n\n## Translations\n\nThe following translations of this README have been contributed by members of the community:\n\n* [Arabic](https://gist.github.com/NorhanBoghdadi/1b98d55c02b683ddef7e05c2ebcccd47)\n* [French](https://gist.github.com/nikitamounier/0e93eb832cf389db12f9a69da030a2dc)\n* [Hindi](https://gist.github.com/akashsoni01/b358ee0b3b747167964ef6946123c88d)\n* [Indonesian](https://gist.github.com/wendyliga/792ea9ac5cc887f59de70a9e39cc7343)\n* [Italian](https://gist.github.com/Bellaposa/5114e6d4d55fdb1388e8186886d48958)\n* [Japanese](https://gist.github.com/Achoo-kr/2d0712deb77f78b3379551ac7baea3e4)\n* [Korean](https://gist.github.com/Achoo-kr/5d8936d12e71028fcc4a7c5e078ca038)\n* [Polish](https://gist.github.com/MarcelStarczyk/6b6153051f46912a665c32199f0d1d54)\n* [Portuguese](https://gist.github.com/SevioCorrea/2bbf337cd084a58c89f2f7f370626dc8)\n* [Russian](https://gist.github.com/SubvertDev/3317d0c3b35ed601be330d6fc0df5aba)\n* [Simplified Chinese](https://gist.github.com/sh3l6orrr/10c8f7c634a892a9c37214f3211242ad)\n* [Spanish](https://gist.github.com/pitt500/f5e32fccb575ce112ffea2827c7bf942)\n* [Turkish](https://gist.github.com/gokhanamal/93001244ef0c1cec58abeb1afc0de37c)\n* [Ukrainian](https://gist.github.com/barabashd/33b64676195ce41f4bb73c327ea512a8)\n\nIf you'd like to contribute a translation, please [open a\nPR](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/edit/main/README.md) with a link \nto a [Gist](https://gist.github.com)!\n\n## Credits and thanks\n\nThe following people gave feedback on the library at its early stages and helped make the library \nwhat it is today:\n\nPaul Colton, Kaan Dedeoglu, Matt Diephouse, Josef Doležal, Eimantas, Matthew Johnson, George \nKaimakas, Nikita Leonov, Christopher Liscio, Jeffrey Macko, Alejandro Martinez, Shai Mishali, Willis \nPlummer, Simon-Pierre Roy, Justin Price, Sven A.

It lets you create agents that can interact with tools, handle complex workflows, and communicate with users.\n\n### Key features\n\nKey features of Koog include:\n\n- **Multiplatform development**: Deploy agents across JVM, JS, WasmJS, Android, and iOS targets using Kotlin Multiplatform.\n- **Reliability and fault-tolerance**: Handle failures with built-in retries and restore the agent state at specific points during execution with the agent persistence feature.\n- **Intelligent history compression**: Optimize token usage while maintaining context in long-running conversations using advanced built-in history compression techniques.\n- **Enterprise-ready integrations**: Utilize integration with popular JVM frameworks such as Spring Boot and Ktor to embed Koog into your applications.\n- **Observability with OpenTelemetry exporters**: Monitor and debug applications with built-in support for popular observability providers (W&B Weave, Langfuse).\n- **LLM switching and seamless history adaptation**: Switch to a different LLM at any point without losing the existing conversation history, or reroute between multiple LLM providers.\n- **Integration with JVM and Kotlin applications**: Build AI agents with an idiomatic, type-safe Kotlin DSL designed specifically for JVM and Kotlin developers.\n- **Model Context Protocol integration**: Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools in AI agents.\n- **Agent Client Protocol integration**: Build ACP-compliant agents that can communicate with standardized client applications using the Agent Client Protocol (ACP).\n- **Knowledge retrieval and memory**: Retain and retrieve knowledge across conversations using vector embeddings, ranked document storage, and shared agent memory.\n- **Powerful Streaming API**: Process responses in real-time with streaming support and parallel tool calls.\n- **Modular feature system**: Customize agent capabilities through a composable architecture.\n- **Flexible graph workflows**: Design complex agent behaviors using intuitive graph-based workflows.\n- **Custom tool creation**: Enhance your agents with tools that access external systems and APIs.\n- **Comprehensive tracing**: Debug and monitor agent execution with detailed, configurable tracing.\n\n### Available LLM providers and platforms\n\nThe LLM providers and platforms whose LLMs you can use to power your agent capabilities:\n\n- Google\n- OpenAI\n- Anthropic\n- DeepSeek\n- OpenRouter\n- Ollama\n- Bedrock\n\n### Quickstart example\n\nTo help you get started with AI agents, here is a quick example:\n\n```kotlin\nfun main() = runBlocking {\n    // Before you run the example, assign a corresponding API key as an environment variable.\n   val apiKey = System.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") // or Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, etc.\n\n   val agent = AIAgent(\n      promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(apiKey), // or Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, etc.\n      systemPrompt = \"You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions concisely.\",\n      llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o\n   )\n\n   val result = agent.run(\"Hello! How can you help me?\")\n   println(result)\n}\n```\n\n## Using in your projects\n\n### Supported targets\n\nCurrently, the framework supports the JVM, JS, WasmJS and iOS targets.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- JDK 17 or higher is required to use the framework on JVM.\n- kotlinx-coroutines 1.10.2 and kotlinx-serialization 1.8.1 versions should be set explicitly in existing projects. Please check the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml) to know more about the Koog dependencies.\n\n### Gradle (Kotlin DSL)\n\n1. Add dependencies to the `build.gradle.kts` file:\n\n    ```\n    dependencies {\n        implementation(\"ai.koog:koog-agents:0.6.0\")\n    }\n    ```\n2. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories.\n### Gradle (Groovy)\n\n1. Add dependencies to the `build.gradle` file:\n\n    ```\n    dependencies {\n        implementation 'ai.koog:koog-agents:0.6.0'\n    }\n    ```\n2. Make sure that you have `mavenCentral()` in the list of repositories.\n### Maven\n\n1. Add dependencies to the `pom.xml` file:\n\n    ```\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>ai.koog</groupId>\n        <artifactId>koog-agents-jvm</artifactId>\n        <version>0.6.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n    ```\n2.

Download the latest build of VSC extension or Standalone version from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-lsp/releases)\n2. Install it as a VSC Extension via `Extensions | More Action | Install from VSIX`\n    * Alternatively, it is possible to drag-and-drop VSIX extension directly into `Extensions` tool window\n3. Ensure that your Java version is 17 or above\n4. Open a folder with JVM-only Kotlin Gradle project and the project will be immediately recognized and LSP activated\n\n![quickstart_sample.gif](images/quickstart_sample.gif)\n\n### Install kotlin-lsp CLI\n\nFor brew users: `brew install JetBrains/utils/kotlin-lsp`\n\nManual installation:\n1. Download the standalone zip from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-lsp/releases)\n2. Unpack zip\n3. `chmod +x $KOTLIN_LSP_DIR/kotlin-lsp.sh`\n4. Create a symlink inside your PATH `ln -s $KOTLIN_LSP_DIR/kotlin-lsp.sh $HOME/.local/bin/kotlin-lsp`\n\n### Supported features and Roadmap\n\nThe best way to track current capabilities and what is going to be supported in the next builds is this table:\n\n>Important note: currently, only JVM-only Kotlin Gradle projects are supported out-of-the box.\n\n* [ ] Project import\n  * [x] Gradle JVM project import\n  * [ ] Gradle KMP project import\n  * [x] JSON-based build system agnostic import\n    * [ ] Quickstart for JSON\n  * [ ] Maven/Amper import\n  * [ ] Dumb mode for no build system at all\n* [x] Highlighting\n  * [x] Semantic highlighting\n* [x] Navigation\n  * [x] Navigation to Kotlin (source, binary)\n  * [x] Navigation to Kotlin builtins\n  * [x] Navigation to Java (source, binary)\n* [x] Code actions\n  * [x] Quickfixes (i.e. `replace with`)\n  * [x] Kotlin inspections\n  * [x] Organize imports\n  * [x] Go to reference\n* [ ] Refactorings\n  * [x] Rename\n  * [ ] Move\n  * [ ] Change signature\n* [x] On-the-fly Kotlin diagnostics\n* [x] Completion\n  * [x] Analysis-API based completion\n  * [x] IJ-based completion\n    * [x] Enable IJ-based completion\n* [ ] KDoc support\n  * [x] In-project documentation hovers\n  * [ ] Dependencies/Java documentation hovers from `source.jar`\n* [ ] Code formatting\n* [ ] Fully-featured Windows support\n* [x] Reactive updates from the filesystem\n* [x] Document symbols (Outline) \n\n\n### Project Status\n\n**The project is in an experimental, pre-alpha, exploratory phase** with the intention to be productionized.\n\nWe [move fast, break things](https://xkcd.com/1428/), and explore various aspects of the seamless developer experience \nincluding Java interoperability, limits of IntelliJ capabilities as a standalone server, native binaries of the LSP, and \ndebug capabilities.\n\nThe LSP supports most of the essential parts, but its final shape is not near to be defined and \neven the most basic and core parts are being changed on a regular basis.\n\nSo we have the corresponding stability guarantees -- **none**. It is okay to use it in your toy \nprojects, to experiment with it and to provide your feedback, but it is not recommended \nto depend on its stability in your day-to-day work.\n\n\n### Supported platforms\n\nIn the current state, the golden path has been tested for Visual Studio Code with macOS and Linux platforms.\n\nYou can use Kotlin LSP with other LSP-compliant editors, but configuration must be done manually.\nPlease note that Kotlin LSP uses pull-based diagnostics, so the editor must support that.\n\nYou can find a standalone LSP launch script in [kotlin-lsp.sh](scripts/kotlin-lsp.sh) along\nwith _very experimental_ (aka \"works on someone's machine\") instructions that setup LSP for other editors in [scripts](scripts) folder.\nSee `./kotlin-lsp.sh --help` for available options.\n\n### Source code\n\nCurrently, the LSP implementation is partially closed-source, primarily for the sake of development speed convenience -- \nit heavily depends on parts of IntelliJ, Fleet, and our distributed Bazel build that allows us to \niterate quickly and experiment much faster, cutting corners and re-using internal infrastructure where it helps.\nAfter the initial stabilization phase and defining the final set of capabilities, we will de-couple the LSP implementation from the internal repository \nand build pipelines and open source it completely (with an explicit dependency on IntelliJ), this is a temporary constraint.\nVSC extension is mirrored into [kotlin-vscode](kotlin-vscode) as it does not depend on anything internal.\n\n### Feedback and issues\n\nThe best way to provide your feedback or report an issue is to file a bug [in GitHub issues](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-lsp/issues/new).\n\nAs a temporary limitation, direct contributions are not supported as this repository is a read-only mirror,\nbut it is possible to open a PR into the documentation, and it will be integrated manually by maintainers.\n",

Apply the Gradle plugin:**\n\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n  id(\"dev.zacsweers.metro\") version \"<version>\"\n}\n```\n\n**2. Define a dependency graph:**\n\n```kotlin\n@DependencyGraph\ninterface AppGraph {\n  val repository: UserRepository\n\n  @Provides\n  fun provideApi(): Api = ApiImpl()\n}\n\n@Inject\nclass UserRepository(private val api: Api)\n```\n\n**3. Create and use the graph:**\n\n```kotlin\nval graph = createGraph<AppGraph>()\nval repository = graph.repository\n```\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\n📚 **[zacsweers.github.io/metro](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/)**\n\n| Topic                                                                            |                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| [Installation](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/installation/)           | Setup and configuration                        |\n| [Dependency Graphs](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/dependency-graphs/) | Define and create graphs                       |\n| [Provides](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/provides/)                   | Provider functions and properties              |\n| [Injection Types](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/injection-types/)     | Constructor, assisted, and member injection    |\n| [Scopes](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/scopes/)                       | Scoping and lifecycle management               |\n| [Aggregation](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/aggregation/)             | Anvil-style contributions across modules       |\n| [Interop](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/interop/)                     | Dagger, kotlin-inject, and Guice compatibility |\n| [Performance](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/performance/)             | Build and runtime performance                  |\n| [Compatibility](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/compatibility/)         | Supported Kotlin versions                      |\n| [FAQ](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/faq/)                             | Frequently asked questions                     |\n| [API Docs](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/latest/api/)                        | Generated KDocs                                |\n\n---\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nMetro supports JVM, Android, JS, WASM, and Native targets.

In its different branches you'll find the same app (a TODO app) implemented with small differences.\n\nIn this branch you'll find:\n*   User Interface built with **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)** \n*   A single-activity architecture, using **[Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)**.\n*   A presentation layer that contains a Compose screen (View) and a **ViewModel** per screen (or feature).\n*   Reactive UIs using **[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)** and **[coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)** for asynchronous operations.\n*   A **data layer** with a repository and two data sources (local using Room and a fake remote).\n*   Two **product flavors**, `mock` and `prod`, [to ease development and testing](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/12/leveraging-product-flavors-in-android.html).\n*   A collection of unit, integration and e2e **tests**, including \"shared\" tests that can be run on emulator/device.\n*   Dependency injection using [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<img src=\"screenshots/screenshots.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\">\n\n## Why a to-do app?\n\nThe app in this project aims to be simple enough that you can understand it quickly, but complex enough to showcase difficult design decisions and testing scenarios. For more information, see the [app's specification](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/wiki/To-do-app-specification).\n\n## What is it not?\n*   A template. Check out the [Architecture Templates](https://github.com/android/architecture-templates) instead.\n*   A UI/Material Design sample. The interface of the app is deliberately kept simple to focus on architecture. Check out the [Compose Samples](https://github.com/android/compose-samples) instead.\n*   A real production app with network access, user authentication, etc. Check out the [Now in Android app](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) instead.\n\n## Who is it for?\n\n*   Intermediate developers and beginners looking for a way to structure their app in a testable and maintainable way.\n*   Advanced developers looking for quick reference.\n\n## Opening a sample in Android Studio\n\nTo open one of the samples in Android Studio, begin by checking out one of the sample branches, and then open the root directory in Android Studio. The following series of steps illustrate how to open the sample.\n\nClone the repository:\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:android/architecture-samples.git\n```\n\nFinally open the `architecture-samples/` directory in Android Studio.\n\n### License\n\n\n```\nCopyright 2024 Google, Inc.\n\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor\nlicense agreements.

[中文文档](https://www.xuxueli.com/xxl-job/)\n- [English Documentation](https://www.xuxueli.com/xxl-job/en/)\n\n\n## Communication    \n- [社区交流](https://www.xuxueli.com/page/community.html)\n\n\n## Features\n- 1、简单：支持通过Web页面对任务进行CRUD操作，操作简单，一分钟上手；\n- 2、动态：支持动态修改任务状态、启动/停止任务，以及终止运行中任务，即时生效；\n- 3、调度中心HA（中心式）：调度采用中心式设计，“调度中心”自研调度组件并支持集群部署，可保证调度中心HA；\n- 4、执行器HA（分布式）：任务分布式执行，任务\"执行器\"支持集群部署，可保证任务执行HA；\n- 5、注册中心: 执行器会周期性自动注册任务, 调度中心将会自动发现注册的任务并触发执行。同时，也支持手动录入执行器地址；\n- 6、弹性扩容缩容：一旦有新执行器机器上线或者下线，下次调度时将会重新分配任务；\n- 7、触发策略：提供丰富的任务触发策略，包括：Cron触发、固定间隔触发、固定延时触发、API（事件）触发、人工触发、父子任务触发；\n- 8、调度过期策略：调度中心错过调度时间的补偿处理策略，包括：忽略、立即补偿触发一次等；\n- 9、阻塞处理策略：调度过于密集执行器来不及处理时的处理策略，策略包括：单机串行（默认）、丢弃后续调度、覆盖之前调度；\n- 10、任务超时控制：支持自定义任务超时时间，任务运行超时将会主动中断任务；\n- 11、任务失败重试：支持自定义任务失败重试次数，当任务失败时将会按照预设的失败重试次数主动进行重试；其中分片任务支持分片粒度的失败重试；\n- 12、任务失败告警；默认提供邮件方式失败告警，同时预留扩展接口，可方便的扩展短信、钉钉等告警方式；\n- 13、路由策略：执行器集群部署时提供丰富的路由策略，包括：第一个、最后一个、轮询、随机、一致性HASH、最不经常使用、最近最久未使用、故障转移、忙碌转移等；\n- 14、分片广播任务：执行器集群部署时，任务路由策略选择\"分片广播\"情况下，一次任务调度将会广播触发集群中所有执行器执行一次任务，可根据分片参数开发分片任务；\n- 15、动态分片：分片广播任务以执行器为维度进行分片，支持动态扩容执行器集群从而动态增加分片数量，协同进行业务处理；在进行大数据量业务操作时可显著提升任务处理能力和速度。\n- 16、故障转移：任务路由策略选择\"故障转移\"情况下，如果执行器集群中某一台机器故障，将会自动Failover切换到一台正常的执行器发送调度请求。\n- 17、任务进度监控：支持实时监控任务进度；\n- 18、Rolling实时日志：支持在线查看调度结果，并且支持以Rolling方式实时查看执行器输出的完整的执行日志；\n- 19、GLUE：提供Web IDE，支持在线开发任务逻辑代码，动态发布，实时编译生效，省略部署上线的过程。支持30个版本的历史版本回溯。\n- 20、脚本任务：支持以GLUE模式开发和运行脚本任务，包括Shell、Python、NodeJS、PHP、PowerShell等类型脚本;\n- 21、命令行任务：原生提供通用命令行任务Handler（Bean任务，\"CommandJobHandler\"）；业务方只需要提供命令行即可；\n- 22、任务依赖：支持配置子任务依赖，当父任务执行结束且执行成功后将会主动触发一次子任务的执行, 多个子任务用逗号分隔；\n- 23、一致性：“调度中心”通过DB锁保证集群分布式调度的一致性, 一次任务调度只会触发一次执行；\n- 24、自定义任务参数：支持在线配置调度任务入参，即时生效；\n- 25、调度线程池：调度系统多线程触发调度运行，确保调度精确执行，不被堵塞；\n- 26、数据加密：调度中心和执行器之间的通讯进行数据加密，提升调度信息安全性；\n- 27、邮件报警：任务失败时支持邮件报警，支持配置多邮件地址群发报警邮件；\n- 28、推送maven中央仓库: 将会把最新稳定版推送到maven中央仓库, 方便用户接入和使用;\n- 29、运行报表：支持实时查看运行数据，如任务数量、调度次数、执行器数量等；以及调度报表，如调度日期分布图，调度成功分布图等；\n- 30、全异步：任务调度流程全异步化设计实现，如异步调度、异步运行、异步回调等，有效对密集调度进行流量削峰，理论上支持任意时长任务的运行；\n- 31、跨语言/OpenAPI：调度中心与执行器提供语言无关的 OpenApi（RESTful 格式），第三方任意语言可据此对接调度中心或者实现执行器，实现多语言支持。除此之外，还提供了 “多任务模式”和“httpJobHandler”等其他跨语言方案；\n- 32、国际化：调度中心支持国际化设置，提供中文、英文两种可选语言，默认为中文；\n- 33、容器化：提供官方docker镜像，并实时更新推送dockerhub，进一步实现产品开箱即用；\n- 34、线程池隔离：调度线程池进行隔离拆分，慢任务自动降级进入\"Slow\"线程池，避免耗尽调度线程，提高系统稳定性；\n- 35、用户管理：支持在线管理系统用户，存在管理员、普通用户两种角色；\n- 36、权限控制：执行器维度进行权限控制，管理员拥有全量权限，普通用户需要分配执行器权限后才允许相关操作；\n- 37、AI任务：原生提供AI执行器，并内置多个AI任务Handler，与spring-ai、ollama、dify等集成打通，支持快速开发AI类任务。\n- 38、审计日志：记录任务操作敏感信息，用于系统监控、审计和安全分析，可快速追溯异常行为以及定位排查问题。\n- 39、优雅停机：调度中心停机，检测时间轮非空时主动等待调度完成；客户端停机，检测存在运行中任务时，停止接收新任务并主动等待任务执行完成；\n\n##

It empowers developers to create workflows that define interactions between services, databases, and other external systems.\n\nConductor is designed to enable flexible, resilient, and scalable workflows. It allows you to compose services into complex workflows without coupling them tightly, simplifying orchestration across cloud-native applications and enterprise systems alike.\n\n## Key benefits\n* **Resilience and Error Handling:** Conductor enables automatic retries and fallback mechanisms.\n* **Scalability:** Built to scale with complex workflows in high-traffic environments.\n* **Observability:** Provides monitoring and debugging capabilities for workflows.\n* **Ease of Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with microservices, external APIs, and legacy systems.\n\n## Features\n* **Workflow as code:** Define workflows in JSON and manage them with versioning.\n* **Rich task types:** Includes task types like HTTP, JSON, Lambda, Sub Workflow, and Event tasks, allowing for flexible workflow definitions.\n* **Dynamic workflow management:** Workflows can evolve independently of the underlying services.\n* **Built-in UI:** A customizable UI is available to monitor and manage workflows.\n* **Flexible persistence and queue options:** Use Redis, MySQL, Postgres, and more.\n- - - \n# Getting Started with Conductor\n\n## Requirements\n* Install Docker Desktop ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/), [Windows/PC](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/), [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/))\n* Install Java (JDK) 17 or newer\n* Node 14 for the UI to build\n  * _Earlier versions may work, but are untested_\n  \n\n## Quick Start guide\n\n### Clone the repo\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/conductor-oss/conductor\n```\n\n### Change to new Conductor directory\n\n```shell\ncd conductor\n```\n\n### (Optional) Install Git Hook for Auto-formatting\n\nTo automatically format code before commits:\n\n```shell\nln -s ../../hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit\n```\n\n### Start with Docker Compose (_recommended for local deployment_)\n\n```shell\ndocker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up\n```\n\n## Create your first workflow\n\n### With the UI:\n* http://localhost:8127\n\n### Or the REST API with your preferred HTTP client:\n* http://localhost:8080\n\n# Documentation\nCheck-out the [Conductor docs](https://github.com/conductor-oss/conductor/tree/main/docs) for additional details\n- - - \n# Database Specifications\n* **Default persistence**: Redis (standalone) for DB and queues\n  * **Alternative peristence**:  Postgres, MySQL\n* **Default indexing backend**: [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) 7.x\n  * **Alternative indexing backends**: [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) 2.x, Postgres, Sqlite\n\n## Configuration for various database backends\n\n| Backend              | Configuration                                                                             |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Redis + ES7 (default)         | [config-redis.properties](docker/server/config/config-redis.properties)                   |\n| Redis + OS   | [config-redis-os.properties](docker/server/config/config-redis-os.properties)             |\n| Postgres             | [config-postgres.properties](docker/server/config/config-postgres.properties)             |\n| Postgres + ES7       | [config-postgres-es7.properties](docker/server/config/config-postgres-es7.properties)     |\n| MySQL + ES7          | [config-mysql.properties](docker/server/config/config-mysql.properties)                   |\n\n\n# Build from source\nBuild from source and deploy Conductor as a standalone Java application.

      "readme": "Eclipse Mosquitto\n=================\n\nMosquitto is an open source implementation of a server for version 5.0, 3.1.1,\nand 3.1 of the MQTT protocol. It also includes a C and C++ client library, and\nthe `mosquitto_pub` and `mosquitto_sub` utilities for publishing and\nsubscribing.\n\n## Links\n\nSee the following links for more information on MQTT:\n\n- Community page: <http://mqtt.org/>\n- MQTT v3.1.1 standard: <https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/mqtt-v3.1.1.html>\n- MQTT v5.0 standard: <https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html>\n\nMosquitto project information is available at the following locations:\n\n- Main homepage: <https://mosquitto.org/>\n- Find existing bugs or submit a new bug: <https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto/issues>\n- Source code repository: <https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto>\n\nThere is also a public test server available at <https://test.mosquitto.org/>\n\n## Installing\n\nSee <https://mosquitto.org/download/> for details on installing binaries for\nvarious platforms.\n\n## Quick start\n\nIf you have installed a binary package the broker should have been started\nautomatically. If not, it can be started with a very basic configuration:\n\n    mosquitto\n\nThen use `mosquitto_sub` to subscribe to a topic:\n\n    mosquitto_sub -t 'test/topic' -v\n\nAnd to publish a message:\n\n    mosquitto_pub -t 'test/topic' -m 'hello world'\n\nNote that starting the broker like this allows anonymous/unauthenticated access\nbut only from the local computer, so it's only really useful for initial testing.\n\nIf you want to have clients from another computer connect, you will need to\nprovide a configuration file. If you have installed from a binary package, you\nwill probably already have a configuration file at somewhere like\n`/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf`. If you've compiled from source, you can write\nyour config file then run as `mosquitto -c /path/to/mosquitto.conf`.\n\nTo start your config file you define a listener and you will need to think\nabout what authentication you require. It is not advised to run your broker\nwith anonymous access when it is publically available.\n\nFor details on how to do this, look at the\n[authentication methods](https://mosquitto.org/documentation/authentication-methods/)\navailable and the [dynamic security plugin](https://mosquitto.org/documentation/dynamic-security/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for the broker, clients and client library API can be found in\nthe man pages, which are available online at <https://mosquitto.org/man/>. There\nare also pages with an introduction to the features of MQTT, the\n`mosquitto_passwd` utility for dealing with username/passwords, and a\ndescription of the configuration file options available for the broker.\n\nDetailed client library API documentation can be found at <https://mosquitto.org/api/>\n\n## Building from source\n\nTo build from source the recommended route for end users is to download the\narchive from <https://mosquitto.org/download/>.\n\nOn Windows and Mac, use `cmake` to build. On other platforms, just run `make`\nto build. For Windows, see also `README-windows.md`.\n\nIf you are building from the git repository then the documentation will not\nalready be built. Use `make binary` to skip building the man pages, or install\n`docbook-xsl` on Debian/Ubuntu systems.\n\n### Build Dependencies\n\n* c-ares (libc-ares-dev on Debian based systems) - only when compiled with `make WITH_SRV=yes`\n* cJSON - for client JSON output support. Disable with `make WITH_CJSON=no` Auto detected with CMake.\n* libwebsockets (libwebsockets-dev) - enable with `make WITH_WEBSOCKETS=yes`\n* openssl (libssl-dev on Debian based systems) - disable with `make WITH_TLS=no`\n* pthreads - for client library thread support. This is required to support the\n  `mosquitto_loop_start()` and `mosquitto_loop_stop()` functions. If compiled\n  without pthread support, the library isn't guaranteed to be thread safe.\n* uthash / utlist - bundled versions of these headers are provided, disable their use with `make WITH_BUNDLED_DEPS=no`\n* xsltproc (xsltproc and docbook-xsl on Debian based systems) - only needed when building from git sources - disable with `make WITH_DOCS=no`\n\nEquivalent options for enabling/disabling features are available when using the CMake build.\n\n\n## Credits\n\nMosquitto was written by Roger Light <roger@atchoo.org>\n",

      "readme": "# Telegram iOS Source Code Compilation Guide\n\nWe welcome all developers to use our API and source code to create applications on our platform.\nThere are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment.\n\n# Creating your Telegram Application\n\n1. [**Obtain your own api_id**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) for your application.\n2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.\n3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.\n3. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.\n4. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.\n\n# Quick Compilation Guide\n\n## Get the Code\n\n```\ngit clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS.git\n```\n\n## Setup Xcode\n\nInstall Xcode (directly from https://developer.apple.com/download/applications or using the App Store).\n\n## Adjust Configuration\n\n1. Generate a random identifier:\n```\nopenssl rand -hex 8\n```\n2. Create a new Xcode project. Use `Telegram` as the Product Name. Use `org.{identifier from step 1}` as the Organization Identifier.\n3. Open `Keychain Access` and navigate to `Certificates`. Locate `Apple Development: your@email.address (XXXXXXXXXX)` and double tap the certificate. Under `Details`, locate `Organizational Unit`. This is the Team ID.\n4. Edit `build-system/template_minimal_development_configuration.json`. Use data from the previous steps.\n\n## Generate an Xcode project\n\n```\npython3 build-system/Make/Make.py \\\n    --cacheDir=\"$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache\" \\\n    generateProject \\\n    --configurationPath=build-system/template_minimal_development_configuration.json \\\n    --xcodeManagedCodesigning\n```\n\n# Advanced Compilation Guide\n\n## Xcode\n\n1. Copy and edit `build-system/appstore-configuration.json`.\n2. Copy `build-system/fake-codesigning`. Create and download provisioning profiles, using the `profiles` folder as a reference for the entitlements.\n3. Generate an Xcode project:\n```\npython3 build-system/Make/Make.py \\\n    --cacheDir=\"$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache\" \\\n    generateProject \\\n    --configurationPath=configuration_from_step_1.json \\\n    --codesigningInformationPath=directory_from_step_2\n```\n\n## IPA\n\n1. Repeat the steps from the previous section. Use distribution provisioning profiles.\n2. Run:\n```\npython3 build-system/Make/Make.py \\\n    --cacheDir=\"$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache\" \\\n    build \\\n    --configurationPath=...see previous section... \\\n    --codesigningInformationPath=...see previous section... \\\n    --buildNumber=100001 \\\n    --configuration=release_arm64\n```\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Xcode is stuck at \"build-request.json not updated yet\"\n\nOccasionally, you might observe the following message in your build log:\n```\n\"/Users/xxx/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Telegram-xxx/Build/Intermediates.noindex/XCBuildData/xxx.xcbuilddata/build-request.json\" not updated yet, waiting...\n```\n\nShould this occur, simply cancel the ongoing build and initiate a new one.\n\n## Telegram_xcodeproj: no such package \n\nFollowing a system restart, the auto-generated Xcode project might encounter a build failure accompanied by this error:\n```\nERROR: Skipping '@rules_xcodeproj_generated//generator/Telegram/Telegram_xcodeproj:Telegram_xcodeproj': no such package '@rules_xcodeproj_generated//generator/Telegram/Telegram_xcodeproj': BUILD file not found in directory 'generator/Telegram/Telegram_xcodeproj' of external repository @rules_xcodeproj_generated. Add a BUILD file to a directory to mark it as a package.\n```\n\nIf you encounter this issue, re-run the project generation steps in the README.\n\n\n# Tips\n\n## Codesigning is not required for simulator-only builds\n\nAdd `--disableProvisioningProfiles`:\n```\npython3 build-system/Make/Make.py \\\n    --cacheDir=\"$HOME/telegram-bazel-cache\" \\\n    generateProject \\\n    --configurationPath=path-to-configuration.json \\\n    --codesigningInformationPath=path-to-provisioning-data \\\n    --disableProvisioningProfiles\n```\n\n## Versions\n\nEach release is built using a specific Xcode version (see `versions.json`). The helper script checks the versions of the installed software and reports an error if they don't match the ones specified in `versions.json`. It is possible to bypass these checks:\n\n```\npython3 build-system/Make/Make.py --overrideXcodeVersion build ... # Don't check the version of Xcode\n```\n",

This release also updates WolfSSL to version v5.6.4.\n\nThe [FreeRTOS 202212.00](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/tree/202212.00) release updates FreeRTOS Kernel, FreeRTOS+TCP, coreMQTT, corePKCS11, coreHTTP, coreJSON, AWS IoT Over-the-air-Updates (OTA), AWS IoT Device Shadow, AWS IoT Jobs, AWS IoT Device Defender, Backoff Algorithm, AWS IoT Fleet Provisioning, coreSNTP, SigV4, and FreeRTOS Cellular Interface libraries to their [LTS 2.0](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-LTS/blob/202210-LTS/CHANGELOG.md) versions. It also updates coreMQTT Agent to v1.2.0 to be compatible with coreMQTT v2.X.X, and updates MbedTLS to v3.2.1. This release also adds Visual Studio static library projects for the FreeRTOS Kernel, FreeRTOS+TCP, Logging, MbedTLS, coreHTTP, and corePKCS11. With the addition of the static library projects, all Visual Studio projects have been updated to use them. Additionally, all demos dependent on coreMQTT have been updated to work with coreMQTT v2.X.X.\n\n## Getting started\nThe [FreeRTOS.org](https://www.freertos.org) website contains a [FreeRTOS Kernel Quick Start Guide](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/01-FreeRTOS-quick-start/01-Beginners-guide/02-Quick-start-guide), a [list of supported devices and compilers](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS_ports.html), the [API reference](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/01-Task-creation/00-TaskHandle), and many other resources.\n\n### Getting help\nYou can use your Github login to get support from both the FreeRTOS community and directly from the primary FreeRTOS developers on our [active support forum](https://forums.freertos.org).  The [FAQ](https://www.freertos.org/Why-FreeRTOS/FAQs) provides another support resource.\n\n## Cloning this repository\nThis repo uses [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to bring in dependent components.\n\n**Note:** If you download the ZIP file provided by the GitHub UI, you will not get the contents of the submodules. (The ZIP file is also not a valid git repository)\n\nIf using Windows, because this repository and its submodules contain symbolic links, set `core.symlinks` to true with the following command:\n```\ngit config --global core.symlinks true\n```\nIn addition to this, either enable [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) or, whenever using a git command that writes to the system (e.g. `git pull`, `git clone`, and `git submodule update --init --recursive`), use a console elevated as administrator so that git can properly create symbolic links for this repository. Otherwise, symbolic links will be written as normal files with the symbolic links' paths in them as text. [This](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/) gives more explanation.\n\nTo clone using HTTPS:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS.git --recurse-submodules\n```\nUsing SSH:\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS.git --recurse-submodules\n```\n\nIf you have downloaded the repo without using the `--recurse-submodules` argument, you need to run:\n```\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n## Repository structure\nThis repository contains the FreeRTOS Kernel, a number of supplementary libraries including the LTS ones, and a comprehensive set of example projects.  Many libraries (including the FreeRTOS kernel) are included as Git submodules from their own Git repositories.\n\n### Kernel source code and example projects\n```FreeRTOS/Source``` contains the FreeRTOS kernel source code (submoduled from https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel).\n\n```FreeRTOS/Demo``` contains pre-configured example projects that demonstrate the FreeRTOS kernel executing on different hardware platforms and using different compilers.\n\n### Supplementary library source code and example projects\n```FreeRTOS-Plus/Source``` contains source code for additional FreeRTOS component libraries, as well as select partner provided libraries. These subdirectories contain further readme files and links to documentation.\n\n```FreeRTOS-Plus/Demo``` contains pre-configured example projects that demonstrate the FreeRTOS kernel used with the additional FreeRTOS component libraries.\n\n## Previous releases\n[Releases](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/releases) contains older FreeRTOS releases.\n\n\n## Learning FreeRTOS\n\nFor detailed and up-to-date information about FreeRTOS, including getting started guides and documentation for both new and experienced users, please refer to the official FreeRTOS website:\nhttps://www.freertos.org/\n\n## FreeRTOS Lab Projects\nFreeRTOS Lab projects are libraries and demos that are fully functional, but may be experimental or undergoing optimizations and refactorization to improve memory usage, modularity, documentation, demo usability, or test coverage.\n\nMost FreeRTOS Lab libraries can be found in the [FreeRTOS-Labs repository](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Labs).\n\nA number of FreeRTOS Lab Demos can be found in the [FreeRTOS Github Organization](https://github.com/FreeRTOS) by searching for \"Lab\" or following [this link](https://github.com/FreeRTOS?q=Lab&type=&language=) to the search results.\n\n## coreMQTT Agent Demos\nThe [FreeRTOS/coreMQTT-Agent-Demos](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT-Agent-Demos) repository contains demos to showcase use of the [coreMQTT-Agent](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT-Agent) library to share an MQTT connection between multiple application tasks.\n\nThe demos show a single MQTT connection usage between multiple application tasks for interacting with AWS services (including [Over-the-air-Updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-ota-dev.html), [Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html),\n [Device Defender](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-defender.html)) alongside performing simple Publish-Subscribe operations.\n## CBMC\n\nThe `FreeRTOS/Test/CBMC/proofs` directory contains CBMC proofs.\n\nTo learn more about CBMC and proofs specifically, review the training material [here](https://model-checking.github.io/cbmc-training).\n\nIn order to run these proofs you will need to install CBMC and other tools by following the instructions [here](https://model-checking.github.io/cbmc-training/installation.html).\n",

vue-demi@0.14.6\n\n#pptx文档预览组件\nnpm install @vue-office/pptx vue-demi@0.14.6\n```\n如果是vue2.6版本或以下还需要额外安装 @vue/composition-api\n```shell\nnpm install @vue/composition-api\n```\n\n## 使用示例\n\n文档预览场景大致可以分为三种：\n- 有文档CDN地址，比如 https://***.docx，将文档地址字符串传给组件的src属性\n- 通过接口请求获取文件内容，此时可以获取文件的ArrayBuffer或Blob格式数据传给组件的src属性\n- 文件上传时预览，此时可以获取文件的ArrayBuffer或Blob格式数据传给组件的src属性\n\n<details>\n<summary>docx文件预览示例 （三种使用方式均有示例）</summary>\n\n**1. 使用网络地址预览**\n```vue\n<template>\n    <vue-office-docx\n        :src=\"docx\"\n        style=\"height: 100vh;\"\n        @rendered=\"rendered\"\n    />\n</template>\n\n<script>\n//引入VueOfficeDocx组件\nimport VueOfficeDocx from '@vue-office/docx'\n//引入相关样式\nimport '@vue-office/docx/lib/index.css'\n\nexport default {\n    components:{\n        VueOfficeDocx\n    },\n    data(){\n        return {\n            docx: 'http://static.shanhuxueyuan.com/test6.docx' //设置文档网络地址，可以是相对地址\n        }\n    },\n    methods:{\n        rendered(){\n            console.log(\"渲染完成\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n**2. 上传文件预览**\n\n读取文件的ArrayBuffer\n```vue\n<template>\n    <div>\n        <input type=\"file\" @change=\"changeHandle\"/>\n        <vue-office-docx :src=\"src\"/>\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport VueOfficeDocx from '@vue-office/docx'\nimport '@vue-office/docx/lib/index.css'\n\nexport default {\n    components: {\n        VueOfficeDocx\n    },\n    data(){\n        return {\n            src: ''\n        }\n    },\n    methods:{\n        changeHandle(event){\n            let file = event.target.files[0]\n            let fileReader = new FileReader()\n            fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(file)\n            fileReader.onload =  () => {\n                this.src = fileReader.result\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n**3. 二进制文件预览**\n\n如果后端给的不是CDN地址，而是一些POST接口，该接口返回二进制流，则可以调用接口获取文件的ArrayBuffer数据，传递给src属性。\n\n```vue\n<template>\n    <vue-office-docx\n        :src=\"docx\"\n        style=\"height: 100vh;\"\n        @rendered=\"rendered\"\n    />\n</template>\n\n<script>\n//引入VueOfficeDocx组件\nimport VueOfficeDocx from '@vue-office/docx'\n//引入相关样式\nimport '@vue-office/docx/lib/index.css'\n\nexport default {\n    components:{\n        VueOfficeDocx\n    },\n    data(){\n        return {\n            docx: ''\n        }\n    },\n    mounted(){\n        fetch('你的API文件地址', {\n            method: 'post'\n        }).then(res=>{\n            //读取文件的arrayBuffer\n            res.arrayBuffer().then(res=>{\n                this.docx = res\n            })\n        })\n    },\n    methods:{\n        rendered(){\n            console.log(\"渲染完成\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>excel 文件预览示例 </summary>\n\n通过网络地址预览示例如下，通过文件ArrayBuffer预览和上面docx的使用方式一致。\n```vue\n<template>\n    <vue-office-excel\n        :src=\"excel\"\n        style=\"height: 100vh;\"\n

This page only gives very basic information.\n\nYou require the following to build Netty:\n\n* Latest stable [OpenJDK 8](https://adoptium.net/)\n* Latest stable [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)\n* If you are on Linux or MacOS, you need [additional development packages](https://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html) installed on your system, because you'll build the native transport.\n\nNote that this is build-time requirement.  JDK 5 (for 3.x) or 6 (for 4.0+ / 4.1+) is enough to run your Netty-based application.\n\n## Branches to look\n\nDevelopment of all versions takes place in each branch whose name is identical to `<majorVersion>.<minorVersion>`.  For example, the development of 3.9 and 4.1 resides in [the branch '3.9'](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/3.9) and [the branch '4.1'](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/4.1) respectively.\n\n## Usage with JDK 9+\n\nYou can read the [Modular Netty guide](testsuite-jpms/README.md) to learn more about using Netty with the Java Platform Module System, the guide \ncontains a user section and a developer section for Netty contributors.\n",

It reduces time spent writing and maintaining the same code for [different platforms](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/mpp-supported-platforms.html) while retaining the flexibility and benefits of native programming.\n\n * [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/) for sharing business logic and UI between Android, iOS, desktop, and web.\n * [Get started with Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/get-started.html)\n * [Kotlin Multiplatform Benefits](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html)\n * [Share code on all platforms](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/mpp-share-on-platforms.html#share-code-on-all-platforms)\n * [Share code on similar platforms](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/mpp-share-on-platforms.html#share-code-on-similar-platforms)\n\n## Editing Kotlin\n\n * [Kotlin IntelliJ IDEA Plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started.html) ([source code](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/tree/master/plugins/kotlin))\n * [Kotlin Eclipse Plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started-eclipse.html)\n * [Kotlin Sublime Text Package](https://github.com/vkostyukov/kotlin-sublime-package)\n\n## Build environment requirements\n\nThis repository is using [Gradle toolchains](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html) feature\nto select and auto-provision required JDKs from [Eclipse Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) project.\n\nAlternatively, it is still possible to only provide required JDKs via environment variables \n(see [gradle.properties](./gradle.properties#L5) for supported variable names). To ensure Gradle uses only JDKs \nfrom environmental variables - disable Gradle toolchain auto-detection by passing `-Porg.gradle.java.installations.auto-detect=false` option\n(or put it into `$GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties`).\n\nOn Windows you might need to add long paths setting to the repo:\n\n    git config core.longpaths true \n\n## Building\n\nThe project is built with Gradle. Run Gradle to build the project and to run the tests \nusing the following command on Unix/macOS:\n\n    ./gradlew <tasks-and-options>\n    \nor the following command on Windows:\n\n    gradlew <tasks-and-options>\n\nOn the first project configuration gradle will download and setup the dependencies on:\n\n* `intellij-core` is a part of command line compiler and contains only necessary APIs.\n* `idea-full` is a full blown IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to be used in the plugin module.\n\nThese dependencies are quite large, so depending on the quality of your internet connection \nyou might face timeouts getting them. In this case, you can increase timeout by specifying the following \ncommand line parameters on the first run: \n    \n    ./gradlew -Dhttp.socketTimeout=60000 -Dhttp.connectionTimeout=60000\n\n## Important gradle tasks\n\n- `clean` - clean build results\n- `dist` - assembles the compiler distribution into `dist/kotlinc/` folder\n- `install` - build and install all public artifacts into local maven repository\n- `coreLibsTest` - build and run stdlib, reflect and kotlin-test tests\n- `gradlePluginTest` - build and run gradle plugin tests\n- `compilerTest` - build and run all compiler tests\n\nTo reproduce TeamCity build use `-Pteamcity=true` flag. Local builds don't run proguard and have jar compression disabled by default.\n\n**OPTIONAL:** Some artifacts, mainly Maven plugin ones, are built separately with Maven.\nRefer to [libraries/ReadMe.md](libraries/ReadMe.md) for details.\n\nTo build Kotlin/Native, see\n[kotlin-native/README.md](kotlin-native/README.md#building-from-source).\n\n## <a name=\"working-in-idea\"></a> Working with the project in IntelliJ IDEA\n\nIt is recommended to use the latest released version of Intellij IDEA (Community or Ultimate Edition). You can download IntelliJ IDEA [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).\n\nAfter cloning the project, import the project in IntelliJ by choosing the project directory in the Open project dialog.\n\nFor handy work with compiler tests it's recommended to use [Kotlin Compiler Test Helper](https://github.com/demiurg906/test-data-helper-plugin).\n\n### Dependency verification\n\nWe have a [dependencies verification](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_verification.html) feature enabled in the\nrepository for all Gradle builds. Gradle will check hashes (md5 and sha256) of used dependencies and will fail builds with\n`Dependency verification failed` errors when local artifacts are absent or have different hashes listed in the\n[verification-metadata.xml](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/gradle/verification-metadata.xml) file.\n\nIt's expected that `verification-metadata.xml` should only be updated with the commits that modify the build. There are some tips how\nto perform such updates:\n\n- Delete `components` section of `verification-metadata.xml` to avoid stockpiling of old unused dependencies. You may use the following command:\n```bash\n#macOS\nsed -i '' -e '/<components>/,/<\\/components>/d' gradle/verification-metadata.xml\n#Linux & Git for Windows\nsed -i -e '/<components>/,/<\\/components>/d' gradle/verification-metadata.xml\n```\n- Re-generate dependencies with Gradle's `--write-verification-metadata` command (verify update relates to your changes)\n\n```bash\n./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256,md5 -Pkotlin.native.enabled=true resolveDependencies\n```\n\n*`resolveDependencies` task resolves dependencies for all platforms including dependencies downloaded by plugins.*\n\nYou can also use `./scripts/update-verification-metadata.sh` script which includes both of these steps\n\nKeep in mind:\n\n- If you’re adding a dependency with OS mentioned in an artifact name (`darwin`, `mac`, `osx`, `linux`, `windows`), remember to add them to \n  `implicitDependencies` configuration or update `resolveDependencies` task if needed. `resolveDependencies` should resolve all dependencies\n  including dependencies for different platforms.\n- If you have a `local.properties` file in your Kotlin project folder, make sure that it doesn't contain `kotlin.native.enabled=false`.\n  Otherwise, native-only dependencies may not be added to the verification metadata. This is because `local.properties` has higher \n  precedence than the `-Pkotlin.native.enabled=true` specified in the Gradle command.\n\n## Using -dev versions\n\nWe publish `-dev` versions frequently.\n\nFor `-dev` versions you can use the [list of available versions](https://redirector.kotlinlang.org/maven/bootstrap/org/jetbrains/kotlin/kotlin-compiler/maven-metadata.xml) and include this maven repository:\n\n```kotlin\nmaven(\"https://redirector.kotlinlang.org/maven/bootstrap\")\n```\n\n# License\nKotlin is distributed under the terms of the Apache License (Version 2.0).

      "readme": "# SwiftLint\n\nA tool to enforce Swift style and conventions, loosely based on the now\narchived [GitHub Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide).\nSwiftLint enforces the style guide rules that are generally accepted by the\nSwift community. These rules are well described in popular style guides like\n[Kodeco's Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/kodecocodes/swift-style-guide).\n\nSwiftLint rules are predominantly based on [SwiftSyntax](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax).\nSome rules still hook into [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org) and\n[SourceKit](http://www.jpsim.com/uncovering-sourcekit) to access type information.\n\n[![Supported Swift Versions](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fswiftpackageindex.com%2Fapi%2Fpackages%2Frealm%2FSwiftLint%2Fbadge%3Ftype%3Dswift-versions)](https://swiftpackageindex.com/realm/SwiftLint)\n[![Supported Platforms](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fswiftpackageindex.com%2Fapi%2Fpackages%2Frealm%2FSwiftLint%2Fbadge%3Ftype%3Dplatforms)](https://swiftpackageindex.com/realm/SwiftLint)\n[![Buildkite Build Status](https://badge.buildkite.com/e2a5bc32c347e76e2793e4c5764a5f42bcd42bbe32f79c3a53.svg?branch=main)](https://buildkite.com/swiftlint/swiftlint)\n\n![SwiftLint violations highlighted in the Xcode editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realm/SwiftLint/main/assets/screenshot.png)\n\nThis project adheres to the\n[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://realm.io/conduct).\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code.\n\n> Switch Language:\n> [中文](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/main/README_CN.md),\n> [한국어](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/main/README_KR.md)\n\n## Video Introduction\n\nTo get a high-level overview of SwiftLint, we encourage you to watch this\npresentation recorded January 9th, 2017 by JP Simard (transcript provided):\n\n[![Presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realm/SwiftLint/main/assets/presentation.svg)](https://youtu.be/9Z1nTMTejqU)\n\n## Installation\n\n### [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)\n\nSwiftLint can be used as a [command plugin](#swift-package-command-plugin)\nor a [build tool plugin](#build-tool-plugins).\n\nAdd\n\n```swift\n.package(url: \"https://github.com/SimplyDanny/SwiftLintPlugins\", from: \"<version>\")\n```\n\nto your `Package.swift` file to consume the latest release of SwiftLint\nautomatically or pin the dependency to a specific version:\n\n```swift\n.package(url: \"https://github.com/SimplyDanny/SwiftLintPlugins\", exact: \"<version>\")\n```\n\nTherein, replace `<version>` with the desired minimum or exact version.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Consuming the plugins directly from the SwiftLint repository comes\n> with several drawbacks. To avoid them and reduce the overhead imposed, it's\n> highly recommended to consume the plugins from the dedicated\n> [SwiftLintPlugins repository](https://github.com/SimplyDanny/SwiftLintPlugins),\n> even though plugins from the SwiftLint repository are also absolutely\n> functional. If the plugins from SwiftLint are preferred, just use the URL\n> `https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint` in the package declarations above.\n>\n> However, [SwiftLintPlugins](https://github.com/SimplyDanny/SwiftLintPlugins)\n> facilitates plugin adoption massively. It lists some of the reasons that\n> drive the plugins as provided by SwiftLint itself very troublesome. Since\n> the plugin code and the releases are kept in sync, there is no difference\n> in functionality between the two, but you spare yourself a lot of time and\n> trouble using the dedicated plugins repository.\n>\n> This document assumes you're relying on SwiftLintPlugins.\n\n### [Xcode Package Dependency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app)\n\nUse the following link to add SwiftLint as a Package Dependency to an Xcode\nproject:\n\n```bash\nhttps://github.com/SimplyDanny/SwiftLintPlugins\n```\n\n### [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)\n\n```bash\nbrew install swiftlint\n```\n\n### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)\n\nAdd the following to your `Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\npod 'SwiftLint'\n```\n\nThis will download the SwiftLint binaries and dependencies in `Pods/` during\nyour next `pod install` execution and will allow you to invoke it via\n`${PODS_ROOT}/SwiftLint/swiftlint` in your Script Build Phases.\n\nInstalling via Cocoapods also enables pinning to a specific version of\nSwiftLint rather than simply the latest (which is the case with\n[Homebrew](#homebrew)).\n\nNote that this will add the SwiftLint binaries, its dependencies' binaries, and\nthe Swift binary library distribution to the `Pods/` directory, so checking in\nthis directory to SCM such as Git is discouraged.\n\n### [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint)\n\n```bash\nmint install realm/SwiftLint\n```\n\n### [Bazel](https://bazel.build)\n\nPut this in your `MODULE.bazel`:\n\n```bzl\nbazel_dep(name = \"swiftlint\", version = \"0.52.4\", repo_name = \"SwiftLint\")\n```\n\nOr put this in your `WORKSPACE`:\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>WORKSPACE</summary>\n\n```bzl\nload(\"@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl\", \"http_archive\")\n\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"build_bazel_rules_apple\",\n    sha256 = \"390841dd5f8a85fc25776684f4793d56e21b098dfd7243cd145b9831e6ef8be6\",\n    url = \"https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/releases/download/2.4.1/rules_apple.2.4.1.tar.gz\",\n)\n\nload(\n    \"@build_bazel_rules_apple//apple:repositories.bzl\",\n    \"apple_rules_dependencies\",\n)\n\napple_rules_dependencies()\n\nload(\n    \"@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:repositories.bzl\",\n    \"swift_rules_dependencies\",\n)\n\nswift_rules_dependencies()\n\nload(\n    \"@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:extras.bzl\",\n    \"swift_rules_extra_dependencies\",\n)\n\nswift_rules_extra_dependencies()\n\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"SwiftLint\",\n    sha256 = \"c6ea58b9c72082cdc1ada4a2d48273ecc355896ed72204cedcc586b6ccb8aca6\",\n    url = \"https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/releases/download/0.52.4/bazel.tar.gz\",\n)\n\nload(\"@SwiftLint//bazel:repos.bzl\", \"swiftlint_repos\")\n\nswiftlint_repos()\n\nload(\"@SwiftLint//bazel:deps.bzl\", \"swiftlint_deps\")\n\nswiftlint_deps()\n```\n\n</details>\n\nThen you can run SwiftLint in the current directory with this command:\n\n```console\nbazel run -c opt @SwiftLint//:swiftlint\n```\n\n### Pre-Built Package\n\nDownload `SwiftLint.pkg` from the\n[latest GitHub release](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/releases/latest) and\nrun it.\n\n### From Source\n\nMake sure the build tool [Bazel](https://bazel.build) and a\nrecent [Swift toolchain](https://www.swift.org/download/) are\ninstalled and all tools are discoverable in your `PATH`.\n\nTo build SwiftLint, clone this repository and run `make install`.\n\n## Setup\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> While it may seem intuitive to run SwiftLint before compiling Swift source\n> files to exit a build early when there are lint violations, it is important\n> to understand that SwiftLint is designed to analyze valid source code that\n> is compilable. Non-compiling code can very easily lead to unexpected and\n> confusing results, especially when executing with `--fix`/`--autocorrect`\n> command line arguments.\n\n### Build Tool Plugins\n\nSwiftLint can be used as a build tool plugin for both\n[Swift Package projects](#swift-package-projects)\nand [Xcode projects](#xcode-projects).\n\nThe build tool plugin determines the SwiftLint working directory by locating\nthe topmost config file within the package/project directory. If a config file\nis not found therein, the package/project directory is used as the working\ndirectory.\n\nThe plugin throws an error when it is unable to resolve the SwiftLint working\ndirectory. For example, this will occur in Xcode projects where the target's\nSwift files are not located within the project directory.\n\nTo maximize compatibility with the plugin, avoid project structures that require\nthe use of the `--config` option.\n\n### Swift Package Projects\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Requires installing via [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager).\n\nBuild tool plugins run when building each target. When a project has multiple\ntargets, the plugin must be added to the desired targets individually.\n\nTo do this, add the plugin to the target(s) to be linted as follows:\n\n```swift\n.target(\n    ...\n    plugins: [.plugin(name: \"SwiftLintBuildToolPlugin\", package: \"SwiftLintPlugins\")]\n),\n```\n\n### Swift Package Command Plugin\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Requires installing via [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager).\n\nThe command plugin enables running SwiftLint from the command line as follows:\n\n```shell\nswift package plugin swiftlint\n```\n\n### Xcode Projects\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Requires installing via [Xcode Package Dependency](#xcode-package-dependency).\n\nBuild tool plugins run as a build phase of each target. When a project has\nmultiple targets, the plugin must be added to the desired targets individually.\n\nTo do this, add the `SwiftLintBuildToolPlugin` to the `Run Build Tool Plug-ins`\nphase of the `Build Phases` for the target(s) to be linted.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> When using the plugin for the first time, be sure to trust and enable\n> it when prompted. If a macros build warning exists, select it to trust\n> and enable the macros as well.\n\nFor unattended use (e.g. on CI), package plugin and macro\nvalidations can be disabled with either of the following:\n\n* Using `xcodebuild` options:\n\n  ```bash\n  -skipPackagePluginValidation\n  -skipMacroValidation\n  ```\n\n* Setting Xcode defaults:\n\n  ```bash\n  defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDESkipPackagePluginFingerprintValidatation -bool YES\n  defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode IDESkipMacroFingerprintValidation -bool YES\n  ```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The unattended use options bypass Xcode's validation dialogs\n> and implicitly trust all plugins and macros, which has security implications.\n\n#### Unexpected Xcode Project Structures\n\nProject structures where SwiftLint's configuration file is located\noutside of the package/project directory are not directly supported\nby the build tool plugin. This is because it isn't possible to pass\narguments to build tool plugins (e.g., passing the config file path).\n\nIf your project structure doesn't work directly with the build tool\nplugin, please consider one of the following options:\n\n* To use a config file located outside the package/project directory, a config\n  file may be added to that directory specifying a parent config path to the\n  other config file, e.g., `parent_config: path/to/.swiftlint.yml`.\n* You can also consider the use of a\n  [Run Script Build Phase](#xcode-run-script-build-phase) in place of the build\n  tool plugin.\n\n### Xcode Run Script Build Phase\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Based upon the installation method used, the shell command syntax in the\n> Run Script Build Phase may be different or additional configuration could\n> be required. Refer to the [installation](#installation) instructions for\n> more information.\n\nIf the build tool plugin does not work for your project setup or when\nadditional custom setup is required, SwiftLint can be added as a Run Script\nBuild Phase. This is useful when a project setup relies on the `--config`\nSwiftLint option; or to lint all targets together in a single `swiftlint`\ninvocation. File inclusions and exclusions can be configured in the\n[`.swiftlint.yml` configuration](#configuration).\n\nTo do this, add a custom script to a `Run Script` phase of the `Build Phases`\nof the primary app target, after the `Compile Sources` phase. Use the\nfollowing script implementation:\n\n```bash\nif command -v swiftlint >/dev/null 2>&1\nthen\n    swiftlint\nelse\n    echo \"warning: `swiftlint` command not found - See https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation for installation instructions.\"\nfi\n```\n\nIf you're using the SwiftLintPlugin in a Swift package,\nyou may refer to the `swiftlint` executable in the\nfollowing way:\n\n```bash\nSWIFT_PACKAGE_DIR=\"${BUILD_DIR%Build/*}SourcePackages/artifacts\"\nSWIFTLINT_CMD=\"$SWIFT_PACKAGE_DIR/swiftlintplugins/SwiftLintBinary/SwiftLintBinary.artifactbundle/macos/swiftlint\"\n\nif test -f \"$SWIFTLINT_CMD\" 2>&1\nthen\n    \"$SWIFTLINT_CMD\"\nelse\n    echo \"warning: `swiftlint` command not found - See https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#xcode-run-script-build-phase for installation instructions.\"\nfi\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `SWIFTLINT_CMD` path uses the default Xcode configuration and has been\n> tested on Xcode 15/16. In case of another configuration (e.g. a custom\n> Swift package path), please adapt the values accordingly.\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->\n> [!TIP]\n> Uncheck `Based on dependency analysis` to run `swiftlint` on all incremental\n> builds, suppressing the unspecified outputs warning.\n\n#### Consideration for Xcode 15.0\n\nXcode 15 made a significant change by setting the default value of the\n`ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING` build setting from `NO` to `YES`.\nAs a result, SwiftLint encounters an error related to missing file permissions,\nwhich typically manifests as\n`error: Sandbox: swiftlint(19427) deny(1) file-read-data.`\n\nTo resolve this issue, it is necessary to manually set the\n`ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING` setting to `NO` for the specific target that\nSwiftLint is being configured for.\n\n#### Consideration for Apple Silicon\n\nIf you installed SwiftLint via Homebrew on Apple Silicon, you might experience\nthis warning:\n\n```bash\nwarning: SwiftLint not installed, download from https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint\n```\n\nThat is because Homebrew on Apple Silicon installs the binaries into the\n`/opt/homebrew/bin` folder by default. To instruct Xcode where to find\nSwiftLint, you can either add `/opt/homebrew/bin` to the `PATH` environment\nvariable in your build phase:\n\n```bash\nif [[ \"$(uname -m)\" == arm64 ]]\nthen\n    export PATH=\"/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nif command -v swiftlint >/dev/null 2>&1\nthen\n    swiftlint\nelse\n    echo \"warning: `swiftlint` command not found - See https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation for installation instructions.\"\nfi\n```\n\nor you can create a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin` pointing to the actual\nbinary:\n\n```bash\nln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/swiftlint /usr/local/bin/swiftlint\n```\n\n#### Additional Considerations\n\nIf you wish to fix violations as well, your script could run\n`swiftlint --fix && swiftlint` instead of just `swiftlint`. This will mean\nthat all correctable violations are fixed while ensuring warnings show up in\nyour project for remaining violations.\n\nIf you've installed SwiftLint via CocoaPods the script should look like this:\n\n```bash\n\"${PODS_ROOT}/SwiftLint/swiftlint\"\n```\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n\nTo integrate SwiftLint with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), install the\n[`vscode-swiftlint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swiftlint)\nextension from the marketplace.\n\n### Fastlane\n\nYou can use the official\n[`swiftlint` fastlane action](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/swiftlint)\nto run SwiftLint as part of your fastlane process.\n\n```ruby\nswiftlint(\n    mode: :lint,                            # SwiftLint mode: :lint (default) or :autocorrect\n    executable: \"Pods/SwiftLint/swiftlint\", # The SwiftLint binary path (optional). Important if you've installed it via CocoaPods\n    path: \"/path/to/lint\",                  # Specify path to lint (optional)\n    output_file: \"swiftlint.result.json\",   # The path of the output file (optional)\n    reporter: \"json\",                       # The custom reporter to use (optional)\n    config_file: \".swiftlint-ci.yml\",       # The path of the configuration file (optional)\n    files: [                                # List of files to process (optional)\n        \"AppDelegate.swift\",\n        \"path/to/project/Model.swift\"\n    ],\n    ignore_exit_status: true,               # Allow fastlane to continue even if SwiftLint returns a non-zero exit status (Default: false)\n    quiet: true,                            # Don't print status logs like 'Linting ' & 'Done linting' (Default: false)\n    strict: true                            # Fail on warnings? (Default: false)\n)\n```\n\n### Docker\n\nSwiftLint is also available as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image using\n`Ubuntu`. So just the first time you need to pull the docker image using the\nnext command:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull ghcr.io/realm/swiftlint:latest\n```\n\nThen following times, you just run `swiftlint` inside of the docker like:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` ghcr.io/realm/swiftlint:latest\n```\n\nThis will execute `swiftlint` in the folder where you are right now (`pwd`),\nshowing an output like:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` ghcr.io/realm/swiftlint:latest\nLinting Swift files in current working directory\nLinting 'RuleDocumentation.swift' (1/490)\n...\nLinting 'YamlSwiftLintTests.swift' (490/490)\nDone linting! Found 0 violations, 0 serious in 490 files.\n```\n\nHere you have more documentation about the usage of\n[Docker Images](https://docs.docker.com/).\n\n## Command Line Usage\n\n```txt\n$ swiftlint help\nOVERVIEW: A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions.\n\nUSAGE: swiftlint <subcommand>\n\nOPTIONS:\n  --version               Show the version.\n  -h, --help              Show help information.\n\nSUBCOMMANDS:\n  analyze                 Run analysis rules\n  docs                    Open SwiftLint documentation website in the default web browser\n  generate-docs           Generates markdown documentation for selected group of rules\n  lint (default)          Print lint warnings and errors\n  baseline                Operations on existing baselines\n  reporters               Display the list of reporters and their identifiers\n  rules                   Display the list of rules and their identifiers\n  version                 Display the current version of SwiftLint\n\n  See 'swiftlint help <subcommand>' for detailed help.\n```\n\nRun `swiftlint` in the directory containing the Swift files to lint. Directories\nwill be searched recursively.\n\nTo specify a list of files when using `lint` or `analyze`\n(like the list of files modified by Xcode specified by the\n[`ExtraBuildPhase`](https://github.com/norio-nomura/ExtraBuildPhase) Xcode\nplugin, or modified files in the working tree based on `git ls-files -m`), you\ncan do so by passing the option `--use-script-input-files` and setting the\nfollowing instance variables: `SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_COUNT`\nand `SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_0`, `SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_1`, ...,\n`SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_{SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_COUNT - 1}`.\nSimilarly, files can be read from file lists by passing\nthe option `--use-script-input-file-lists` and setting the\nfollowing instance variables: `SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_LIST_COUNT`\nand `SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_LIST_0`, `SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_LIST_1`, ...,\n`SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_LIST_{SCRIPT_INPUT_FILE_LIST_COUNT - 1}`.\n\nThese are same environment variables set for input files to\n[custom Xcode script phases](http://indiestack.com/2014/12/speeding-up-custom-script-phases/).\n\n## Working With Multiple Swift Versions\n\nSwiftLint hooks into SourceKit so it continues working even as Swift evolves!\n\nThis also keeps SwiftLint lean, as it doesn't need to ship with a full Swift\ncompiler, it just communicates with the official one you already have installed\non your machine.\n\nYou should always run SwiftLint with the same toolchain you use to compile your\ncode.\n\nYou may want to override SwiftLint's default Swift toolchain if you have\nmultiple toolchains or Xcodes installed.\n\nHere's the order in which SwiftLint determines which Swift toolchain to use:\n\n* `$XCODE_DEFAULT_TOOLCHAIN_OVERRIDE`\n* `$TOOLCHAIN_DIR` or `$TOOLCHAINS`\n* `xcrun -find swift`\n* `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`\n* `/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`\n* `~/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`\n* `~/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain`\n\n`sourcekitd.framework` is expected to be found in the `usr/lib/` subdirectory of\nthe value passed in the paths above.\n\nYou may also set the `TOOLCHAINS` environment variable to the reverse-DNS\nnotation that identifies a Swift toolchain version:\n\n```shell\nTOOLCHAINS=com.apple.dt.toolchain.Swift_2_3 swiftlint --fix\n```\n\nOn Linux, SourceKit is expected to be located in\n`/usr/lib/libsourcekitdInProc.so` or specified by the `LINUX_SOURCEKIT_LIB_PATH`\nenvironment variable.\n\n## Git `pre-commit` Hook\n\nSwiftLint can be run as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook.\nOnce [installed](https://pre-commit.com/#install), add this to the\n`.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root of your repository:\n\n```yaml\nrepos:\n  - repo: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint\n    rev: 0.57.1\n    hooks:\n      - id: swiftlint\n```\n\nAdjust `rev` to the SwiftLint version of your choice.  `pre-commit autoupdate`\ncan be used to update to the current version.\n\nSwiftLint can be configured using `entry` to apply fixes and fail on errors:\n\n```yaml\n-   repo: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint\n    rev: 0.57.1\n    hooks:\n    -   id: swiftlint\n        entry: swiftlint --fix --strict\n```\n\n## Rules\n\nOver 200 rules are included in SwiftLint and the Swift community (that's you!)\ncontinues to contribute more over time.\n[Pull requests](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nare encouraged.\n\nYou can find an updated list of rules and more information about them in the\n[Rule Directory](https://realm.github.io/SwiftLint/rule-directory.html).\n\nYou can also check the\n[Source/SwiftLintBuiltInRules/Rules](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/tree/main/Source/SwiftLintBuiltInRules/Rules)\ndirectory to see their implementation.\n\n### Opt-In Rules\n\n`opt_in_rules` are disabled by default (i.e., you have to explicitly enable them\nin your configuration file).\n\nGuidelines on when to mark a rule as opt-in:\n\n* A rule that can have many false positives (e.g. `empty_count`)\n* A rule that is too slow\n* A rule that is not general consensus or is only useful in some cases\n  (e.g. `force_unwrapping`)\n\n### Disable rules in code\n\nRules can be disabled with a comment inside a source file with the following\nformat:\n\n`// swiftlint:disable <rule1> [<rule2> <rule3>...]`\n\nThe rules will be disabled until the end of the file or until the linter sees a\nmatching enable comment:\n\n`// swiftlint:enable <rule1> [<rule2> <rule3>...]`\n\nFor example:\n\n```swift\n// swiftlint:disable colon\nlet noWarning :String = \"\" // No warning about colons immediately after variable names!\n// swiftlint:enable colon\nlet hasWarning :String = \"\" // Warning generated about colons immediately after variable names\n```\n\nIncluding the `all` keyword will disable all rules until the linter sees a\nmatching enable comment:\n\n`// swiftlint:disable all`\n`// swiftlint:enable all`\n\nFor example:\n\n```swift\n// swiftlint:disable all\nlet noWarning :String = \"\" // No warning about colons immediately after variable names!\nlet i = \"\" // Also no warning about short identifier names\n// swiftlint:enable all\nlet hasWarning :String = \"\" // Warning generated about colons immediately after variable names\nlet y = \"\" // Warning generated about short identifier names\n```\n\nIt's also possible to modify a `disable` or `enable` command by appending\n`:previous`, `:this` or `:next` for only applying the command to the previous,\nthis (current) or next line respectively.\n\nFor example:\n\n```swift\n// swiftlint:disable:next force_cast\nlet noWarning = NSNumber() as! Int\nlet hasWarning = NSNumber() as! Int\nlet noWarning2 = NSNumber() as! Int // swiftlint:disable:this force_cast\nlet noWarning3 = NSNumber() as! Int\n// swiftlint:disable:previous force_cast\n```\n\nRun `swiftlint rules` to print a list of all available rules and their\nidentifiers.\n\n### Configuration\n\nConfigure SwiftLint by adding a `.swiftlint.yml` file from the directory you'll\nrun SwiftLint from. The following parameters can be configured:\n\nRule inclusion:\n\n* `disabled_rules`: Disable rules from the default enabled set.\n* `opt_in_rules`: Enable rules that are not part of the default set. The\n   special `all` identifier will enable all opt in linter rules, except the ones\n   listed in `disabled_rules`.\n* `only_rules`: Only the rules specified in this list will be enabled.\n   Cannot be specified alongside `disabled_rules` or `opt_in_rules`.\n* `analyzer_rules`: This is an entirely separate list of rules that are only\n  run by the `analyze` command. All analyzer rules are opt-in, so this is the\n  only configurable rule list, there are no equivalents for `disabled_rules`\n  and `only_rules`. The special `all` identifier can also be used here to enable\n  all analyzer rules, except the ones listed in `disabled_rules`.\n\n```yaml\n# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:\ndisabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running\n  - colon\n  - comma\n  - control_statement\nopt_in_rules: # some rules are turned off by default, so you need to opt-in\n  - empty_count # find all the available rules by running: `swiftlint rules`\n\n# Alternatively, specify all rules explicitly by uncommenting this option:\n# only_rules: # delete `disabled_rules` & `opt_in_rules` if using this\n#   - empty_parameters\n#   - vertical_whitespace\n\nanalyzer_rules: # rules run by `swiftlint analyze`\n  - explicit_self\n\n# Case-sensitive paths to include during linting.

Swift Custom Rules\n\nThese rules are written the same way as the Swift-based rules that ship with\nSwiftLint so they're fast, accurate, can leverage SwiftSyntax, can be unit\ntested, and more.\n\nUsing these requires building SwiftLint with Bazel as described in\n[this video](https://vimeo.com/820572803) or its associated code in\n[github.com/jpsim/swiftlint-bazel-example](https://github.com/jpsim/swiftlint-bazel-example).\n\n#### 2. Regex Custom Rules\n\nYou can define custom regex-based rules in your configuration file using the\nfollowing syntax:\n\n```yaml\ncustom_rules:\n  pirates_beat_ninjas: # rule identifier\n    included:\n      - \".*\\\\.swift\" # regex that defines paths to include during linting. optional.\n    excluded:\n      - \".*Test\\\\.swift\" # regex that defines paths to exclude during linting. optional\n    name: \"Pirates Beat Ninjas\" # rule name. optional.\n    regex: \"([nN]inja)\" # matching pattern\n    capture_group: 0 # number of regex capture group to highlight the rule violation at. optional.\n    match_kinds: # SyntaxKinds to match. optional.\n      - comment\n      - identifier\n    message: \"Pirates are better than ninjas.\" # violation message. optional.\n    severity: error # violation severity. optional.\n  no_hiding_in_strings:\n    regex: \"([nN]inja)\"\n    match_kinds: string\n```\n\nThis is what the output would look like:\n\n![Custom violations highlighted in the Xcode editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realm/SwiftLint/main/assets/custom-rule.png)\n\nIt is important to note that the regular expression pattern is used with the\nflags `s` and `m` enabled, that is `.`\n[matches newlines](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression/options/1412529-dotmatcheslineseparators)\nand `^`/`$`\n[match the start and end of lines](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsregularexpression/options/1408263-anchorsmatchlines),\nrespectively. If you do not want to have `.` match newlines, for example, the\nregex can be prepended by `(?-s)`.\n\nYou can filter the matches by providing one or more `match_kinds`, which will\nreject matches that include syntax kinds that are not present in this list. Here\nare all the possible syntax kinds:\n\n* `argument`\n* `attribute.builtin`\n* `attribute.id`\n* `buildconfig.id`\n* `buildconfig.keyword`\n* `comment`\n* `comment.mark`\n* `comment.url`\n* `doccomment`\n* `doccomment.field`\n* `identifier`\n* `keyword`\n* `number`\n* `objectliteral`\n* `parameter`\n* `placeholder`\n* `string`\n* `string_interpolation_anchor`\n* `typeidentifier`\n\nAll syntax kinds used in a snippet of Swift code can be extracted asking\n[SourceKitten](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten). For example,\n`sourcekitten syntax --text \"struct S {}\"` delivers\n\n* `source.lang.swift.syntaxtype.keyword` for the `struct` keyword and\n* `source.lang.swift.syntaxtype.identifier` for its name `S`\n\nwhich match to `keyword` and `identifier` in the above list.\n\nIf using custom rules in combination with `only_rules`, you must include the\nliteral string `custom_rules` in the `only_rules` list:\n\n```yaml\nonly_rules:\n  - custom_rules\n\ncustom_rules:\n  no_hiding_in_strings:\n    regex: \"([nN]inja)\"\n    match_kinds: string\n```\n\nUnlike Swift custom rules, you can use official SwiftLint builds\n(e.g. from Homebrew) to run regex custom rules.\n\n### Auto-correct\n\nSwiftLint can automatically correct certain violations. Files on disk are\noverwritten with a corrected version.\n\nPlease make sure to have backups of these files before running\n`swiftlint --fix`, otherwise important data may be lost.\n\nStandard linting is disabled while correcting because of the high likelihood of\nviolations (or their offsets) being incorrect after modifying a file while\napplying corrections.\n\n### Analyze\n\nThe `swiftlint analyze` command can lint Swift files using the\nfull type-checked AST. The compiler log path containing the clean `swiftc` build\ncommand invocation (incremental builds will fail) must be passed to `analyze`\nvia the `--compiler-log-path` flag.\ne.g. `--compiler-log-path /path/to/xcodebuild.log`\n\nThis can be obtained by\n\n1. Cleaning DerivedData (incremental builds won't work with analyze)\n2. Running `xcodebuild -workspace {WORKSPACE}.xcworkspace -scheme {SCHEME} > xcodebuild.log`\n3. Running `swiftlint analyze --compiler-log-path xcodebuild.log`\n\nAnalyzer rules tend to be considerably slower than lint rules.\n\n## Using Multiple Configuration Files\n\nSwiftLint offers a variety of ways to include multiple configuration files.\nMultiple configuration files get merged into one single configuration that is\nthen applied just as a single configuration file would get applied.\n\nThere are quite a lot of use cases where using multiple configuration files\ncould be helpful:\n\nFor instance, one could use a team-wide shared SwiftLint configuration while\nallowing overrides in each project via a child configuration file.\n\nTeam-Wide Configuration:\n\n```yaml\ndisabled_rules:\n- force_cast\n```\n\nProject-Specific Configuration:\n\n```yaml\nopt_in_rules:\n- force_cast\n```\n\n### Child/Parent Configs (Locally)\n\nYou can specify a `child_config` and/or a `parent_config` reference within a\nconfiguration file. These references should be local paths relative to the\nfolder of the configuration file they are specified in. This even works\nrecursively, as long as there are no cycles and no ambiguities.\n\n**A child config is treated as a refinement and thus has a higher priority**,\nwhile a parent config is considered a base with lower priority in case of\nconflicts.\n\nHere's an example, assuming you have the following file structure:\n\n```txt\nProjectRoot\n    |_ .swiftlint.yml\n    |_ .swiftlint_refinement.yml\n    |_ Base\n        |_ .swiftlint_base.yml\n```\n\nTo include both the refinement and the base file, your `.swiftlint.yml` should\nlook like this:\n\n```yaml\nchild_config: .swiftlint_refinement.yml\nparent_config: Base/.swiftlint_base.yml\n```\n\nWhen merging parent and child configs, `included` and `excluded` configurations\nare processed carefully to account for differences in the directory location\nof the containing configuration files.\n\n### Child/Parent Configs (Remote)\n\nJust as you can provide local `child_config`/`parent_config` references,\ninstead of referencing local paths, you can just put urls that lead to\nconfiguration files. In order for SwiftLint to detect these remote references,\nthey must start with `http://` or `https://`.\n\nThe referenced remote configuration files may even recursively reference other\nremote configuration files, but aren't allowed to include local references.\n\nUsing a remote reference, your `.swiftlint.yml` could look like this:\n\n```yaml\nparent_config: https://myteamserver.com/our-base-swiftlint-config.yml\n```\n\nEvery time you run SwiftLint and have an Internet connection, SwiftLint tries\nto get a new version of every remote configuration that is referenced. If this\nrequest times out, a cached version is used if available. If there is no cached\nversion available, SwiftLint fails – but no worries, a cached version should be\nthere once SwiftLint has run successfully at least once.\n\nIf needed, the timeouts for the remote configuration fetching can be specified\nmanually via the configuration file(s) using the\n`remote_timeout`/`remote_timeout_if_cached` specifiers. These values default\nto 2 seconds or 1 second, respectively.\n\n### Command Line\n\nInstead of just providing one configuration file when running SwiftLint via the\ncommand line, you can also pass a hierarchy, where the first configuration is\ntreated as a parent, while the last one is treated as the highest-priority\nchild.\n\nA simple example including just two configuration files looks like this:\n\n`swiftlint --config .swiftlint.yml --config .swiftlint_child.yml`\n\n### Nested Configurations\n\nIn addition to a main configuration (the `.swiftlint.yml` file in the root\nfolder), you can put other configuration files named `.swiftlint.yml` into the\ndirectory structure that then get merged as a child config, but only with an\neffect for those files that are within the same directory as the config or in a\ndeeper directory where there isn't another configuration file. In other words:\nNested configurations don't work recursively – there's a maximum number of one\nnested configuration per file that may be applied in addition to the main\nconfiguration.\n\n`.swiftlint.yml` files are only considered as a nested configuration if they\nhave not been used to build the main configuration already (e. g. by having\nbeen referenced via something like `child_config: Folder/.swiftlint.yml`).\nAlso, `parent_config`/`child_config` specifications of nested configurations\nare getting ignored because there's no sense to that.\n\nIf one (or more) SwiftLint file(s) are explicitly specified via the `--config`\nparameter, that configuration will be treated as an override, no matter whether\nthere exist other `.swiftlint.yml` files somewhere within the directory.\n**So if you want to use nested configurations, you can't use the `--config`\nparameter.**\n\n## License\n\n[MIT licensed.](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\n## About\n\nSwiftLint is utterly maintained by volunteers contributing to its success\nentirely in their free time.

Since then, we’ve been updating both apps to give\nusers the same solid experience, so it’s normal to notice that K-9 Mail and Thunderbird look and\nfeel nearly identical. They’re built on the same code, and that’s intentional. You'll notice some\nfeatures are selectively enabled for Thunderbird as opposed to K-9 Mail, usually when they are\nsimply a better fit for Thunderbird (like the import from K-9 functionality).\n\nIf you prefer the robot dog and would like to keep K-9 Mail around, you can find it here:\n\n- [K-9 Mail on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsck.k9&utm_source=thunderbird-android-github&utm_campaign=download-section)\n- [K-9 Mail on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.fsck.k9/)\n\n## Forking\n\nIf you want to use a fork of this project please ensure that you replace the OAuth client setup in the `app-k9mail/src/{debug,release}/kotlin/app/k9mail/auth/K9OAuthConfigurationFactory.kt` and `app-thunderbird/src/{debug,daily,beta,release}/kotlin/net/thunderbird/android/auth/TbOAuthConfigurationFactory.kt` with your own OAuth client setup and ensure that the `redirectUri` is different to the one used in the main project. This is to prevent conflicts with the main app when both are installed on the same device.\n\n## License\n\nThunderbird for Android is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE).\n",

It has a highly extensible backend that enables you to\nbuild a control plane that can orchestrate applications and infrastructure no\nmatter where they run, and a highly configurable frontend that puts you in\ncontrol of the schema of the declarative API it offers.\n\nCrossplane is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation][cncf] project.\n\n## Get Started\n\nCrossplane's [Get Started Docs] covers install and resource quickstarts.\n\n## Releases\n\n[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/crossplane/crossplane/all.svg)](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/releases) [![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/crossplane)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/crossplane/crossplane)\n\nCurrently maintained releases, as well as the next few upcoming releases are\nlisted below. For more information take a look at the Crossplane [release cycle\ndocumentation].\n\n| Release | Release Date  |   EOL    |\n|:-------:|:-------------:|:--------:|\n|  v1.20  | May 21, 2025  | Feb 2026 |\n|  v2.0   |  Aug 8, 2025  | May 2026 |\n|  v2.1   |  Nov 5, 2025  | Aug 2026 |\n|  v2.2   | Early Feb '26 | Nov 2026 |\n|  v2.3   | Early May '26 | Feb 2027 |\n|  v2.4   | Early Aug '26 | May 2027 |\n\nYou can subscribe to the [community calendar] to track all release dates, and\nfind the most recent releases on the [releases] page.\n\nThe release process is fully documented in the [`crossplane/release`] repo.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe public roadmap for Crossplane is published as a GitHub project board. Issues\nadded to the roadmap have been triaged and identified as valuable to the\ncommunity, and therefore a priority for the project that we expect to invest in.\n\nThe maintainer team regularly triages requests from the community to identify\nfeatures and issues of suitable scope and impact to include in this roadmap. The\ncommunity is encouraged to show their support for potential roadmap issues by\nadding a :+1: reaction, leaving descriptive comments, and attending the\n[regular community meetings] to discuss their requirements and use cases.\n\nThe maintainer team updates the roadmap on an as needed basis, in response to\ndemand, priority, and available resources. The public roadmap can be updated at\nany time.\n\nMilestones assigned to any issues in the roadmap are intended to give a sense of\noverall priority and the expected order of delivery. They should be considered\napproximate estimations and are **not** a strict commitment to a specific\ndelivery timeline.\n\n[Crossplane Roadmap]\n\n## Get Involved\n\n[![Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-crossplane-red?logo=slack)](https://slack.crossplane.io) [![Bluesky Follow](https://img.shields.io/badge/bluesky-Follow-blue?logo=bluesky)](https://bsky.app/profile/crossplane.io) [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/crossplane_io?logo=X&label=Follow&style=flat)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=crossplane_io&user_id=788180534543339520) [![YouTube Channel Subscribers](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UC19FgzMBMqBro361HbE46Fw)](https://www.youtube.com/@Crossplane)\n\nCrossplane is a community driven project; we welcome your contribution.

This is always UTC.\n\tUse \"time:iso\" to show the time with ISO-8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD\"T\"hh:mm:ss).\n\tUse \"time:off\" to remove time meta data.\n\tUse \"time:usec\" to add microseconds to date time meta data.\n\tUse \"time:tz\" to output time with timezone offset.\n\tUse \"time:utc\" to output time in UTC.\n\t\t(this may also be accomplished by invocation with TZ environment variable set).\n\t\t\"usec\" and \"utc\" can be combined with other options, eg. \"time:iso:utc\" or \"time:unix:usec\".\n\tUse \"replay[:N]\" to replay file inputs at (N-times) realtime.\n\tUse \"protocol\" / \"noprotocol\" to output the decoder protocol number meta data.\n\tUse \"level\" to add Modulation, Frequency, RSSI, SNR, and Noise meta data.\n\tUse \"noise[:<secs>]\" to report estimated noise level at intervals (default: 10 seconds).\n\tUse \"stats[:[<level>][:<interval>]]\" to report statistics (default: 600 seconds).\n\t  level 0: no report, 1: report successful devices, 2: report active devices, 3: report all\n\tUse \"bits\" to add bit representation to code outputs (for debug).\n\n\n\t\t= Read file option =\n  [-r <filename>] Read data from input file instead of a receiver\n\tParameters are detected from the full path, file name, and extension.\n\n\tA center frequency is detected as (fractional) number suffixed with 'M',\n\t'Hz', 'kHz', 'MHz', or 'GHz'.\n\n\tA sample rate is detected as (fractional) number suffixed with 'k',\n\t'sps', 'ksps', 'Msps', or 'Gsps'.\n\n\tFile content and format are detected as parameters, possible options are:\n\t'cu8', 'cs16', 'cf32' ('IQ' implied), and 'am.s16'.\n\n\tParameters must be separated by non-alphanumeric chars and are case-insensitive.\n\tOverrides can be prefixed, separated by colon (':')\n\n\tE.g. default detection by extension: path/filename.am.s16\n\tforced overrides: am:s16:path/filename.ext\n\n\tReading from pipes also support format options.\n\tE.g reading complex 32-bit float: CU32:-\n\n\n\t\t= Write file option =\n  [-w <filename>] Save data stream to output file (a '-' dumps samples to stdout)\n  [-W <filename>] Save data stream to output file, overwrite existing file\n\tParameters are detected from the full path, file name, and extension.\n\n\tFile content and format are detected as parameters, possible options are:\n\t'cu8', 'cs8', 'cs16', 'cf32' ('IQ' implied),\n\t'am.s16', 'am.f32', 'fm.s16', 'fm.f32',\n\t'i.f32', 'q.f32', 'logic.u8', 'ook', and 'vcd'.\n\n\tParameters must be separated by non-alphanumeric chars and are case-insensitive.\n\tOverrides can be prefixed, separated by colon (':')\n\n\tE.g. default detection by extension: path/filename.am.s16\n\tforced overrides: am:s16:path/filename.ext\n\n```\n\n\nSome examples:\n\n| Command | Description\n|---------|------------\n| `rtl_433` | Default receive mode, use the first device found, listen at 433.92 MHz at 250k sample rate.\n| `rtl_433 -C si` | Default receive mode, also convert units to metric system.\n| `rtl_433 -f 868M -s 1024k` | Listen at 868 MHz and 1024k sample rate.\n| `rtl_433 -M hires -M level` | Report microsecond accurate timestamps and add reception levels (depending on gain).\n| `rtl_433 -R 1 -R 8 -R 43` | Enable only specific decoders for desired devices.\n| `rtl_433 -A` | Enable pulse analyzer. Summarizes the timings of pulses, gaps, and periods. Can be used with `-R 0` to disable decoders.\n| `rtl_433 -S all -T 120` | Save all detected signals (`g###_###M_###k.cu8`). Run for 2 minutes.\n| `rtl_433 -K FILE -r file_name` | Read a saved data file instead of receiving live data. Tag output with filenames.\n| `rtl_433 -F json -M utc \\| mosquitto_pub -t home/rtl_433 -l` | Will pipe the output to network as JSON formatted MQTT messages. A test MQTT client can be found in `examples/mqtt_rtl_433_test_client.py`.\n| `rtl_433 -f 433.53M -f 434.02M -H 15` | Will poll two frequencies with 15 seconds hop interval.\n\n## Security\n\nPlease note: We aim to make `rtl_433` safe to use, but it should not be assumed secure.\nThere is no reason to e.g. run with `sudo`, we do read and write files without any checks.\n\nThe output is literally pulled from thin air, it's not to be trusted.\nIf you feed downstream systems with data make sure edge cases are checked and handled.\nNetwork inputs and outputs are for use in a trusted local network, will contain unfiltered data, and might overload the recipient\n(know that e.g. the MQTT output can be controlled by anyone with a radio sender).\n\n## Google Group\n\nJoin the Google group, rtl_433, for more information about rtl_433:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rtl_433\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you see this error:\n\n    Kernel driver is active, or device is claimed by second instance of librtlsdr.\n    In the first case, please either detach or blacklist the kernel module\n    (dvb_usb_rtl28xxu), or enable automatic detaching at compile time.\n\nthen\n\n    sudo rmmod rtl2832_sdr dvb_usb_rtl28xxu rtl2832\n\nor add\n\n    blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu\n\nto /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\n## Releases\n\nVersion numbering scheme used is year.month. We try to keep the API compatible between releases but focus is on maintainablity.\n",

Through an integrated platform that integrates with your toolchain and projects, we help you stay focused and productive while building apps.\n\nThe following solutions are part of Tuist:\n\n- [🗂️ **Generated projects**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/projects): A solution for more accessible and easier-to-manage Xcode projects.\n- [🚝 **Cache**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/cache): Speed up builds across environments with a content-addressable store.\n- [✅ **Selective testing**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/selective-testing): Run tests faster by selecting them based on the file changes.\n- [📦 **Registry**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/registry): Speed up the resolution of [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/)-indexed packages.\n- [📈 **Build insights**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/insights): Get actionable insights from your projects, builds, and test runs to make informed decisions.\n- [📱 **Bundle insights**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/develop/bundle-size): Analyze your built apps and get suggestions to improve them.\n- [📱 **Previews**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/features/previews): Sharing apps (previews) as easy as sharing a link.\n- [✅ **QA**](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/features/qa): QA your app using LLM-based agents.\n\nOpenness and community are cornerstones in shaping Tuist, as we believe they are the key to building the best solution. We recommend checking out the following resources:\n\n- [📑 **Documentation**](https://docs.tuist.dev)\n- [📚 **Handbook**](https://handbook.tuist.dev)\n- [💬 **Community forum**](https://community.tuist.dev)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Even though our current focus is on the development phase of Apple native apps, we'll gradually expand our focus to include other ecosystems (e.g., Android, RN, and Flutter), and expand beyond just development.\n\n## Get started\n\nYou can run the following command to get started with [Mise] (check out [this page](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/quick-start/get-started) for other methods):\n\n```bash\nmise x tuist@latest -- tuist init\n```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The `init` workflow is designed to integrate with an existing Xcode project or create [a generated project](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/features/projects). If you are migrating an existing Xcode project to a generated project, we recommend [checking out these docs](https://docs.tuist.dev/en/guides/features/projects/adoption/migrate/xcode-project).\n\n## Documentation\n\nDo you want to know more about what Tuist can offer you? Or perhaps want to contribute to the project and you need a starting point?\n\nYou can check out [the project documentation](https://docs.tuist.dev).\n\n### Sample projects\n\nYou can find some sample projects in the [examples folder](examples/xcode) or the [awesome Tuist repo](https://github.com/tuist/awesome-tuist)! 🎉\n\n## Development\n\nThis repository represents a monorepo with the following projects:\n\n| Project | Description |\n| ------ | -------  |\n| [cli](/cli) | The command line interface for Tuist |\n| [app](/app) | The Swift-powered iOS and macOS app |\n| [docs](/docs) | The documentation for Tuist |\n| [handbook](/handbook) | The company's handbook |\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSome companies support our community and open source efforts with contributions through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tuist) and [Open Collective Backers](https://opencollective.com/tuistapp).

Scalable from 8-bit to 64-bit\nmicrocontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are POSIX\nand ANSI standards. Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOSs\n(such as VxWorks) are adopted for functionality not available under these\nstandards, or for functionality that is not appropriate for deeply-embedded\nenvironments (such as fork()).\n\nFor brevity, many parts of the documentation will refer to Apache NuttX as simply NuttX.\n\n## Getting Started\nFirst time on NuttX? Read the [Getting Started](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/quickstart/index.html) guide!\nIf you don't have a board available, NuttX has its own simulator that you can run on terminal.\n\n## Documentation\nYou can find the current NuttX documentation on the [Documentation Page](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/).\n\nAlternatively, you can build the documentation yourself by following the Documentation Build [Instructions](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/documentation.html).\n\nThe old NuttX documentation is still available in the [Apache wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/NUTTX/NuttX).\n\n## Supported Boards\nNuttX supports a wide variety of platforms. See the full list on the [Supported Platforms](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/platforms/index.html) page.\n\n## Contributing\nIf you wish to contribute to the NuttX project, read the [Contributing](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/contributing/index.html) guidelines for information on Git usage, coding standard, workflow and the NuttX principles.\n\n## License\nThe code in this repository is under either the Apache 2 license, or a license compatible with the Apache 2 license.

      "readme": "> **📣 If you were previously using libsignal from Maven or Gradle, our repository location has changed with the 0.86.6 release. See below for more information.**\n\n# Overview\n\nlibsignal contains platform-agnostic APIs used by the official Signal clients and servers, exposed\nas a Java, Swift, or TypeScript library. The underlying implementations are written in Rust:\n\n- libsignal-protocol: Implements the Signal protocol, including the [Double Ratchet algorithm][]. A\n  replacement for [libsignal-protocol-java][] and [libsignal-metadata-java][].\n- signal-crypto: Cryptographic primitives such as AES-GCM. We use [RustCrypto][]'s where we can\n  but sometimes have differing needs.\n- device-transfer: Support logic for Signal's device-to-device transfer feature.\n- attest: Functionality for remote attestation of [SGX enclaves][] and server-side [HSMs][].\n- zkgroup: Functionality for [zero-knowledge groups][] and related features available in Signal.\n- zkcredential: An abstraction for the sort of zero-knowledge credentials used by zkgroup, based on the paper \"[The Signal Private Group System][]\" by Chase, Perrin, and Zaverucha.\n- poksho: Utilities for implementing zero-knowledge proofs (such as those used by zkgroup); stands for \"proof-of-knowledge, stateful-hash-object\".\n- account-keys: Functionality for consistently using [PINs][] as passwords in Signal's Secure Value Recovery system, as well as other account-wide key operations.\n- usernames: Functionality for username generation, hashing, and proofs.\n- media: Utilities for manipulating media.\n\nThis repository is used by the Signal client apps ([Android][], [iOS][], and [Desktop][]) as well as\nserver-side. Use outside of Signal is unsupported. In particular, the products of this repository\nare the Java, Swift, and TypeScript libraries that wrap the underlying Rust implementations. All\nAPIs and implementations are subject to change without notice, as are the JNI, C, and Node add-on\n\"bridge\" layers. However, backwards-incompatible changes to the Java, Swift, TypeScript, and\nnon-bridge Rust APIs will be reflected in the version number on a best-effort basis, including\nincreases to the minimum supported tools versions.\n\n[Double Ratchet algorithm]: https://signal.org/docs/\n[libsignal-protocol-java]: https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java\n[libsignal-metadata-java]: https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-metadata-java\n[RustCrypto]: https://github.com/RustCrypto\n[Noise protocol]: http://noiseprotocol.org/\n[SGX enclaves]: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/software-guard-extensions.html\n[HSMs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module\n[zero-knowledge groups]: https://signal.org/blog/signal-private-group-system/\n[The Signal Private Group System]: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1416.pdf\n[PINs]: https://signal.org/blog/signal-pins/\n[Android]: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android\n[iOS]: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS\n[Desktop]: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop\n\n\n# Building\n\n### Toolchain Installation\n\nTo build anything in this repository you must have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed,\nas well as Clang, libclang, [CMake](https://cmake.org), Make, protoc, and git.\n\n#### Linux/Debian\n\nOn a Debian-like system, you can get these extra dependencies through `apt`:\n\n```shell\n$ apt-get install clang libclang-dev cmake make protobuf-compiler git\n```\n\n#### macOS\n\nOn macOS, we have a best-effort maintained script to set up the Rust toolchain you can run by:\n\n```shell\n$ bin/mac_setup.sh\n```\n\n## Rust\n\n### First Build and Test\n\nThe build currently uses a specific version of the Rust nightly compiler, which\nwill be downloaded automatically by cargo. To build and test the basic protocol\nlibraries:\n\n```shell\n$ cargo build\n...\n$ cargo test\n...\n```\n\n### Additional Rust Tools\n\nThe basic tools above should get you set up for most libsignal Rust development. \n\nEventually, you may find that you need some additional Rust tools like `cbindgen` to modify the bridges to the \nclient libraries or `taplo` for code formatting. \n\nYou should always install any Rust tools you need that may affect the build from cargo rather than from your system\npackage manager (e.g. `apt` or `brew`). Package managers sometimes contain outdated versions of these tools that can break\nthe build with incompatibility issues (especially cbindgen).\n\nTo install the main Rust extra dependencies matching the versions we use, you can run the following commands:\n\n```shell\n$ cargo +stable install --version \"$(cat .cbindgen-version)\" --locked cbindgen\n$ cargo +stable install --version \"$(cat acknowledgments/cargo-about-version)\" --locked cargo-about\n$ cargo +stable install --version \"$(cat .taplo-cli-version)\" --locked taplo-cli\n$ cargo +stable install cargo-fuzz\n```\n\n## Java/Android\n\n### Toolchain Setup / Configuration\n\nTo build for Android you must install several additional packages including a JDK,\nthe Android NDK/SDK, and add the Android targets to the Rust compiler, using\n\n```rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi aarch64-linux-android i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android```\n\nOur officially supported JDK version for Android builds is JDK 17, so be sure to install e.g. OpenJDK 17, and then point JAVA_HOME to it.\n\nYou can easily do this on macOS via:\n\n```shell\nexport JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)\n```\n\nOn Linux, the way you do this varies by distribution. For Debian based distributions like Ubuntu, you can use:\n\n```shell\nsudo update-alternatives --config java\n```\n\nWe also check-in a `.tools_version` file for use with runtime version managers.\n\n### Building and Testing\n\nTo build the Java/Android ``jar`` and ``aar``, and run the tests:\n\n```shell\n$ cd java\n$ ./gradlew test\n$ ./gradlew build # if you need AAR outputs\n```\n\nYou can pass `-P debugLevelLogs` to Gradle to build without filtering out debug- and verbose-level\nlogs from Rust, and `-P jniTypeTagging` to enable additional checks in the Rust JNI bridging code.\n\nAlternately, a build system using Docker is available:\n\n```shell\n$ cd java\n$ make\n```\n\nWhen exposing new APIs to Java, you will need to run `rust/bridge/jni/bin/gen_java_decl.py` in\naddition to rebuilding. This requires installing the `cbindgen` Rust tool, as detailed above. \n\n### Use as a library\n\nSignal publishes Java packages for its own use, under the names org.signal:libsignal-server,\norg.signal:libsignal-client, and org.signal:libsignal-android. libsignal-client and libsignal-server\ncontain native libraries for Debian-flavored x86_64 Linux as well as Windows (x86_64) and macOS\n(x86_64 and arm64). libsignal-android contains native libraries for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and\nx86_64 Android. These are located in a Maven repository at\nhttps://build-artifacts.signal.org/libraries/maven/; for use from Gradle, add the following to your\n`repositories` block:\n\n```\nmaven {\n  name = \"SignalBuildArtifacts\"\n  // The \"uri()\" part is only necessary for Kotlin Gradle; Groovy Gradle accepts a bare string here.\n  url = uri(\"https://build-artifacts.signal.org/libraries/maven/\")\n}\n```\n\nOlder builds were published to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org) instead.\n\nWhen building for Android you need *both* libsignal-android and libsignal-client, but the Windows\nand macOS libraries in libsignal-client won't automatically be excluded from your final app. You can\nexplicitly exclude them using `packagingOptions`:\n\n```\nandroid {\n  // ...\n  packagingOptions {\n    resources {\n      excludes += setOf(\"libsignal_jni*.dylib\", \"signal_jni*.dll\")\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nYou can additionally exclude `libsignal_jni_testing.so` if you do not plan to use any of the APIs\nintended for client testing.\n\n\n## Swift\n\nTo learn about the Swift build process see [``swift/README.md``](swift/)\n\n\n## Node\n\nYou'll need Node installed to build. If you have [nvm][], you can run `nvm use` to select an\nappropriate version automatically.\n\nWe use `npm` as our package manager, and a Python script to control building the Rust library, accessible as `npm run build`.\n\n```shell\n$ cd node\n$ nvm use\n$ npm install\n$ npm run build\n$ npm run tsc\n$ npm run test\n```\n\nWhen testing changes locally, you can use `npm run build` to do an incremental rebuild of the Rust library. Alternately, `npm run build-with-debug-level-logs` will rebuild without filtering out debug- and verbose-level logs.\n\nWhen exposing new APIs to Node, you will need to run `rust/bridge/node/bin/gen_ts_decl.py` in\naddition to rebuilding.\n\n[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\n\n### NPM\n\nSignal publishes the NPM package `@signalapp/libsignal-client` for its own use, including native\nlibraries for Windows, macOS, and Debian-flavored Linux. Both x64 and arm64 builds are included for\nall three platforms, but the arm64 builds for Windows and Linux are considered experimental, since\nthere are no official builds of Signal for those architectures.\n\n\n# Contributions\n\nSignal does accept external contributions to this project. However unless the change is\nsimple and easily understood, for example fixing a bug or portability issue, adding a new\ntest, or improving performance, first open an issue to discuss your intended change as not\nall changes can be accepted.\n\nContributions that will not be used directly by one of Signal's official client apps may still be\nconsidered, but only if they do not pose an undue maintenance burden or conflict with the goals of\nthe project.\n\nSigning a [CLA (Contributor License Agreement)](https://signal.org/cla/) is required for all contributions.\n\n## Code Formatting and Acknowledgments\n\nYou can run the styler on the entire project by running:\n\n```shell\njust format-all\n```\n\nYou can run more extensive tests as well as linters and clippy by running:\n\n```shell\njust check-pre-commit\n```\n\nWhen making a PR that adjusts dependencies, you'll need to regenerate our acknowledgments files.

Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your\nblog to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is distributed under the\n[PHP License v3.01](LICENSE).\n\n[![Push](https://github.com/php/php-src/actions/workflows/push.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/php/php-src/actions/workflows/push.yml)\n[![Fuzzing Status](https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/badges/php.svg)](https://issues.oss-fuzz.com/issues?q=project:php)\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe PHP manual is available at [php.net/docs](https://www.php.net/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prebuilt packages and binaries\n\nPrebuilt packages and binaries can be used to get up and running fast with PHP.\n\nFor Windows, the PHP binaries can be obtained from\n[windows.php.net](https://windows.php.net). After extracting the archive the\n`*.exe` files are ready to use.\n\nFor other systems, see the [installation chapter](https://www.php.net/install).\n\n### Building PHP source code\n\n*For Windows, see [Build your own PHP on Windows](https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild_sdk_2).*\n\nFor a minimal PHP build from Git, you will need autoconf, bison, and re2c. For\na default build, you will additionally need libxml2 and libsqlite3.\n\nOn Ubuntu, you can install these using:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt install -y pkg-config build-essential autoconf bison re2c libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev\n```\n\nOn Fedora, you can install these using:\n\n```shell\nsudo dnf install re2c bison autoconf make libtool ccache libxml2-devel sqlite-devel\n```\n\nOn MacOS, you can install these using `brew`:\n\n```shell\nbrew install autoconf bison re2c libiconv libxml2 sqlite\n```\n\nor with `MacPorts`:\n\n```shell\nsudo port install autoconf bison re2c libiconv libxml2 sqlite3\n```\n\nGenerate configure:\n\n```shell\n./buildconf\n```\n\nConfigure your build. `--enable-debug` is recommended for development, see\n`./configure --help` for a full list of options.\n\n```shell\n# For development\n./configure --enable-debug\n# For production\n./configure\n```\n\nBuild PHP. To speed up the build, specify the maximum number of jobs using the\n`-j` argument:\n\n```shell\nmake -j4\n```\n\nThe number of jobs should usually match the number of available cores, which\ncan be determined using `nproc`.\n\n## Testing PHP source code\n\nPHP ships with an extensive test suite, the command `make test` is used after\nsuccessful compilation of the sources to run this test suite.\n\nIt is possible to run tests using multiple cores by setting `-jN` in\n`TEST_PHP_ARGS` or `TESTS`:\n\n```shell\nmake TEST_PHP_ARGS=-j4 test\n```\n\nShall run `make test` with a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs: Generally the maximum\nnumber of jobs should not exceed the number of cores available.\n\nUse the `TEST_PHP_ARGS` or `TESTS` variable to test only specific directories:\n\n```shell\nmake TESTS=tests/lang/ test\n```\n\nThe [qa.php.net](https://qa.php.net) site provides more detailed info about\ntesting and quality assurance.\n\n## Installing PHP built from source\n\nAfter a successful build (and test), PHP may be installed with:\n\n```shell\nmake install\n```\n\nDepending on your permissions and prefix, `make install` may need superuser\npermissions.\n\n## PHP extensions\n\nExtensions provide additional functionality on top of PHP. PHP consists of many\nessential bundled extensions. Additional extensions can be found in the PHP\nExtension Community Library - [PECL](https://pecl.php.net).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe PHP source code is located in the Git repository at\n[github.com/php/php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src).

Charts has now been renamed DGCharts to prevent conflicts with Apple's new Swift Charts. Please read [the release/migration notes](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/releases/tag/5.0.0).\n\n### One more heads up: As Swift evolves, if you are not using the latest Swift compiler, you shouldn't check out the master branch. Instead, you should go to the release page and pick up whatever suits you.\n\n- Xcode 14 / Swift 5.7 (master branch)\n- iOS >= 12.0 (Use as an **Embedded** Framework)\n- tvOS >= 12.0\n- macOS >= 10.13\n\nOkay so there's this beautiful library called [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) by [Philipp Jahoda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippjahoda) which has become very popular amongst Android developers, but there was no decent solution to create charts for iOS.\n\nI've chosen to write it in `Swift` as it can be highly optimized by the compiler, and can be used in both `Swift` and `ObjC` project. The demo project is written in `ObjC` to demonstrate how it works.\n\n**An amazing feature** of this library now, for Android, iOS, tvOS and macOS, is the time it saves you when developing for both platforms, as the learning curve is singleton- it happens only once, and the code stays very similar so developers don't have to go around and re-invent the app to produce the same output with a different library. (And that's not even considering the fact that there's not really another good choice out there currently...)\n\n## Having trouble running the demo?\n\n- `ChartsDemo/ChartsDemo.xcodeproj` is the demo project for iOS/tvOS\n- `ChartsDemo-OSX/ChartsDemo-OSX.xcodeproj` is the demo project for macOS\n- Make sure you are running a supported version of Xcode.\n  - Usually it is specified here a few lines above.\n  - In most cases it will be the latest Xcode version.\n- Make sure that your project supports Swift 5.0\n- Optional: Run `carthage checkout` in the project folder, to fetch dependencies (i.e testing dependencies).\n  - If you don't have Carthage - you can get it [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases).\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to correctly compile:\n\n1. Drag the `DGCharts.xcodeproj` to your project\n2. Go to your target's settings, hit the \"+\" under the \"Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content\" section, and select the DGCharts.framework\n3. `@import DGCharts`\n4. When using Swift in an ObjC project:\n\n- You need to import your Bridging Header. Usually it is \"_YourProject-Swift.h_\", so in ChartsDemo it's \"_ChartsDemo-Swift.h_\". Do not try to actually include \"_ChartsDemo-Swift.h_\" in your project :-)\n- (Xcode 8.1 and earlier) Under \"Build Options\", mark \"Embedded Content Contains Swift Code\"\n- (Xcode 8.2+) Under \"Build Options\", mark \"Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries\"\n\n5. When using [Realm.io](https://realm.io/):\n   - Note that the Realm framework is not linked with Charts - it is only there for _optional_ bindings. Which means that you need to have the framework in your project, and in a compatible version to whatever is compiled with DGCharts. We will do our best to always compile against the latest version.\n   - You'll need to add `ChartsRealm` as a dependency too.\n\n## 3rd party tutorials\n\n#### Video tutorials\n\n- [Chart in Swift - Setting Up a Basic Line Chart Using iOS Charts(Alex Nagy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWhwe_tLNE8&list=PL_csAAO9PQ8bjzg-wxEff1Fr0Y5W1hrum&index=5)\n- [Charts Framework in SwiftUI - Bar Chart (Stewart Lynch)](https://youtu.be/csd7pyfEXgw)\n\n#### Blog posts\n\n- [Using Realm and Charts with Swift 3 in iOS 10 (Sami Korpela)](https://medium.com/@skoli/using-realm-and-charts-with-swift-3-in-ios-10-40c42e3838c0#.2gyymwfh8)\n- [Creating a Line Chart in Swift 3 and iOS 10 (Osian Smith)](https://medium.com/@OsianSmith/creating-a-line-chart-in-swift-3-and-ios-10-2f647c95392e)\n- [Beginning Set-up and Example Using Charts with Swift 3](https://github.com/annalizhaz/ChartsForSwiftBasic)\n- [Creating a Radar Chart in Swift (David Piper)](https://medium.com/@HeyDaveTheDev/creating-a-radar-chart-in-swift-5791afcf92f0)\n- [Plotting in IOS using Charts framework with SwiftUI (Evgeny Basisty)](https://medium.com/@zzzzbh/plotting-in-ios-using-charts-framework-with-swiftui-222034a2bea6)\n- [Set Up a Basic Bar Chart Using iOS-Charts (Penny Huang)](https://medium.com/@penny-huang/swift-setting-up-a-basic-bar-chart-using-ios-charts-afd6aad96ac)\n- [iOS-Charts Tutorial: Highlight Selected Value With a Custom Marker (Penny Huang)](https://medium.com/@penny-huang/swift-ios-charts-tutorial-highlight-selected-value-with-a-custom-marker-30ccbf92aa1b)\n- [Drawing Charts in iOS Before SwiftUI (Gennady Stepanov)](https://medium.com/better-programming/drawing-charts-in-ios-before-swiftui-9f95b8612607)\n\nWant your tutorial to show here?

Dapr increases your developer productivity by 20-40% with out-of-the-box features such as workflow, pub/sub, state management, secret stores, external configuration, bindings, actors, distributed lock, and cryptography. You benefit from the built-in security, reliability, and observability capabilities, so you don't need to write boilerplate code to achieve production-ready applications.\n\nWith Dapr, a graduated CNCF project, platform teams can configure complex setups while exposing simple interfaces to application development teams, making it easier for them to build highly scalable distributed applications. Many platform teams have adopted Dapr to provide governance and golden paths for API-based infrastructure interaction.\n\n![Dapr overview](./img/overview.png)\n\nWe are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project.\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kedacore/keda/main/images/logo-cncf.svg\" height=\"75px\"></p>\n\n## Goals\n\n- Enable developers using *any* language or framework to write distributed applications\n- Solve the hard problems developers face building microservice applications by providing best practice building blocks\n- Be community driven, open and vendor neutral\n- Gain new contributors\n- Provide consistency and portability through open APIs\n- Be platform agnostic across cloud and edge\n- Embrace extensibility and provide pluggable components without vendor lock-in\n- Enable IoT and edge scenarios by being highly performant and lightweight\n- Be incrementally adoptable from existing code, with no runtime dependency\n\n## How it works\n\nDapr injects a side-car (container or process) to each compute unit. The side-car interacts with event triggers and communicates with the compute unit via standard HTTP or gRPC protocols. This enables Dapr to support all existing and future programming languages without requiring you to import frameworks or libraries.\n\nDapr offers built-in state management, reliable messaging (at least once delivery), triggers and bindings through standard HTTP verbs or gRPC interfaces. This allows you to write stateless, stateful and actor-like services following the same programming paradigm. You can freely choose consistency model, threading model and message delivery patterns.\n\nDapr runs natively on Kubernetes, as a self hosted binary on your machine, on an IoT device, or as a container that can be injected into any system, in the cloud or on-premises.\n\nDapr uses pluggable component state stores and message buses such as Redis as well as gRPC to offer a wide range of communication methods, including direct dapr-to-dapr using gRPC and async Pub-Sub with guaranteed delivery and at-least-once semantics.\n\n\n## Why Dapr?\n\nWriting highly performant, scalable and reliable distributed application is hard. Dapr brings proven patterns and practices to you. It unifies event-driven and actors semantics into a simple, consistent programming model. It supports all programming languages without framework lock-in. You are not exposed to low-level primitives such as threading, concurrency control, partitioning and scaling. Instead, you can write your code by implementing a simple web server using familiar web frameworks of your choice.\n\nDapr is flexible in threading and state consistency models. You can leverage multi-threading if you choose to, and you can choose among different consistency models. This flexibility enables you to implement advanced scenarios without artificial constraints. Dapr is unique because you can transition seamlessly between platforms and underlying implementations without rewriting your code.\n\n## Features\n\n* Event-driven Pub-Sub system with pluggable providers and at-least-once semantics\n* Input and output bindings with pluggable providers\n* State management with pluggable data stores\n* Consistent service-to-service discovery and invocation\n* Opt-in stateful models: Strong/Eventual consistency, First-write/Last-write wins\n* Cross platform virtual actors\n* Secret management to retrieve secrets from secure key vaults\n* Rate limiting\n* Built-in [Observability](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/observability-concept/) support\n* Runs natively on Kubernetes using a dedicated Operator and CRDs\n* Supports all programming languages via HTTP and gRPC\n* Multi-Cloud, open components (bindings, pub-sub, state) from Azure, AWS, GCP\n* Runs anywhere, as a process or containerized\n* Lightweight (58MB binary, 4MB physical memory)\n* Runs as a sidecar - removes the need for special SDKs or libraries\n* Dedicated CLI - developer friendly experience with easy debugging\n* Clients for Java, .NET Core, Go, Javascript, Python, Rust and C++\n\n## Get Started using Dapr\n\nSee our [Getting Started](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/) guide over in our docs.\n\n## Quickstarts and Samples\n\n* See the [quickstarts repository](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts) for code examples that can help you get started with Dapr.\n* Explore additional samples in the Dapr [samples repository](https://github.com/dapr/samples).\n\n## Community\nWe want your contributions and suggestions!

Java, C, and C++ clients are available in this\nrepository, and a [.NET client](https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/Aeron.NET) is available. All\nclients can exchange messages across machines, or on the same machine via IPC, very efficiently. Message streams can be\nrecorded by the [Archive](https://github.com/aeron-io/aeron/tree/master/aeron-archive) module to persistent storage\nfor later, or real-time, replay. Aeron [Cluster](https://github.com/aeron-io/aeron/tree/master/aeron-cluster)\nprovides support for fault-tolerant services as replicated state machines based on the\n[Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus algorithm.\n\nPerformance is the key focus. A design goal for Aeron is to be the highest throughput with the lowest and most\npredictable latency of any messaging system. Aeron integrates with\n[Simple Binary Encoding (SBE)](https://github.com/aeron-io/simple-binary-encoding) for the best possible message\nencoding and decoding performance. Many of the data structures used in the creation of Aeron have been factored out to\nthe [Agrona](https://github.com/aeron-io/agrona) project.\n\nFor details of usage, protocol specification, FAQ, etc. please check out the\n[Wiki](https://github.com/aeron-io/aeron/wiki).\n\nFor the latest version information and changes see the [Change Log](https://github.com/aeron-io/aeron/wiki/Change-Log)\nwith Java **downloads** at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Caeron).\n\nAeron is owned and operated by Adaptive Financial Consulting. Originally created by Martin Thompson and Todd Montgomery, the Aeron team joined Adaptive in 2022.\n\nFor Business users, to get started with Aeron Premium, please visit [Aeron.io](https://aeron.io)\n\nWe provide a range of services including:\n* Training for development and operations with Aeron and Aeron Cluster.\n* Consulting, for example if you’re not sure how to design your system or need help tuning your system.\n* We also offer a number of proprietary enhancements on top of Aeron and Aeron Cluster such as kernel bypass (ef_vi, AWS DPDK, and VMA) for increased performance, and blazing fast encryption with ATS.\n* If you’re building a new trading system, we have experienced Aeron developers who can help.\n\nPlease get in touch at [sales@aeron.io](mailto:sales@aeron.io?subject=Aeron) if you would like to learn more about any of these.\n\n### How do I use Aeron?\n\n1.

We release new major versions (with potentially\nbreaking API changes) at most once a quarter, and release incremental minor\nversions in the intervening months. See [ticket #5368] for more details.\n\nTo keep our maintenance burden down, we do regularly scheduled releases (major\nand minor) from the `main` branch. How we handle PRs with breaking API changes\nis described in the [contributing] guide.\n\n[contributing]: CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-changes\n\nPlanned Release Schedule\n\n| Approximate Date | Version    | Notes                                   |\n| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| October 2025     | [`57.0.0`] | Major, potentially breaking API changes |\n| November 2025    | [`57.1.0`] | Minor, NO breaking API changes          |\n| December 2025    | [`57.2.0`] | Minor, NO breaking API changes          |\n| January 2026     | [`58.0.0`] | Major, potentially breaking API changes |\n\n[`57.0.0`]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/7835\n[`57.1.0`]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/milestone/3\n[`57.2.0`]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/milestone/5\n[`58.0.0`]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/milestone/6\n[ticket #5368]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/5368\n[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org/\n\n### Rust Version Compatibility Policy\n\narrow-rs and parquet are built and tested with stable Rust, and will keep a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) that can only be updated in major releases on a need by basis (e.g. project dependencies bump their MSRV or a particular Rust feature is useful for us etc.). The new MSRV if selected will be at least 6 months old. The minor releases are guaranteed to have the same MSRV.\n\nNote: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.\n\n### Guidelines for `panic` vs `Result`\n\nIn general, use panics for bad states that are unreachable, unrecoverable or harmful.\nFor those caused by invalid user input, however, we prefer to report that invalidity\ngracefully as an error result instead of panicking. In general, invalid input should result\nin an `Error` as soon as possible. It _is_ ok for code paths after validation to assume\nvalidation has already occurred and panic if not. See [ticket #6737] for more nuances.\n\n[ticket #6737]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/6737\n\n### Deprecation Guidelines\n\nMinor releases may deprecate, but not remove APIs. Deprecating APIs allows\ndownstream Rust programs to still compile, but generate compiler warnings. This\ngives downstream crates time to migrate prior to API removal.\n\nTo deprecate an API:\n\n- Mark the API as deprecated using `#[deprecated]` and specify the exact arrow-rs version in which it was deprecated\n- Concisely describe the preferred API to help the user transition\n\nThe deprecated version is the next version which will be released (please\nconsult the list above). To mark the API as deprecated, use the\n`#[deprecated(since = \"...\", note = \"...\")]` attribute.\n\nFor example\n\n```rust\n#[deprecated(since = \"51.0.0\", note = \"Use `date_part` instead\")]\n```\n\nIn general, deprecated APIs will remain in the codebase for at least two major releases after\nthey were deprecated (typically between 6 - 9 months later). For example, an API\ndeprecated in `51.3.0` can be removed in `54.0.0` (or later). Deprecated APIs\nmay be removed earlier or later than these guidelines at the discretion of the\nmaintainers.\n\n## Related Projects\n\nThere are several related crates in different repositories\n\n| Crate               | Description                                                  | Documentation                      |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |\n| [`object_store`]    | Object Storage (aws, azure, gcp, local, in-memory) interface | [(README)](object_store-readme)    |\n| [`datafusion`]      | In-memory query engine with SQL support                      | [(README)][datafusion-readme]      |\n| [`ballista`]        | Distributed query execution                                  | [(README)][ballista-readme]        |\n| [`parquet_opendal`] | Use [`opendal`] for [`parquet`] Arrow IO                     | [(README)][parquet_opendal-readme] |\n\n[`datafusion`]: https://crates.io/crates/datafusion\n[`ballista`]: https://crates.io/crates/ballista\n[`parquet_opendal`]: https://crates.io/crates/parquet_opendal\n[parquet_opendal-readme]: https://github.com/apache/opendal/blob/main/integrations/parquet/README.md\n[object_store-readme]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs-object-store/blob/main/README.md\n\nCollectively, these crates support a wider array of functionality for analytic computations in Rust.\n\nFor example, you can write SQL queries or a `DataFrame` (using the\n[`datafusion`] crate) to read a parquet file (using the [`parquet`] crate),\nevaluate it in-memory using Arrow's columnar format (using the [`arrow`] crate),\nand send to another process (using the [`arrow-flight`] crate).\n\nGenerally speaking, the [`arrow`] crate offers functionality for using Arrow\narrays, and [`datafusion`] offers most operations typically found in SQL,\nincluding `join`s and window functions.\n\nYou can find more details about each crate in their respective READMEs.\n\n## Arrow Rust Community\n\nThe `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list serves as the core communication channel for the Arrow community. Instructions for signing up and links to the archives can be found on the [Arrow Community](https://arrow.apache.org/community/) page. All major announcements and communications happen there.\n\nThe Rust Arrow community also uses the official [ASF Slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) for informal discussions and coordination. This is\na great place to meet other contributors and get guidance on where to contribute. Join us in the `#arrow-rust` channel and feel free to ask for an invite via:\n\n1. the `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list\n2. the [GitHub Discussions][discussions]\n3. the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YAb2TdazKQ)\n\nThe Rust implementation uses [GitHub issues][issues] as the system of record for new features and bug fixes and\nthis plays a critical role in the release process.\n\nFor design discussions we generally use GitHub issues.\n\nThere is more information in the [contributing] guide.\n\n[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/\n[`object_store`]: https://crates.io/crates/object-store\n[arrow-readme]: arrow/README.md\n[contributing]: CONTRIBUTING.md\n[parquet-readme]: parquet/README.md\n[flight-readme]: arrow-flight/README.md\n[datafusion-readme]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/README.md\n[ballista-readme]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ballista/blob/main/README.md\n[parquet-derive-readme]: parquet_derive/README.md\n[issues]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues\n[discussions]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/discussions\n",

Thrust's high-level interface greatly enhances programmer productivity while enabling performance portability between GPUs and multicore CPUs via configurable backends that allow using multiple parallel programming frameworks (such as CUDA, TBB, and OpenMP).\n\n- **CUB** is a lower-level, CUDA-specific library designed for speed-of-light parallel algorithms across all GPU architectures. In addition to device-wide algorithms, it provides *cooperative algorithms* like block-wide reduction and warp-wide scan, providing CUDA kernel developers with building blocks to create speed-of-light, custom kernels.\n\n- **libcudacxx** is the CUDA C++ Standard Library. It provides an implementation of the C++ Standard Library that works in both host and device code. Additionally, it provides abstractions for CUDA-specific hardware features like synchronization primitives, cache control, atomics, and more.\n\nThe main goal of CCCL is to fill a similar role that the Standard C++ Library fills for Standard C++: provide general-purpose, speed-of-light tools to CUDA C++ developers, allowing them to focus on solving the problems that matter.\nUnifying these projects is the first step towards realizing that goal.\n\n## Example\n\nThis is a simple example demonstrating the use of CCCL functionality from Thrust, CUB, and libcudacxx.\n\nIt shows how to use Thrust/CUB/libcudacxx to implement a simple parallel reduction kernel.\nEach thread block computes the sum of a subset of the array using `cub::BlockReduce`.\nThe sum of each block is then reduced to a single value using an atomic add via `cuda::atomic_ref` from libcudacxx.\n\nIt then shows how the same reduction can be done using Thrust's `reduce` algorithm and compares the results.\n\n[Try it live on Godbolt!](https://godbolt.org/z/3KaWz3Msf)\n\n```cpp\n#include <thrust/execution_policy.h>\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n#include <cub/block/block_reduce.cuh>\n#include <cuda/atomic>\n#include <cuda/cmath>\n#include <cuda/std/span>\n#include <cstdio>\n\ntemplate <int block_size>\n__global__ void reduce(cuda::std::span<int const> data, cuda::std::span<int> result) {\n  using BlockReduce = cub::BlockReduce<int, block_size>;\n  __shared__ typename BlockReduce::TempStorage temp_storage;\n\n  int const index = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;\n  int sum = 0;\n  if (index < data.size()) {\n    sum += data[index];\n  }\n  sum = BlockReduce(temp_storage).Sum(sum);\n\n  if (threadIdx.x == 0) {\n    cuda::atomic_ref<int, cuda::thread_scope_device> atomic_result(result.front());\n    atomic_result.fetch_add(sum, cuda::memory_order_relaxed);\n  }\n}\n\nint main() {\n\n  // Allocate and initialize input data\n  int const N = 1000;\n  thrust::device_vector<int> data(N);\n  thrust::fill(data.begin(), data.end(), 1);\n\n  // Allocate output data\n  thrust::device_vector<int> kernel_result(1);\n\n  // Compute the sum reduction of `data` using a custom kernel\n  constexpr int block_size = 256;\n  int const num_blocks = cuda::ceil_div(N, block_size);\n  reduce<block_size><<<num_blocks, block_size>>>(cuda::std::span<int const>(thrust::raw_pointer_cast(data.data()), data.size()),\n                                                 cuda::std::span<int>(thrust::raw_pointer_cast(kernel_result.data()), 1));\n\n  auto const err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n  if (err != cudaSuccess) {\n    std::cout << \"Error: \" << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;\n    return -1;\n  }\n\n  int const custom_result = kernel_result[0];\n\n  // Compute the same sum reduction using Thrust\n  int const thrust_result = thrust::reduce(thrust::device, data.begin(), data.end(), 0);\n\n  // Ensure the two solutions are identical\n  std::printf(\"Custom kernel sum: %d\\n\", custom_result);\n  std::printf(\"Thrust reduce sum: %d\\n\", thrust_result);\n  assert(kernel_result[0] == thrust_result);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Users\n\nEverything in CCCL is header-only.\nTherefore, users need only concern themselves with how they get the header files and how they incorporate them into their build system.\n\n#### CUDA Toolkit\nThe easiest way to get started using CCCL is via the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) which includes the CCCL headers.\nWhen you compile with `nvcc`, it automatically adds CCCL headers to your include path so you can simply `#include` any CCCL header in your code with no additional configuration required.\n\nIf compiling with another compiler, you will need to update your build system's include search path to point to the CCCL headers in your CTK install (e.g., `/usr/local/cuda/include`).\n\n```cpp\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n#include <cub/cub.cuh>\n#include <cuda/std/atomic>\n```\n\n#### GitHub\n\nUsers who want to stay on the cutting edge of CCCL development are encouraged to use CCCL from GitHub.\nUsing a newer version of CCCL with an older version of the CUDA Toolkit is supported, but not the other way around.\nFor complete information on compatibility between CCCL and the CUDA Toolkit, see [our platform support](#platform-support).\n\nEverything in CCCL is header-only, so cloning and including it in a simple project is as easy as the following:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl.git\nnvcc -Icccl/thrust -Icccl/libcudacxx/include -Icccl/cub main.cu -o main\n```\n> **Note**\n> Use `-I` and not `-isystem` to avoid collisions with the CCCL headers implicitly included by `nvcc` from the CUDA Toolkit. All CCCL headers use `#pragma system_header` to ensure warnings will still be silenced as if using `-isystem`, see https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl/issues/527 for more information.\n\n##### Installation\n\nThe default CMake options generate only installation rules, so the familiar\n`cmake . && make install` workflow just works:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl.git\ncd cccl\ncmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local\nmake install\n```\n\nA convenience script is also provided:\n\n```bash\nci/install_cccl.sh /usr/local\n```\n\n###### Advanced installation using presets\n\nCMake presets are also available with options for including experimental\nlibraries:\n\n```bash\ncmake --preset install -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local\ncmake --build --preset install --target install\n```\n\nUse the `install-unstable` preset to include experimental libraries, or\n`install-unstable-only` to install only experimental libraries.\n\n#### Conda\n\nCCCL also provides conda packages of each release via the `conda-forge` channel:\n\n```bash\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nconda install cccl\n```\n\nThis will install the latest CCCL to the conda environment's `$CONDA_PREFIX/include/` and `$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/cmake/` directories.\nIt is discoverable by CMake via `find_package(CCCL)` and can be used by any compilers in the conda environment.\nFor more information, see [this introduction to conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction/).\n\nIf you want to use the same CCCL version that shipped with a particular CUDA Toolkit, e.g. CUDA 12.4, you can install CCCL with:\n\n```bash\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nconda install cuda-cccl cuda-version=12.4\n```\n\nThe `cuda-cccl` metapackage installs the `cccl` version that shipped with the CUDA Toolkit corresponding to `cuda-version`.\nIf you wish to update to the latest `cccl` after installing `cuda-cccl`, uninstall `cuda-cccl` before updating `cccl`:\n\n```bash\nconda uninstall cuda-cccl\nconda install -c conda-forge cccl\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> There are also conda packages with names like `cuda-cccl_linux-64`.\n> Those packages contain the CCCL versions shipped as part of the CUDA Toolkit, but are designed for internal use by the CUDA Toolkit.\n> Install `cccl` or `cuda-cccl` instead, for compatibility with conda compilers.\n> For more information, see the [cccl conda-forge recipe](https://github.com/conda-forge/cccl-feedstock/blob/main/recipe/meta.yaml).\n\n##### CMake Integration\n\nCCCL uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for all build and installation infrastructure, including tests as well as targets to link against in other CMake projects.\nTherefore, CMake is the recommended way to integrate CCCL into another project.\n\nFor a complete example of how to do this using CMake Package Manager see [our basic example project](examples/basic).\n\nOther build systems should work, but only CMake is tested.\nContributions to simplify integrating CCCL into other build systems are welcome.\n\n### Contributors\n\nInterested in contributing to making CCCL better? Check out our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a comprehensive overview of everything you need to know to set up your development environment, make changes, run tests, and submit a PR.\n\n## Platform Support\n\n**Objective:** This section describes where users can expect CCCL to compile and run successfully.\n\nIn general, CCCL should work everywhere the CUDA Toolkit is supported, however, the devil is in the details.\nThe sections below describe the details of support and testing for different versions of the CUDA Toolkit, host compilers, and C++ dialects.\n\n### CUDA Toolkit (CTK) Compatibility\n\n**Summary:**\n- The latest version of CCCL is backward compatible with the current and preceding CTK major version series\n- CCCL is never forward compatible with any version of the CTK. Always use the same or newer than what is included with your CTK.\n- Minor version CCCL upgrades won't break existing code, but new features may not support all CTK versions\n\nCCCL users are encouraged to capitalize on the latest enhancements and [\"live at head\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tISy7EJQPzI) by always using the newest version of CCCL.\nFor a seamless experience, you can upgrade CCCL independently of the entire CUDA Toolkit.\nThis is possible because CCCL maintains backward compatibility with the latest patch release of every minor CTK release from both the current and previous major version series.\nIn some exceptional cases, the minimum supported minor version of the CUDA Toolkit release may need to be newer than the oldest release within its major version series.\n\nWhen a new major CTK is released, we drop support for the oldest supported major version.\n\n| CCCL Version | Supports CUDA Toolkit Version                  |\n|--------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| 2.x          | 11.1 - 11.8, 12.x (only latest patch releases) |\n| 3.x          | 12.x, 13.x  (only latest patch releases)       |\n\n[Well-behaved code](#compatibility-guidelines) using the latest CCCL should compile and run successfully with any supported CTK version.\nExceptions may occur for new features that depend on new CTK features, so those features would not work on older versions of the CTK.\n\nUsers can integrate a newer version of CCCL into an older CTK, but not the other way around.\nThis means an older version of CCCL is not compatible with a newer CTK.\nIn other words, **CCCL is never forward compatible with the CUDA Toolkit.**\n\nThe table below summarizes compatibility of the CTK and CCCL:\n\n| CTK Version | Included CCCL Version |    Desired CCCL     | Supported? |                           Notes                           |\n|:-----------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:----------:|:--------------------------------------------------------:|\n|  CTK `X.Y`  |  CCCL `MAJOR.MINOR`   | CCCL `MAJOR.MINOR+n` |    ✅     |            Some new features might not work              |\n|  CTK `X.Y`  |  CCCL `MAJOR.MINOR`   | CCCL `MAJOR+1.MINOR` |    ✅     | Possible breaks; some new features might not be available|\n|  CTK `X.Y`  |  CCCL `MAJOR.MINOR`   | CCCL `MAJOR+2.MINOR` |    ❌     |    CCCL supports only two CTK major versions             |\n|  CTK `X.Y`  |  CCCL `MAJOR.MINOR`   | CCCL `MAJOR.MINOR-n` |    ❌     |          CCCL isn't forward compatible                   |\n|  CTK `X.Y`  |  CCCL `MAJOR.MINOR`   | CCCL `MAJOR-n.MINOR` |    ❌     |          CCCL isn't forward compatible                   |\n\nFor more information on CCCL versioning, API/ABI compatibility, and breaking changes see the [Versioning](#versioning) section below.\n\n### Operating Systems\n\nUnless otherwise specified, CCCL supports all the same operating systems as the CUDA Toolkit, which are documented here:\n - [Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#system-requirements)\n - [Windows](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html#system-requirements)\n\n### Host Compilers\n\nUnless otherwise specified, CCCL supports the same host compilers as the latest CUDA Toolkit, which are documented here:\n- [Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#host-compiler-support-policy)\n- [Windows](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html#system-requirements)\n\nFor GCC on Linux, at least 7.x is required.\n\nWhen using older CUDA Toolkits, we also only support the host compilers of the latest CUDA Toolkit,\nbut at least the most recent host compiler of any supported older CUDA Toolkit.\n\nWe may retain support of additional compilers and will accept corresponding patches from the community with reasonable fixes.\nBut we will not invest significant time in triaging or fixing issues for older compilers.\n\nIn the spirit of \"You only support what you test\", see our [CI Overview](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl/blob/main/ci-overview.md) for more information on exactly what we test.\n\n### GPU Architectures\n\nCCCL supports all GPU architectures that are [supported by the *current* major CUDA Toolkit (CTK)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).\n\nTo be clear, while CCCL can be compiled with both the current and previous CTK major versions, we do not test or validate architectures that were only supported in the older CTK.\n\nThose architectures may still work — we do not intentionally break them — but they are outside our regular CI coverage. Furthermore, new features are not guaranteed to work with these architectures either.\n\nWe welcome community contributions for reasonable fixes that unblock users on these older architectures.\n\nFor example, CCCL 3.0 supports compiling with CTK 12.x and 13.x where\n- CUDA Toolkit 13.x supports `>=sm_75`\n- CUDA Toolkit 12.x supports `>=sm_50`\n\nIn this scenario, compiling CCCL 3.0 with CTK 12.x targeting architectures below `sm_75` may work, but those configurations are not part of our regular testing.\n\n### C++ Dialects\n- C++17\n- C++20\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\nCCCL's testing strategy strikes a balance between testing as many configurations as possible and maintaining reasonable CI times.\n\nFor CUDA Toolkit versions, testing is done against both the oldest and the newest supported versions.\nFor instance, if the latest version of the CUDA Toolkit is 12.6, tests are conducted against 11.1 and 12.6.\nFor each CUDA version, builds are completed against all supported host compilers with all supported C++ dialects.\n\nThe testing strategy and matrix are constantly evolving.\nThe matrix defined in the [`ci/matrix.yaml`](ci/matrix.yaml) file is the definitive source of truth.\nFor more information about our CI pipeline, see [here](ci-overview.md).\n\n## Versioning\n\n**Objective:** This section describes how CCCL is versioned, API/ABI stability guarantees, and compatibility guidelines to minimize upgrade headaches.\n\n**Summary**\n- The entirety of CCCL's API shares a common semantic version across all components\n- Only the most recently released version is supported and fixes are not backported to prior releases\n- API breaking changes and incrementing CCCL's major version will only coincide with a new major version release of the CUDA Toolkit\n- Not all source breaking changes are considered breaking changes of the public API that warrant bumping the major version number\n- Do not rely on ABI stability of entities in the `cub::` or `thrust::` namespaces\n- ABI breaking changes for symbols in the `cuda::` namespace may happen at any time, but will be reflected by incrementing the ABI version which is embedded in an inline namespace for all `cuda::` symbols. Multiple ABI versions may be supported concurrently.\n\n**Note:** Prior to merging Thrust, CUB, and libcudacxx into this repository, each library was independently versioned according to semantic versioning.\nStarting with the 2.1 release, all three libraries synchronized their release versions in their separate repositories.\nMoving forward, CCCL will continue to be released under a single [semantic version](https://semver.org/), with 2.2.0 being the first release from the [nvidia/cccl](www.github.com/nvidia/cccl) repository.\n\n### Breaking Change\n\nA Breaking Change is a change to **explicitly supported** functionality between released versions that would require a user to do work in order to upgrade to the newer version.\n\nIn the limit, [_any_ change](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/) has the potential to break someone somewhere.\nAs a result, not all possible source breaking changes are considered Breaking Changes to the public API that warrant bumping the major semantic version.\n\nThe sections below describe the details of breaking changes to CCCL's API and ABI.\n\n### Application Programming Interface (API)\n\nCCCL's public API is the entirety of the functionality _intentionally_ exposed to provide the utility of the library.\n\nIn other words, CCCL's public API goes beyond just function signatures and includes (but is not limited to):\n- The location and names of headers intended for direct inclusion in user code\n- The namespaces intended for direct use in user code\n- The declarations and/or definitions of functions, classes, and variables located in headers and intended for direct use in user code\n- The semantics of functions, classes, and variables intended for direct use in user code\n\nMoreover, CCCL's public API does **not** include any of the following:\n- Any symbol prefixed with `_` or `__`\n- Any symbol whose name contains `detail` including the `detail::` namespace or a macro\n- Any header file contained in a `detail/` directory or sub-directory thereof\n- The header files implicitly included by any header part of the public API\n\nIn general, the goal is to avoid breaking anything in the public API.\nSuch changes are made only if they offer users better performance, easier-to-understand APIs, and/or more consistent APIs.\n\nAny breaking change to the public API will require bumping CCCL's major version number.\nIn keeping with [CUDA Minor Version Compatibility](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/#minor-version-compatibility),\nAPI breaking changes and CCCL major version bumps will only occur coinciding with a new major version release of the CUDA Toolkit.\n\nAnything not part of the public API may change at any time without warning.\n\n#### API Versioning\n\nThe public API of all CCCL's components share a unified semantic version of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.\n\nOnly the most recently released version is supported.\nAs a rule, features and bug fixes are not backported to previously released version or branches.\n\nThe preferred method for querying the version is to use `CCCL_[MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH_]VERSION` as described below.\nFor backwards compatibility, the Thrust/CUB/libcudacxxx version definitions are available and will always be consistent with `CCCL_VERSION`.\nNote that Thrust/CUB use a `MMMmmmpp` scheme whereas the CCCL and libcudacxx use `MMMmmmppp`.\n\n|                        | CCCL                                   | libcudacxx                                | Thrust                       | CUB

rules for:\n- How a library's components are represented in machine code\n- How those components interact across different translation units\n\nA library's ABI includes, but is not limited to:\n- The mangled names of functions and types\n- The size and alignment of objects and types\n- The semantics of the bytes in the binary representation of an object\n\nAn **ABI Breaking Change** is any change that results in a change to the ABI of a function or type in the public API.\nFor example, adding a new data member to a struct is an ABI Breaking Change as it changes the size of the type.\n\nIn CCCL, the guarantees about ABI are as follows:\n\n- Symbols in the `thrust::` and `cub::` namespaces may break ABI at any time without warning.\n- The ABI of `thrust::` and `cub::` [symbols includes the CUDA architectures used for compilation](https://nvidia.github.io/cccl/cub/developer_overview.html#symbols-visibility). Therefore, a `thrust::` or `cub::` symbol may have a different ABI if:\n    - compiled with different architectures\n    - compiled as a CUDA source file (`-x cu`) vs C++ source (`-x cpp`)\n- Symbols in the `cuda::` namespace may also break ABI at any time. However, `cuda::` symbols embed an ABI version number that is incremented whenever an ABI break occurs. Multiple ABI versions may be supported concurrently, and therefore users have the option to revert to a prior ABI version. For more information, see [here](libcudacxx/docs/releases/versioning.md).\n\n**Who should care about ABI?**\n\nIn general, CCCL users only need to worry about ABI issues when building or using a binary artifact (like a shared library) whose API directly or indirectly includes types provided by CCCL.\n\nFor example, consider if `libA.so` was built using CCCL version `X` and its public API includes a function like:\n```c++\nvoid foo(cuda::std::optional<int>);\n```\n\nIf another library, `libB.so`, is compiled using CCCL version `Y` and uses `foo` from `libA.so`, then this can fail if there was an ABI break between version `X` and `Y`.\nUnlike with API breaking changes, ABI breaks usually do not require code changes and only require recompiling everything to use the same ABI version.\n\nTo learn more about ABI and why it is important, see [What is ABI, and What Should C++ Do About It?](https://wg21.link/P2028R0).\n\n### Compatibility Guidelines\n\nAs mentioned above, not all possible source breaking changes constitute a Breaking Change that would require incrementing CCCL's API major version number.\n\nUsers are encouraged to adhere to the following guidelines in order to minimize the risk of disruptions from accidentally depending on parts of CCCL that are not part of the public API:\n\n- Do not add any declarations to, or specialize any template from, the `thrust::`, `cub::`, `nv::`, or `cuda::` namespaces unless an exception is noted for a specific symbol, e.g., specializing `cuda::std::iterator_traits`\n    - **Rationale**: This would cause conflicts if a symbol or specialization is added with the same name.\n- Do not take the address of any API in the `thrust::`, `cub::`, `cuda::`, or `nv::` namespaces.\n    - **Rationale**: This would prevent adding overloads of these APIs.\n- Do not forward declare any API in the `thrust::`, `cub::`, `cuda::`, or `nv::` namespaces.\n    - **Rationale**: This would prevent adding overloads of these APIs.\n- Do not directly reference any symbol prefixed with `_`, `__`, or with `detail` anywhere in its name including a `detail::` namespace or macro\n     - **Rationale**: These symbols are for internal use only and may change at any time without warning.\n- Include what you use. For every CCCL symbol that you use, directly `#include` the header file that declares that symbol. In other words, do not rely on headers implicitly included by other headers.\n     - **Rationale**: Internal includes may change at any time.\n\nPortions of this section were inspired by [Abseil's Compatibility Guidelines](https://abseil.io/about/compatibility).\n\n## Deprecation Policy\n\nWe will do our best to notify users prior to making any breaking changes to the public API, ABI, or modifying the supported platforms and compilers.\n\nAs appropriate, deprecations will come in the form of programmatic warnings which can be disabled.\n\nThe deprecation period will depend on the impact of the change, but will usually last at least 2 minor version releases.\n\n\n## Mapping to CTK Versions\n\n| CCCL version | CTK version |\n|--------------|-------------|\n| 3.1          | 13.1        |\n| 3.0          | 13.0        |\n| 2.8          | 12.9        |\n| 2.7          | 12.8        |\n| 2.5          | 12.6        |\n| 2.4          | 12.5        |\n| 2.3          | 12.4        |\n\nTest yourself: https://cuda.godbolt.org/z/K818M4Y9f\n\nCTKs before 12.4 shipped Thrust, CUB and libcudacxx as individual libraries.\n\n| Thrust/CUB/libcudacxx version | CTK version |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|\n| 2.2                           | 12.3        |\n| 2.1                           | 12.2        |\n| 2.0/2.0/1.9                   | 12.1        |\n| 2.0/2.0/1.9                   | 12.0        |\n\n\n## CI Pipeline Overview\n\nFor a detailed overview of the CI pipeline, see [ci-overview.md](ci-overview.md).\n\n## Related Projects\n\nProjects that are related to CCCL's mission to make CUDA more delightful:\n- [cuCollections](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuCollections) - GPU accelerated data structures like hash tables\n- [NVBench](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvbench) - Benchmarking library tailored for CUDA applications\n- [stdexec](https://github.com/nvidia/stdexec) - Reference implementation for Senders asynchronous programming model\n\n## Projects Using CCCL\n\nDoes your project use CCCL?

Make sure you download git submodules by running `git submodule update --init --recursive` before trying to build Gramophone.\n\n### Set up package type\nGramophone has a package type that indicates the source of the application package. Package type string is extracted from an external file named `package.properties`.\n\nSimply open your favorite text editor, type `releaseType=SelfBuilt`, and save it in the root folder of the repository as `package.properties`.\n\nAfter this, launch Android Studio and import your own signature. You should be able to build Gramophone now.\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 - see the [LICENSE](https://github.com/FoedusProgramme/Gramophone/blob/beta/LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## Translation\n<a href=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/gramophone/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/gramophone/strings-xml/horizontal-auto.svg\" alt=\"Translation status\" />\n</a>\n\n## Notice\n- For bug reporting: [Telegram](https://t.me/FoedusDiscussion)\n- GitHub/F-Droid/IzzyOnDroid certificate SHA-256 digest: f451197ad7b80bd1bc981ba38a2c49d471856fb38bcc333676d6e8f8f3ce5d6e\n- Play Store certificate SHA-256 digest: 178869b0f9130d145b53404df4d4e5e311095406cb3c51a3e7a4b03bb3e87786\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Why can't I see songs shorter than 60 seconds?**\nGramophone hides songs shorter than 60 seconds by default. You can change it in _Three dots > Settings > Behaviour_ (set the setting to 0 to show all songs).\n\n**I changed the min length setting, but some songs are still missing!**\nMake sure you haven't excluded the folder in _Behaviour > Folder blacklist_.\nThen, try to reboot your phone, then wait a few minutes (this will rescan the system-wide media database Gramophone uses to find songs).\nIf it's still not visible, your system version may not support scanning this file extension: this most commonly is observed for .opus, which will only be scanned since Android 10 (pro tip: rename your .opus file to .ogg, and it will be detected on Android 6 and later).\n\n**My song isn't playing! / My song is playing, but it's completely silent, yet the volume is turned up!**\nPlease note that Gramophone relys on system media codecs to make the app smaller. This means\n- int32 (32-bit) FLAC files will only work on Android 14 or later\n- FLAC files often do work even on versions prior to Android 8, but are only officially supported on Android 8 or later\n- xHE-AAC files in general will only work on Android 9 or later\n- Dolby Digital (AC-3) / Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) / AC-4 requires a device that has licensed decoders for these formats\n\nThere is one exception: ALAC has an extremely lightweight Java decoder available which is included in Gramophone, hence, ALAC files can be played back even without system ALAC decoder.\n\n## Friends\n[SongSync](https://github.com/lambada10/songsync)\n",

      "readme": "# Introduction\n## Unitree mujoco\n`unitree_mujoco` is a simulator developed based on `Unitree sdk2` and `mujoco`. Users can easily integrate the control programs developed with `Unitree_sdk2`, `unitree_ros2`, and `unitree_sdk2_python` into this simulator, enabling a seamless transition from simulation to physical development. The repository includes two versions of the simulator implemented in C++ and Python, with a structure as follows:\n![](./doc/func.png)\n\n## Directory Structure\n- `simulate`: Simulator implemented based on unitree_sdk2 and mujoco (C++, recommended)\n- `simulate_python`: Simulator implemented based on unitree_sdk2_python and mujoco (Python)\n- `unitree_robots`: MJCF description files for robots supported by unitree_sdk2\n- `terrain_tool`: Tool for generating terrain in simulation scenarios\n- `example`: Example programs\n\n## Supported Unitree sdk2 Messages:\n**Current version only supports low-level development, mainly used for sim to real verification of controller**\n- `LowCmd`: Motor control commands\n- `LowState`: Motor state information\n- `SportModeState`: Robot position and velocity data\n- `IMUState`: Torso IMU state at `rt/secondary_imu` topic (G1 only)\n\nNote:\n1. The numbering of the motors corresponds to the actual robot hardware. Specific details can be found in the [Unitree documentation](https://support.unitree.com/home/zh/developer).\n2. In the actual robot hardware, the `SportModeState` message is not readable after the built-in motion control service is turned off. However, the simulator retains this message to allow users to utilize the position and velocity information for analyzing the developed control programs.\n\n## Related links\n- [unitree_sdk2](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2)\n- [unitree_sdk2_python](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python)\n- [unitree_ros2](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros2)\n- [Unitree Doc](https://support.unitree.com/home/zh/developer)\n- [Mujoco Doc](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html)\n\n## Message (DDS idl) type description\n- Unitree Go2, B2, H1, B2w, Go2w robots use unitree_go idl for low-level communication.\n- Unitree G1, H1-2 robot uses unitree_hg idl for low-level communication.\n\n\n# Installation\n## C++ Simulator (simulate)\n### 1. Dependencies\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install libyaml-cpp-dev libspdlog-dev libboost-all-dev libglfw3-dev\n```\n\n#### unitree_sdk2\nIt is recommended to install `unitree_sdk2` in `/opt/unitree_robotics` path.\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2.git\ncd unitree_sdk2/\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/unitree_robotics\nsudo make install\n```\nFor more details, see: https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2\n#### mujoco\n\nDownload the mujoco [release](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco/releases), and extract it to the `~/.mujoco` directory;\n\n```\ncd unitree_mujoco/simulate/\nln -s ~/.mujoco/mujoco-3.3.6 mujoco\n```\n\n### 2. Compile unitree_mujoco\n```bash\ncd unitree_mujoco/simulate\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake ..\nmake -j4\n```\n### 3. Test:\nRun:\n```bash\n./unitree_mujoco -r go2 -s scene_terrain.xml\n```\nYou should see the mujoco simulator with the Go2 robot loaded.\nIn a new terminal, run:\n```bash\n./test\n```\nThe program will output the robot's pose and position information in the simulator, and each motor of the robot will continuously output 1Nm of torque.\n\n**Note:** The testing program sends the unitree_go message. If you want to test G1 robot, you need to modify the program to use the unitree_hg message.\n\n## Python Simulator (simulate_python)\n### 1. Dependencies\n#### unitree_sdk2_python\n```bash\ncd ~\nsudo apt install python3-pip\ngit clone https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python.git\ncd unitree_sdk2_python\npip3 install -e .\n```\nIf you encounter an error during installation:\n```bash\nCould not locate cyclonedds. Try to set CYCLONEDDS_HOME or CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\n```\nRefer to: https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python\n#### mujoco-python\n```bash\npip3 install mujoco\n```\n\n#### joystick\n```bash\npip3 install pygame\n```\n\n### 2. Test\n```bash\ncd ./simulate_python\npython3 ./unitree_mujoco.py\n```\nYou should see the mujoco simulator with the Go2 robot loaded.\nIn a new terminal, run:\n```bash\npython3 ./test/test_unitree_sdk2.py\n```\nThe program will output the robot's pose and position information in the simulator, and each motor of the robot will continuously output 1Nm of torque.\n\n**Note:** The testing program sends the unitree_go message. If you want to test G1 robot, you need to modify the program to use the unitree_hg message.\n\n\n# Usage\n## 1. Simulation Configuration\n### C++ Simulator\nThe configuration file for the C++ simulator is located at `/simulate/config.yaml`:\n```yaml\n# Robot name loaded by the simulator\n# \"go2\", \"b2\", \"b2w\", \"h1\"\nrobot: \"go2\"\n# Robot simulation scene file\n# For example, for go2, it refers to the scene.xml file in the /unitree_robots/go2/ folder\nrobot_scene: \"scene.xml\"\n# DDS domain id, it is recommended to distinguish from the real robot (default is 0 on the real robot)\ndomain_id: 1\n\nuse_joystick: 1 # Simulate Unitree WirelessController using a gamepad\njoystick_type: \"xbox\" # support \"xbox\" and \"switch\" gamepad layout\njoystick_device: \"/dev/input/js0\" # Device path\njoystick_bits: 16 # Some game controllers may only have 8-bit accuracy\n\n# Network interface name, for simulation, it is recommended to use the local loopback \"lo\"\ninterface: \"lo\"\n# Whether to output robot link, joint, sensor information, 1 for output\nprint_scene_information: 1\n# Whether to use virtual tape, 1 to enable\n# Mainly used to simulate the hanging process of H1 robot initialization\nenable_elastic_band: 0 # For H1\n```\n### Python Simulator\nThe configuration file for the Python simulator is located at `/simulate_python/config.py`:\n```python\n# Robot name loaded by the simulator\n# \"go2\", \"b2\", \"b2w\", \"h1\"\nROBOT = \"go2\"\n# Robot simulation scene file\nROBOT_SCENE = \"../unitree_robots/\" + ROBOT + \"/scene.xml\"  # Robot scene\n# DDS domain id, it is recommended to distinguish from the real robot (default is 0 on the real robot)\nDOMAIN_ID = 1  # Domain id\n# Network interface name, for simulation, it is recommended to use the local loopback \"lo\"\nINTERFACE = \"lo\"  # Interface\n# Whether to output robot link, joint, sensor information, True for output\nPRINT_SCENE_INFORMATION = True\n\nUSE_JOYSTICK = 1 # Simulate Unitree WirelessController using a gamepad\nJOYSTICK_TYPE = \"xbox\" # support \"xbox\" and \"switch\" gamepad layout\nJOYSTICK_DEVICE = 0 # Joystick number\n\n# Whether to use virtual tape, 1 to enable\n# Mainly used to simulate the hanging process of H1 robot initialization\nENABLE_ELASTIC_BAND = False\n# Simulation time step (unit: s)\n# To ensure the reliability of the simulation, it needs to be greater than the time required for viewer.sync() to render once\nSIMULATE_DT = 0.003  \n# Visualization interface runtime step, 0.02 corresponds to 50fps/s\nVIEWER_DT = 0.02\n```\n### Joystick\nThe simulator will use an Xbox or Switch gamepad  to simulate the wireless controller of the robot. The button and joystick information of the wireless controller will be published through \"rt/wireless_controller\" topic. `use_joystick/USE_JOYSTICK` in `config.yaml/config.py` needs to be set to 0, when there is no gamepad. If your gamepad is not in Xbox or Switch layout, you can modify it in the source code (The button and joystick IDs can be  determined  using `jstest`):\n\nIn `simulate/src/unitree_sdk2_bridge/unitree_sdk2_bridge.cc`: \n```C++\n if (js_type == \"xbox\")\n{\n    js_id_.axis[\"LX\"] = 0; // Left stick axis x\n    js_id_.axis[\"LY\"] = 1; // Left stick axis y\n    js_id_.axis[\"RX\"] = 3; // Right stick axis x\n    js_id_.axis[\"RY\"] = 4; // Right stick axis y\n    js_id_.axis[\"LT\"] = 2; // Left trigger\n    js_id_.axis[\"RT\"] = 5; // Right trigger\n    js_id_.axis[\"DX\"] = 6; // Directional pad x\n    js_id_.axis[\"DY\"] = 7; // Directional pad y\n\n    js_id_.button[\"X\"] = 2;\n    js_id_.button[\"Y\"] = 3;\n    js_id_.button[\"B\"] = 1;\n    js_id_.button[\"A\"] = 0;\n    js_id_.button[\"LB\"] = 4;\n    js_id_.button[\"RB\"] = 5;\n    js_id_.button[\"SELECT\"] = 6;\n    js_id_.button[\"START\"] = 7;\n}\n```\n\nIn `simulate_python/unitree_sdk2_bridge.py`: \n```python\nif js_type == \"xbox\":\n    self.axis_id = {\n        \"LX\": 0,  # Left stick axis x\n        \"LY\": 1,  # Left stick axis y\n        \"RX\": 3,  # Right stick axis x\n        \"RY\": 4,  # Right stick axis y\n        \"LT\": 2,  # Left trigger\n        \"RT\": 5,  # Right trigger\n        \"DX\": 6,  # Directional pad x\n        \"DY\": 7,  # Directional pad y\n    }\n\n    self.button_id = {\n        \"X\": 2,\n        \"Y\": 3,\n        \"B\": 1,\n        \"A\": 0,\n        \"LB\": 4,\n        \"RB\": 5,\n        \"SELECT\": 6,\n        \"START\": 7,\n    }\n```\n\n### Elastic band for humanoid \nConsider humanoid robots are not suitable for starting in ground, a virtual elastic band was designed to simulate the lifting and lowering of humanoid robots. Setting ` enable_elastic_mand/ENABLE_ELSTIC_BAND=1 ` can enable the virtual elastic band. After loading the robot, press' 9 'to activate or release the strap, press' 7' to lower the robot, and press' 8 'to lift the robot.\n\n## 2. Terrain Generation Tool\nWe provide a tool to parametrically create simple terrains in the mujoco simulator, including stairs, rough ground, and height maps. The program is located in the `terrain_tool` folder. For specific usage instructions, refer to the README file in the `terrain_tool` folder.\n![Terrain Generation Example](./doc/terrain.png)\n\n## 3. Sim to Real\nThe `example` folder contains simple examples of using different interfaces to make the Go2 robot stand up and then lie down. These examples demonstrate how to implement the transition from simulation to reality using interfaces provided by Unitree. Here is an explanation of each folder name:\n- `cpp`: Based on C++, using `unitree_sdk2` interface\n- `python`: Based on Python, using  `unitree_sdk2_python` interface\n- `ros2`: Based on ROS2, using `unitree_ros2` interface\n\n### unitree_sdk2\n1. Compile\n```bash\ncd example/cpp\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake ..\nmake -j4\n```\n2. Run:\n```bash\n./stand_go2 # Control the robot in the simulation (make sure the Go2 simulation scene has been loaded)\n./stand_go2 enp3s0 # Control the physical robot, where enp3s0 is the name of the network card connected to the robot\n```\n3.

      "readme": "# swirl courses\n\nThis is a collection of interactive courses for use with the [swirl R package](http://swirlstats.com). You'll find instructions for installing courses further down on this page. Some courses are still in development and we'd love to hear any [suggestions](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/issues/new) you have as you work through them.\n\nFor more information regarding swirl, visit [swirlstats.com](http://swirlstats.com) or the [swirl GitHub repository](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl). If you'd like to write your own interactive content, please visit the [Instructors page](http://swirlstats.com/instructors.html) of our website.\n\nHere are our current offerings, organized by level of difficulty:\n\n#### Beginner\n\n- **R Programming**: The basics of programming in R\n- [**R Programming E**](https://github.com/swirldev/R_Programming_E): Same as the original, but modified slightly for in-class use (see below ***)\n- [**The R Programming Environment**](https://swirlstats.com/scn/rpe.html)\n<!-- - **Data Analysis**: Basic ideas in statistics and data visualization -->\n<!-- - **Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp**: One- and two-sample t-tests, power, and sample size -->\n<!-- - **Open Intro**: A very basic introduction to statistics, data analysis, and data visualization -->\n\n\\*\\*\\* *R Programming E is identical to R Programming, except we've eliminated the prompts for Coursera credentials at the end of each lesson and instead give students the option to send an email to their instructor notifying them of completion. Admittedly, it's sort of a hack until we come up with a more robust solution for in-class use (i.e. an instructor \"dashboard\").*\n\n#### Intermediate\n\n- **Regression Models**: The basics of regression modeling in R\n- **Getting and Cleaning Data**: dplyr, tidyr, lubridate, oh my!\n\n#### Advanced\n\n- **Statistical Inference**: This intermediate to advanced level course closely follows the\n[Statistical Inference course](https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference) of the Johns Hopkins \n[Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) on Coursera. It\nintroduces the student to basic concepts of statistical inference\nincluding probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and\np-values. It concludes with an initiation to topics of particular\nrelevance to big data, issues of multiple testing and resampling.\n- [**Advanced R Programming**](https://swirlstats.com/scn/arp.html)\n\nSince our users come from a variety backgrounds, it's very hard to label material as **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced**. If you find something that is labelled **Beginner** to be challenging, please don't be discouraged. The first step of learning anything is to acknowledge that you are capable of understanding it. True understanding will come with time and practice.\n\n#### Course Authors\n\n- **Writing swirl Courses**: An interactive guides and example \n  for swirl course authors. The first group of lessons cover basics. The rest cover \n  special topics useful primarily as samples--points of departure for one's own material.\n  For more comprehensive documentation about writing your own swirl courses see http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/.\n\n## Install and run a course automatically from swirl\n\n**This is the preferred method of installing courses.** It automates the process by allowing you to do everything right from the R console.\n\n1) Make sure you have a recent version version of swirl:\n\n```\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\")\n```\n\n2) Enter the following from the R console, **substituting the name of the course** that you wish to install:\n\n```\nlibrary(swirl)\ninstall_course(\"Course Name Here\")\nswirl()\n```\n\nFor example, `install_course(\"R Programming\")` will install the R Programming course. **Please note that course names are case sensitive!**\n\nIf that doesn't work for you...\n\n## Install and run a course manually\n\nIf the automatic course installation method outlined above does not work for you, then there's a simple alternative.\n\n1. Find the course you want to install on the [Swirl Course network website](https://swirlstats.com/scn/title.html).\n2. Follow the manual installation instructions on the course page.\n\nIf that does not work for you, consider taking a look at the \n[legacy manual install instructions](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/wiki/Legacy-Manual-Install-Instructions-for-Swirl-Courses).\n\n## Uninstall a course\n\nIf you'd like to remove a course at any time, you can use `uninstall_course(\"Course Name Here\")`.\n\n## Using swirl in the classroom\n\nInstructors around the world are using swirl in their classrooms. We think this is awesome. If you're an instructor, please feel free to do the same -- free of charge. While your students may be paying to take your course or attend your institution, we simply ask that you don't charge people *directly* for the use of our software or instructional content.\n\nIf you are not sure about a particular use case, don't hesitate to post a\nquestion to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swirl-discuss).\n",

In addition, it removes the need\nto run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support\nopen-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to\nmultiple open-source or commercial back-ends.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.\n- Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.\n- Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.\n- Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.\n- Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.\n\n## Community\n\nThe OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the [#otel-collector](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W)\nchannel on the CNCF Slack and [meets once a week](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs) via\nvideo calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:\n\n- meet the humans behind the project\n- get an opinion about specific proposals\n- look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack\n- get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously\n\nWe rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to\nallow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:\n\nTuesday:\n\n- [17:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700)\n\nWednesday:\n\n- [09:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900)\n- [05:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500)\n\nContributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points.\nPost a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong\nreasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to\nidentify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.\n\nRemember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the\nrelevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull\nrequest where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous\ncalls and don't want them to feel excluded.\n\n## Supported OTLP version\n\nThis code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0,\nconsidered Stable. [See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability\ndefinition\nhere.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition)\n\n## Stability levels\n\nSee [Stability Levels and versioning](docs/component-stability.md) for more details.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nWhen used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).\nRemoving support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.\n\nSupport for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:\n\n1. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.\n2. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will remove support for Go version `N-2`.\n\nOfficial OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.\n\n## Verifying the images signatures\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To verify a signed artifact or blob, first [install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/), then follow the instructions below.\n\nWe are signing the images `otel/opentelemetry-collector` and `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` using [sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:\n\n```console\n$ cosign verify \\\n  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/<RELEASE_TAG> \\\n  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \\\n  <OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE>\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n- `<RELEASE_TAG>`: is the release that you want to validate\n- `<OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE>`: is the image that you want to check\n\nExample:\n\n```console\n$ cosign verify --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/v0.98.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0\n\nVerification for ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0 --\nThe following checks were performed on each of these signatures:\n  - The cosign claims were validated\n  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline\n  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates\n\n[{\"critical\":{\"identity\":{\"docker-reference\":\"ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib\"},\"image\":{\"docker-manifest-digest\":\"sha256:5cea85bcbc734a3c0a641368e5a4ea9d31b472997e9f2feca57eeb4a147fcf1a\"},\"type\":\"cosign

In addition to adjusting white space it can insert or remove implicit `self`, remove redundant parentheses, and correct many other deviations from the standard Swift idioms.\n\n\nWhy would I want to do that?\n-----------------------------\n\nMany programmers have a preferred style for formatting their code, and others seem entirely blind to the existing formatting conventions of a project (to the enragement of their colleagues).\n\nWhen collaborating on a project, it can be helpful to agree on a common coding style, but enforcing that manually is tedious and error-prone, and can lead to arguments if some participants take it more seriously than others.\n\nHaving a tool to automatically enforce a common style eliminates those issues, and lets you focus on the behavior of the code, not its presentation.\n\n\nHow do I install it?\n---------------------\n\nThat depends - There are several ways you can use SwiftFormat:\n\n1. As a command-line tool that you run manually, or as part of some other toolchain\n2. As a Source Editor Extension that you can invoke via the Editor > SwiftFormat menu within Xcode\n3. As a build phase in your Xcode project, so that it runs every time you press Cmd-R or Cmd-B, or\n4. As a Git pre-commit hook, so that it runs on any files you've changed before you check them in\n\n\nCommand-line tool\n-------------------\n\n**Installation:**\n\nYou can install the `swiftformat` command-line tool on macOS or Linux using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Assuming you already have Homebrew installed, just type:\n\n```bash\n$ brew install swiftformat\n```\n\nTo update to the latest version once installed:\n\n```bash\n$ brew upgrade swiftformat\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can install the tool on macOS or Linux by using [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ mint install nicklockwood/SwiftFormat\n```\n\nOr if you prefer, you can check out and build SwiftFormat manually on macOS, Linux or Windows as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat\n$ cd SwiftFormat\n$ swift build -c release\n```\n\nIf you are installing SwiftFormat into your project directory, you can use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) on macOS to automatically install the swiftformat binary along with your other pods - see the Xcode build phase instructions below for details.\n\nAnother option is to include the binary artifactbundle in your `Package.swift`:\n\n```swift\n.binaryTarget(\n    name: \"swiftformat\",\n    url: \"https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/releases/download/0.55.0/swiftformat-macos.artifactbundle.zip\",\n    checksum: \"CHECKSUM\"\n),\n``` \n\nIf you would prefer not to use a package manager, you can build the command-line app manually:\n\n1. open `SwiftFormat.xcodeproj` and build the `SwiftFormat (Application)` scheme.\n\n2. Drag the `swiftformat` binary into `/usr/local/bin/` (this is a hidden folder, but you can use the Finder's `Go > Go to Folder...` menu to open it).\n\n3. Open `~/.bash_profile` in your favorite text editor (this is a hidden file, but you can type `open ~/.bash_profile` in the terminal to open it).\n\n4. Add the following line to the file: `alias swiftformat=\"/usr/local/bin/swiftformat --indent 4\"` (you can omit the `--indent 4`, or replace it with something else. Run `swiftformat --help` to see the available options).\n\n5. Save the `.bash_profile` file and run the command `source ~/.bash_profile` for the changes to take effect.\n\n**Usage:**\n\nIf you followed the installation instructions above, you can now just type\n\n```bash\n$ swiftformat .\n```\n\n(that's a space and then a period after the command) in the terminal to format any Swift files in the current directory. In place of the `.`, you can instead type an absolute or relative path to the file or directory that you want to format.\n\n**WARNING:** `swiftformat .` will overwrite any Swift files it finds in the current directory, and any subfolders therein. If you run it in your home directory, it will probably reformat every Swift file on your hard drive.\n\nTo use it safely, do the following:\n\n1. Choose a file or directory that you want to apply the changes to.\n\n2. Make sure that you have committed all your changes to that code safely in git (or whatever source control system you use).\n\n3. (Optional) In Terminal, type `swiftformat --infer-options \"/path/to/your/code/\"`. This will suggest a set of formatting options to use that match your existing project style (but you are free to ignore these and use the defaults, or your own settings if you prefer).\n\n    The path can point to either a single Swift file or a directory of files. It can be either be absolute, or relative to the current directory. The `\"\"` quotes around the path are optional, but if the path contains spaces then you either need to use quotes, or escape each space with `\\`. You may include multiple paths separated by spaces.\n\n4. In Terminal, type `swiftformat \"/path/to/your/code/\"`. The same rules apply as above with respect to paths, and multiple space-delimited paths are allowed.\n\n    If you used `--infer-options` to generate a suggested set of options in step 3, you should copy and paste them into the command, either before or after the path(s) to your source files.\n\n    If you have created a [config file](#config-file), you can specify its path using `--config \"/path/to/your/config-file/\"`. Alternatively, if you name the file `.swiftformat` and place it inside the project you are formatting, it will be picked up automatically.\n\n5. Press enter to begin formatting. Once the formatting is complete, use your source control system to check the changes, and verify that no undesirable changes have been introduced. If they have, revert the changes, tweak the options and try again.\n\n6. (Optional) commit the changes.\n\nFollowing these instructions *should* ensure that you avoid catastrophic data loss, but in the unlikely event that it wipes your hard drive, **please note that I accept no responsibility**.\n\n**Using Standard Input/Output:**\n\nIf you prefer, you can use unix pipes to include SwiftFormat as part of a command chain. For example, this is an alternative way to format a file:\n\n```bash\n$ cat /path/to/file.swift | swiftformat --output /path/to/file.swift\n```\n\nOmitting the `--output /path/to/file.swift` will print the formatted file to Standard Output (stdout). You can also pass \"stdout\" explicitly as the output path:\n\n```bash\n$ cat /path/to/file.swift | swiftformat --output stdout\n```\n\nOr you can use `>` to specify the output path as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ cat /path/to/file.swift | swiftformat > /path/to/file.swift\n```\n\nIf you do not supply an input file, SwiftFormat will automatically take its input from Standard Input (stdin), but will time-out if no input is received immediately and display the help screen. To make it explicit, pass \"stdin\" as the input path:\n\n```bash\n$ cat /path/to/file.swift | swiftformat stdin\n```\n\nWhen using stdin, SwiftFormat does not have access to the file path of the input, so features that rely on the file location (such as inserting the creation date into header comments, or detecting `.swiftformat` configuration files in the file path) will not work. To solve this, you can provide the file path using the `--stdin-path` argument:\n\n```bash\n$ cat /path/to/file.swift | swiftformat stdin --stdinpath /path/to/file.swift\n```\n\n\nXcode source editor extension\n-----------------------------\n\n**Installation:**\n\nLike the command-line tool, you can install the SwiftFormat for Xcode extension application via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Assuming you already have Homebrew installed, type:\n\n```bash\n$ brew install --cask swiftformat-for-xcode\n```\n\nThis will install SwiftFormat for Xcode in your Applications folder. Double-click the app to launch it, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n**NOTE:** The app should be correctly signed, but if you get a Gatekeeper warning when trying to open it you can bypass this by right-clicking (or control-clicking) the app and selecting `Open`.\n\nTo update to the latest version once installed use:\n\n```bash\n$ brew upgrade --cask swiftformat-for-xcode\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer not to use Homebrew, you'll find the latest version of the SwiftFormat for Xcode application on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/releases) page. Download and unpack the zip archive, then drag `SwiftFormat for Xcode.app` into your `Applications` folder.\n\n**Usage:**\n\nOnce you have launched the app and restarted Xcode, you'll find a SwiftFormat option under Xcode's Editor menu. If the SwiftFormat menu does not appear [this thread](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/issues/494) may help. \n\nYou can configure the formatting [rules](#rules) and [options](#options) using the SwiftFormat for Xcode host application. There is currently no way to override these per-project, however, you can import and export different configurations using the File menu. You will need to do this again each time you switch projects.\n\nThe format of the configuration file is described in the [Config section](#config-file) below.\n\n**Note:** SwiftFormat for Xcode cannot automatically detect changes to an imported configuration file. If you update the `.swiftformat` file for your project, you will need to manually re-import that file into SwiftFormat for Xcode in order for the Xcode source editor extension to use the new configuration.\n\n\nXcode build phase\n-------------------\n\n**NOTE:** Adding this script will overwrite your source files as you work on them, which has the annoying side-effect of clearing the undo history. You may wish to add the script to your test target rather than your main target, so that it is invoked only when you run the unit tests, and not every time you build the app.\n\nAlternatively, you might want to consider running SwiftFormat in [lint](#linting) mode as part of your normal build, and then running a formatting pass manually, or as part of a less-frequent build target (such as the tests).\n\n### Using Swift Package Manager\n\nTo set up SwiftFormat as an Xcode build phase, do the following:\n\n#### 1) Create a BuildTools folder and Package.swift\n\n1. Create a folder called `BuildTools` in the same folder as your xcodeproj file\n2. In this folder, create a file called `Package.swift`, with the following contents:\n```swift\n// swift-tools-version:5.1\nimport PackageDescription\n\nlet package = Package(\n    name: \"BuildTools\",\n    platforms: [.macOS(.v10_11)],\n    dependencies: [\n        .package(url: \"https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat\", from: \"0.58.7\"),\n    ],\n    targets: [.target(name: \"BuildTools\", path: \"\")]\n)\n```\n3. If you are running Xcode 11.4 or later, in the `BuildTools` folder create a file called `Empty.swift` with nothing in it. This is to satisfy a change in Swift Package Manager.\n\n#### 2) Add a Build phase to your app target\n\n1. Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab\n2. Add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left\n3. Uncheck the `Based on dependency analysis` checkbox\n4. Drag the new `Run Script` phase **above** the `Compile Sources` phase, expand it and paste the following script:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd BuildTools\n    SDKROOT=(xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path)\n    #swift package update #Uncomment this line temporarily to update the version used to the latest matching your BuildTools/Package.swift file\n    swift run -c release swiftformat \"$SRCROOT\"\n    ```\n\nYou can also use `swift run -c release --package-path BuildTools swiftformat \"$SRCROOT\"` if you need a more complex script and `cd BuildTools` breaks stuff.\n\n**NOTE:** You may wish to check BuildTools/Package.swift into your source control so that the version used by your run-script phase is kept in version control. It is recommended to add the following to your .gitignore file: `BuildTools/.build` and `BuildTools/.swiftpm`.\n\n**NOTE (2):** If you are using Xcode 15 or later, make sure that the `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING` (aka \"User Script Sandboxing\") option is set to NO, otherwise SwiftFormat won't be able to run correctly.\n\n### Using CocoaPods\n\n#### 1) Add the SwiftFormat CLI to your Podfile\n\n1. Add the `swiftformat` binary to your project directory via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), by adding the following line to your Podfile then running `pod install`:\n\n    ```ruby\n    pod 'SwiftFormat/CLI', '~> 0.58.7'\n    ```\n\n**NOTE:** This will only install the pre-built command-line app, not the source code for the SwiftFormat framework.\n\n**NOTE (2):** When installing this way, GateKeeper may block swiftformat from running until you open it manually the first time by right-clicking in the Finder and selecting \"Open\".\n\n#### 2) Add a Build phase to your app target\n\n1. Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under `TARGETS`, click the `Build Phases` tab\n2. Add a `New Run Script Phase` by clicking the little plus icon in the top left\n3. Uncheck the `Based on dependency analysis` checkbox\n4. Drag the new `Run Script` phase **above** the `Compile Sources` phase, expand it and paste the following script:\n\n    ```bash\n    \"${PODS_ROOT}/SwiftFormat/CommandLineTool/swiftformat\" \"$SRCROOT\"\n    ```\n\n### Alternative: Locally installed SwiftFormat\n\nAlternatively, you could use a locally installed swiftformat command-line tool instead by putting the following in your Run Script build phase:\n\n```bash\nif which swiftformat >/dev/null; then\n  swiftformat .\nelse\n  echo \"warning: SwiftFormat not installed, download from https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat\"\nfi\n```\n\nThis is not recommended for shared projects however, as different team members using different versions of SwiftFormat may result in noise in the commit history as code gets reformatted inconsistently.\n\nIf you installed SwiftFormat via Homebrew on Apple Silicon, you might experience this warning:\n\n> warning: SwiftFormat not installed, download from https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat\n\nThat is because Homebrew on Apple Silicon installs the binaries into the `/opt/homebrew/bin`\nfolder by default. To instruct Xcode where to find SwiftFormat, you can either add\n`/opt/homebrew/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable in your build phase\n\n```bash\nif [[ \"$(uname -m)\" == arm64 ]]; then\n    export PATH=\"/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nif which swiftformat > /dev/null; then\n  swiftformat .\nelse\n  echo \"warning: SwiftFormat not installed, download from https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat\"\nfi\n```\n\nor you can create a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin` pointing to the actual binary:\n\n```bash\nln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/swiftformat /usr/local/bin/swiftformat\n```\n\nSwift Package Manager plugin\n-----------------------------\n\nYou can use `SwiftFormat` as a SwiftPM command plugin.\n\n**NOTE:** Swift 5.6 or higher is required. Add the package to your dependencies in your `Package.swift` file.\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    // ...\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat\", from: \"0.58.7\"),\n]\n```\n\nThe plugin will find an existing `.swiftformat` in your package root folder and honor it automatically.\n\n### Trigger Plugin From Command-Line\n\n```bash\nswift package plugin --allow-writing-to-package-directory swiftformat\n```\n\nYou can limit the formatting to a particular target with `--target` option.\n\nYou can also specify `SwiftFormat` arguments, e.g. `--swift-version`.\n\nExample\n\n```bash\nswift package plugin --allow-writing-to-package-directory swiftformat --target MyLibrary --swift-version 5.6 --verbose\n```\n\n### Trigger Plugin From Xcode\n\nIn Xcode 14 you can trigger the command plugin execution for a Swift package or an Xcode project.\n\nFor an Xcode project the project's main directory will be processed and the `--target` option will be ignored.\n\nYou can also specify `SwiftFormat` arguments, e.g. `--swift-version`.\n\n![Run plugin in Xcode 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4176826/179352584-db7f7f42-452c-4a42-a329-01b115a237a7.gif)\n\nVia AppleScript\n----------------\n\nTo run SwiftFormat on the frontmost Xcode document (project or workspace) you can use the following AppleScript:\n\n```applescript\ntell application \"Xcode\"\n    set frontWindow to the first window\n    set myPath to path of document of frontWindow\n    do shell script \"cd \" & myPath & \";cd ..; /usr/local/bin/swiftformat .\"\nend tell\n```\n\nSome Apps you can trigger this from are [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai), [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) or [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/). Another option is to define a QuickAction for Xcode via Automator and then assign a keyboard shortcut for it in the System Preferences.\n\n\nVSCode plugin\n--------------\n\nIf you prefer to use Microsoft's [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor for writing Swift, [Valentin Knabel](https://github.com/vknabel) has created a [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vknabel.vscode-swiftformat) for SwiftFormat.\n\n\nSublime Text plugin\n--------------------\n\nIf you prefer to use the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) editor, try the [Sublime-Swift-Format plugin](https://github.com/aerobounce/Sublime-Swift-Format) by [Aerobounce](https://github.com/aerobounce).\n\n\nNova plugin\n-----------\n\nIf you prefer to use the [Nova](https://panic.com/nova) editor, try the [SwiftFormat extension](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/org.padraig/org.padraig.SwiftFormat/) by [Pádraig Ó Cinnéide](https://mastodon.social/@PadraigOCinneide).\n\n\nGit pre-commit hook\n---------------------\n\n1. Follow the instructions for installing the SwiftFormat command-line tool.\n\n2. Install [git-format-staged](https://github.com/hallettj/git-format-staged).\n\n3. Edit or create a `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file in your project folder. The .git folder is hidden but should already exist if you are using Git with your project, so open it with the terminal, or the Finder's `Go > Go to Folder...` menu.\n\n4. Add the following line in the pre-commit file. The `{}` will be replaced automatically by the path to the Swift file being formatted:\n\n    ```bash\n    #!/bin/bash\n    git-format-staged --formatter \"swiftformat stdin --stdin-path '{}'\" \"*.swift\"\n    ```\n    \n    (Note that this example uses your locally installed version of SwiftFormat, not a separate copy in your project repository. You can replace `swiftformat` with the path to a copy inside your project if you prefer.)\n    \n5. enable the hook by typing `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit` in the terminal.\n \nThe pre-commit hook will now run whenever you run `git commit`. Running `git commit --no-verify` will skip the pre-commit hook.\n\n**NOTE:** If you are using Git via a GUI client such as [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com), [additional steps](https://www.git-tower.com/help/mac/faq-and-tips/faq/hook-scripts) may be needed.\n\n**NOTE (2):** Unlike the Xcode build phase approach, git pre-commit hook won't be checked in to source control, and there's no way to guarantee that all users of the project are using the same version of SwiftFormat. For a collaborative project, you might want to consider a *post*-commit hook instead, which would run on your continuous integration server.\n\nGitHub Actions\n---------------------\n\n1. SwiftFormat comes preinstalled on all macOS GitHub-hosted runners. If you are self hosting you will need to ensure SwiftFormat is installed on your runner.\n2. Create a GitHub Actions workflow using SwiftFormat, passing the `--reporter github-actions-log` command line option. The following example action lints pull requests using SwiftFormat, reporting warnings using the GitHub Actions log.\n```yaml\n# Lint.yml\nname: Lint\non: pull_request\n\njobs:\n  Lint:\n    runs-on: macos-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - name: SwiftFormat\n        run: swiftformat --lint . --reporter github-actions-log\n```\n\nOn CI using Danger\n-------------------\n\nTo setup SwiftFormat to be used by your continuous integration system using [Danger](http://danger.systems/ruby/), do the following:\n\n1. Follow the [`instructions`](http://danger.systems/guides/getting_started.html) to setup Danger.\n2. Add the [`danger-swiftformat`](https://github.com/garriguv/danger-ruby-swiftformat) plugin to your `Gemfile`.\n3. Add the following to your `Dangerfile`:\n\n    ```ruby\n    swiftformat.binary_path = \"/path/to/swiftformat\" # optional\n    swiftformat.additional_args = \"--indent tab --self insert\" # optional\n    swiftformat.check_format(fail_on_error: true)\n    ```\n\n    **NOTE:** It is recommended to add the `swiftformat` binary to your project directory to ensure the same version is used each time (see the [Xcode build phase](#xcode-build-phase) instructions above).\n\n\nBazel Build\n-----------\n\nIf you use [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) to build your Swift projects and want to ensure that only properly formatted code is merged to your main branch, try [rules_swiftformat](https://github.com/cgrindel/rules_swiftformat). The repository contains Bazel rules and macros that format Swift source files using SwiftFormat, test that the formatted files exist in the workspace directory, and copy the formatted files to the workspace directory.\n\n\nDocker\n-----------\n\nSwiftFormat publishes releases into [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) Docker registry. To pull the image call:\n\n```bash\n$ docker pull ghcr.io/nicklockwood/swiftformat:latest\n```\n\nBy default, the container runs `swiftformat .` Therefore, you need to provide a path either via an argument:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -v /local/source/path:/work ghcr.io/nicklockwood/swiftformat:latest /work\n```\n\nor by changing the working dir:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -v /local/source/path:/work -w /work ghcr.io/nicklockwood/swiftformat:latest\n```\n\nTo check the installed SwiftFormat version:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm ghcr.io/nicklockwood/swiftformat:latest --version\n```\n\nLinting example:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -v /local/source/path:/work ghcr.io/nicklockwood/swiftformat:latest /work --lint\n```\n\nPrerelease Builds\n-----------------\n\n***Prerelease builds are subject to breaking changes.***\n\nNew rules, options, and fixes are merged to the [`develop`](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/commits/develop/) branch before being incorporated into an official release. You may want to use a prerelease version of SwiftFormat that includes the latest unreleased changes.\n\n**Homebrew:**\n\nThe [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) `--HEAD` option downloads, builds, and installs the latest changes from the `develop` branch. \n\nYou can install a prerelease build via Homebrew by running:\n\n```bash\n$ brew install swiftformat --HEAD\n```\n\n**Nightly Builds:**\n\nNightly builds of the `develop` branch are available in the [calda/SwiftFormat-nightly](https://github.com/calda/SwiftFormat-nightly) repo. A new release is published every day, unless there have been no changes to `develop` since the last release. You can download executables for the latest nightly release [here](https://github.com/calda/SwiftFormat-nightly/releases/latest).\n\nCommit SHAs on `develop` are unstable since that branch is occasionally rebased, but artifact URLs and tags in [calda/SwiftFormat-nightly](https://github.com/calda/SwiftFormat-nightly) are stable references that can be used from other repos or tools.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nSwiftFormat's configuration is split between **rules** and **options**. Rules are functions in the SwiftFormat library that apply changes to the code. Options are settings that control the behavior of the rules. \n\n\nOptions\n-------\n\nThe options available in SwiftFormat can be displayed using the `--options` command-line argument. The default value for each option is indicated in the help text.\n\nRules are configured by adding `--[option_name] [value]` to your command-line arguments, or by creating a `.swiftformat` [config file](#config-file) and placing it in your project directory.\n\nA given option may affect multiple rules. Use `--rule-info [rule_name]` command for details about which options affect a given rule, or see the [Rules.md](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/blob/main/Rules.md) file.\n\nYou can configure options for specific files or code ranges by using `swiftformat:options` directive in comments inside your Swift file. To temporarily set one or more options inside a source file, use:\n\n```swift\n// swiftformat:options --indent 2 --allman true\n```\n\nTo apply an options override only to a particular line, use the `:this`, `:next` or `:previous` modifiers:\n\n```swift\nlet indexUrl: URL // swiftformat:options:this --preserve-acronyms url \n\n// swiftformat:options:next --semicolons inline\ndoTheThing(); print(\"Did the thing\")\n```\n\n\nRules\n-----\n\nSwiftFormat includes over 50 rules, and new ones are added all the time. An up-to-date list can be found in [Rules.md](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/blob/main/Rules.md) along with documentation for how they are used.\n\nThe list of available rules can be displayed within the command-line app using the `--rules` argument. Rules can be either enabled or disabled. Most are enabled by default. Disabled rules are marked with \"(disabled)\" when displayed using `--rules`.\n\nYou can use the `--rule-info [rule_name]` command to get information about a specific rule. Pass a comma-delimited list of rule names to get information for multiple rules at once, or use `--rule-info` with no argument for info on all rules.\n\nYou can disable rules individually using `--disable` followed by a list of one or more comma-delimited rule names, or enable opt-in rules using `--enable` followed by the rule names:\n\n```bash\n--disable redundantSelf,trailingClosures\n--enable isEmpty\n```\n\nIf you prefer, you can use multiple `--enable`/`--disable` arguments instead of using commas:\n\n```bash\n--disable indent\n--disable linebreaks\n--disable redundantSelf\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the line continuation character `\\` to wrap a single argument over multiple line:\n\n```bash         \n--disable          \\\n    indent,        \\\n    linebreaks,    \\\n    redundantSelf\n```\n\nTo avoid automatically opting-in to new rules when SwiftFormat is updated, you can disable all rules using:\n\n```bash\n--disable all\n```\n\nAnd then individually enable just the rules you want. Alternatively, use the`--rules` argument to *only* enable the rules you specify:\n\n```bash\n--rules indent,linebreaks\n```\n\nAs above, you may include multiple `--rules` arguments, or use the line continuation character `\\` to wrap the rules onto separate lines:\n\n```bash\n--rules redundantSelf\n--rules         \\\n    indent,     \\\n    linebreaks\n```\n\nTo see exactly which rules were applied to a given file, you can use the `--verbose` command-line option to force SwiftFormat to print a more detailed log as it applies the formatting. **NOTE:** running in verbose mode is slower than the default mode.\n\nYou can disable rules for specific files or code ranges by using `swiftformat:` directives in comments inside your Swift file. To temporarily disable one or more rules inside a source file, use:\n\n```swift\n// swiftformat:disable <rule1> [<rule2> [rule<3> ...]]\n```\n\nTo enable the rule(s) again, use:\n\n```swift\n// swiftformat:enable <rule1> [<rule2> [rule<3> ...]]\n```\n\nTo disable all rules use:\n\n```swift\n// swiftformat:disable all\n```\n\nAnd to enable them all again, use:\n\n```swift\n// swiftformat:enable all\n```\n\nTo temporarily prevent one or more rules being applied to just the next line, use:\n\n```swift\n// swiftformat:disable:next <rule1> [<rule2> [rule<3> ...]]\nlet foo = bar // rule(s) will be disabled for this line\nlet bar = baz // rule(s) will be re-enabled for this line\n```\n\nYou can also use `this` or `previous` to enable or disable rules for the current or previous line. There is no need to manually re-enable a rule after using the `next`, `this` or `previous` directives.\n\n**NOTE:** The `swiftformat:enable` directive only serves to counter a previous `swiftformat:disable` directive in the same file. It is not possible to use `swiftformat:enable` to enable a rule that was not already enabled when formatting started.\n\n\nSwift version\n-------------\n\nMost SwiftFormat rules are version-agnostic, but some are applicable only to newer Swift versions. These rules will be disabled automatically if the Swift version is not specified, so to make sure that the full functionality is available you should specify the version of Swift that is used by your project.\n\nYou can specify the Swift compiler version in one of two ways:\n\nYou can specify your project's Swift compiler version using the `--swift-version` command line argument. You can also add the `--swift-version` option to your `.swiftformat` file.\n\nAnother option is to add a `.swift-version` file to your project directory. This is a text file that should contain the minimum Swift version supported by your project, and is also supported by some other tools. Any `.swift-version` files always take precedence over the `--swift-version` argument.\n\nBoth the `.swift-version` file and the `--swift-version` option in a `.swiftformat` file are applied hierarchically; If you have submodules in your project that use a different Swift version, you can add separate swift version configurations for those directories.\n\nSwift language mode\n-------------------\n\nSwiftFormat also allows you to specify the Swift _language mode_ used by your project. This is distinct from the Swift compiler version. For example, you can use the Swift 6.0 compiler with either the Swift 5 language mode or the Swift 6 language mode. Some SwiftFormat rules will behave differently under different Swift language modes.\n\nYou can specify your project's Swift language mode using the `--language-mode` command line argument. You can also add the `--language-mode` option to your `.swiftformat` file.\n\nIf not specified, SwiftFormat uses the default language mode of the specified Swift compiler version. The default language mode in Swift 5.x and Swift 6.x is the Swift 5 language mode. If your project uses the Swift 6 language mode, you should specify `--language-mode 6`.\n\n\nConfig file\n-----------\n\nAlthough it is possible to configure SwiftFormat directly by using the command-line [options](#options) and [rules](#rules) detailed above, it is sometimes more convenient to create a configuration file, which can be added to your project and shared with other developers.\n\nA SwiftFormat configuration file consists of one or more command-line options, split onto separate lines, e.g:\n\n```\n--allman true\n--indent tab\n--disable elseOnSameLine,semicolons\n```\n\nWhile formatting, SwiftFormat will automatically check inside each subdirectory for the presence of a `.swiftformat` file and will apply any options that it finds there to the files in that directory.\n\nThis allows you to override certain rules or formatting options just for a particular directory of files. You can also specify excluded files relative to that directory using `--exclude`, which may be more convenient than specifying them at the top-level:\n\n```\n--exclude Pods,Generated\n```\n\nThe `--exclude` option takes a comma-delimited list of file or directory paths to exclude from formatting. Excluded paths are relative to the config file containing the `--exclude` command. The excluded paths can include wildcards, specified using Unix \"Glob\" syntax, as [documented below](#globs).\n\nConfig files named \".swiftformat\" will be processed automatically, however, you can select an additional configuration file to use for formatting using the `--config \"path/to/config/file\"` command-line argument. A configuration file selected using `--config` does not need to be named \".swiftformat\", and can be located outside of the project directory.\n\nThe config file format is designed to be edited by hand. You may include blank lines for readability, and can also add comments using a hash prefix (#), e.g.\n\n```\n# format options\n--allman true\n--indent tab # tabs FTW!\n\n# file options\n--exclude Pods\n\n# rules\n--disable elseOnSameLine,semicolons\n```\n\nYou can create multiple configuration sections within a single `.swiftformat` file to apply different formatting options to different parts of your project. Each section should specify a `--filter` glob pattern to determine which files the configuration applies to. Options in that section are used when formatting files that match `--filter` glob, in addition to the base options in the file.\n\n```\n--enable indent\n--indent 4\n\n[Tests]\n--filter **/Tests/**\n--enable noForceUnwrapInTests\n--enable noForceTryInTests\n--indent 2\n```\n\nIf you would prefer not to edit the configuration file by hand, you can use the [SwiftFormat for Xcode](#xcode-source-editor-extension) app to edit the configuration and export a configuration file. You can also use the swiftformat command-line-tool's `--inferoptions` command to generate a config file from your existing project, like this:\n\n```bash\n$ cd /path/to/project\n$ swiftformat --infer-options . --output .swiftformat\n```\n\nGlobs\n-----\n\nWhen excluding files from formatting using the `--exclude` option, you may wish to make use of wildcard paths (aka \"Globs\") to match all files that match a particular naming convention without having to manually list them all.\n\nSwiftFormat's glob syntax is based on Ruby's implementation, which varies slightly from the Unix standard. The following patterns are supported:\n\n* `*` - A single star matches zero or more characters in a filename, but *not* a `/`.\n\n* `**` - A double star will match anything, including one or more `/`.\n\n* `?` - A question mark will match any single character except `/`.\n\n* `[abc]` - Matches any single character inside the brackets.\n\n* `[a-z]` - Matches a single character in the specified range in the brackets.\n\n* `{foo,bar}` - Matches any one of the comma-delimited strings inside the braces.\n\nExamples:\n\n* `foo.swift` - Matches the file \"foo.swift\" in the same directory as the config file.\n\n* `*.swift` - Matches any Swift file in the same directory as the config file.\n\n* `foo/bar.swift` - Matches the file \"bar.swift\" in the directory \"foo\".\n\n* `**/foo.swift` - Matches any file named \"foo.swift\" in the project.\n\n* `**/*.swift` - Matches any Swift file in the project.\n\n* `**/Generated` - Matches any folder called `Generated` in the project.\n\n* `**/*_generated.swift` - Matches any Swift file with the suffix \"_generated\" in the project.\n\n\nLinting\n-------\n\nSwiftFormat is primarily designed as a formatter rather than a linter, i.e. it is designed to fix your code rather than tell you what's wrong with it. However, sometimes it can be useful to verify that code has been formatted in a context where it is not desirable to actually change it.\n\nA typical example would be as part of a CI (Continuous Integration) process, where you may wish to have an automated script that checks committed code for style violations. While you can use a separate tool such as [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for this, it makes sense to be able to validate the formatting against the exact same rules as you are using to apply it.\n\nIn order to run SwiftFormat as a linter, you can use the `--lint` command-line option:\n\n```bash\n$ swiftformat --lint path/to/project\n```\n\nThis runs the same rules as format mode, and all the same configuration options apply, however, no files will be modified. Instead, SwiftFormat will format each file in memory and then compare the result against the input and report the lines that required changes.\n\nThe `--lint` option is similar to `--dry-run`, but `--lint` returns warnings for every line that required changes, and will return a nonzero error code (see [Error codes](#error-codes) below) if any changes are detected, which is useful if you want it to fail a build step on your CI server.\n\nIf you would prefer `--lint` not to fail your build, you can use the `--lenient` option to force SwiftFormat to return success in `--lint` mode even when formatting issues were detected.\n\n```bash\n$ swiftformat --lint --lenient path/to/project\n```\n\nBy default, `--lint` will only report lines that require formatting, but you can use the additional `--verbose` flag to display additional info about which files were checked, even if there were no changes needed.\n\nIf you would prefer not to see a warning for each and every formatting change, you can use the `--quiet` flag to suppress all output except errors.\n\nSometimes you may wish to autoformat some rules, but only lint others. To do that, use the `--lintonly` option in your config file to specify rules that should only be applied in `--lint` mode:\n\n```\n--rules braces,indent\n--lint-only trailingClosures,unusedArguments\n```\n\n\nError codes\n-----------\n\nThe swiftformat command-line tool will always exit with one of the following codes:\n\n* 0 - Success. This code will be returned in the event of a successful formatting run or if `--lint` detects no violations.\n* 1 - Lint failure. This code will be returned when running in `--lint` mode, or when autocorrecting in `--strict` mode, if the input requires formatting.\n* 70 - Program error. This code will be returned if there is a problem with the input or configuration arguments.\n\n\nCache\n------\n\nSwiftFormat uses a cache file to avoid reformatting files that haven't changed. For a large project, this can significantly reduce processing time.\n\nBy default, the cache is stored in `~/Library/Caches/com.charcoaldesign.swiftformat` on macOS, or `/tmp/com.charcoaldesign.swiftformat` on Linux. Use the command-line option `--cache ignore` to ignore the cached version and re-apply formatting to all files. Alternatively, you can use `--cache clear` to delete the cache (or you can just manually delete the cache file).\n\nThe cache is shared between all projects. The file is fairly small, as it only stores the path and size for each file, not the contents. If you do start experiencing slowdown due to the cache growing too large, you might want to consider using a separate cache file for each project.\n\nYou can specify a custom cache file location by passing a path as the `--cache` option value. For example, you might want to store the cache file inside your project directory. It is fine to check in the cache file if you want to share it between different users of your project, as the paths stored in the cache are relative to the location of the formatted files.\n\n\nFile headers\n-------------\n\nSwiftFormat can be configured to strip or replace the header comments in every file with a template. The \"header comment\" is defined as a comment block that begins on the first nonblank line in the file, and is followed by at least one blank line. This may consist of a single comment body, or multiple comments on consecutive lines:\n\n```swift\n// This is a header comment\n```\n\n```swift\n// This is a regular comment\nfunc foo(bar: Int) -> Void { ... }\n```\n\nThe header template is a string that you provide using the `--header` command-line option. Passing a value of `ignore` (the default) will leave the header comments unmodified. Passing `strip` or an empty string `\"\"` will remove them. If you wish to provide a custom header template, the format is as follows:\n\nFor a single-line template: `--header \"Copyright (c) 2017 Foobar Industries\"`\n\nFor a multiline comment, mark linebreaks with `\\n`: `--header \"First line\\nSecond line\"`\n\nYou can optionally include Swift comment markup in the template if you wish: `--header \"/*--- Header comment ---*/\"`\n\nIf you do not include comment markup, each line in the template will be prepended with `//` and a single space.\n\nIt is common practice to include the file name, creation date and/or the current year in a comment header copyright notice. To do that, you can use the following placeholders:\n\n* `{file}` - the name of the file\n* `{year}` - the current year\n* `{created}` - the date on which the file was created\n* `{created.year}` - the year in which the file was created\n* `{author.name}` - the name of the user who first committed the file\n* `{author.email}` - the email of the user who first committed the file \n\nFor example, a header template of:\n\n```bash\n--header \"{file}\\nCopyright (c) {year} Foobar Industries\\nCreated by John Smith on {created}.\"\n```\n\nWill be formatted as:\n\n```swift\n// SomeFile.swift\n// Copyright (c) 2019 Foobar Industries\n// Created by John Smith on 01/02/2016.\n```\n\n**NOTE:** the `{year}` value and `{created}` date format are determined from the current locale and timezone of the machine running the script. `{author.name}` and `{author.email}` requires the project to be version controlled by git.\n\n\nMarkdown formatting\n-------------------\n\nSwiftFormat can format Swift code blocks inside Markdown files (`.md`). This is useful for keeping code examples in documentation, README files, and other markdown content properly formatted.\n\n````diff\n  ### Sample README\n  \n  This is a nice project with lots of cool APIs to know about, including:\n  \n  ```swift\n  func foo(\n- bar: Bar,\n- baaz: Baaz\n+     bar: Bar,\n+     baaz: Baaz\n  ) -> Foo { ... }\n  ```\n````\n\nTo format Swift code blocks in markdown files, use the `--markdown-files` option with either `strict` or `lenient`:\n\n```bash\n$ swiftformat . --markdown-files strict\n$ swiftformat . --markdown-files lenient\n```\n\nOr add it to your `.swiftformat` config file:\n\n```\n--markdown-files strict\n```\n\n**Formatting modes:**\n\nSwiftFormat supports two modes for handling markdown files:\n\n- `lenient` (default): Ignores parsing errors in code blocks and continues formatting\n- `strict`: Fails if any code blocks contain parsing errors\n\nSwiftFormat's tokenizer is more permissive than the Swift compiler and typically only emits errors when encountering unbalanced scope tokens like `(` or `{`.\n\n**Code block options:**\n\nYou can specify options for options for individual code blocks by adding them after the opening delimiter. For example, you can use `no-format` to prevent a code block from being parsed or formatted:\n\n````md\n```swift no-format\nfunc example()\n{\n    doSomething()\n}\n```\n````\n\nYou can also specify SwiftFormat command line options to configure the behavior of individual rules:\n\n````md\n```swift --indent 2\nfunc example() {\n  doSomething()\n}\n```\n\n```swift --disable redundantSelf\nfunc example() {\n    self.doSomething()\n}\n```\n````\n\nFAQ\n-----\n\n*Q. How is this different from SwiftLint?*\n\n> A. SwiftLint is primarily designed to find and report code smells and style violations in your code. SwiftFormat is designed to fix them. While SwiftLint can autocorrect some issues, and SwiftFormat has some support for [linting](#linting), their primary functions are different.\n\n\n*Q. Can SwiftFormat and SwiftLint be used together?*\n\n> A. Absolutely! The style rules encouraged by both tools are quite similar, and SwiftFormat even fixes some style violations that SwiftLint warns about but can't currently autocorrect.\n\n\n*Q. What platforms does SwiftFormat support?*\n\n> A. SwiftFormat works on macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and above, and also runs on Ubuntu Linux and Windows.\n\n\n*Q. What versions of Swift are supported?*\n\n> A. The SwiftFormat framework and command-line tool can be compiled using Swift 5.3 and above, and can format programs written in Swift 4.x or 5. Swift 3.x is no longer actively supported. If you are still using Swift 3.x or earlier and find that SwiftFormat breaks your code, the best solution is probably to revert to an earlier SwiftFormat release, or enable only a small subset of rules. Use the `--swift-version` argument to enable additional rules specific to later Swift versions.\n\n\n*Q. SwiftFormat made changes I didn't want it to. How can I find out which rules to disable?*\n\n> A. If you run SwiftFormat using the `--verbose` option, it will tell you which rules were applied to each file. You can then selectively disable certain rules using the `--disable` argument (see below).\n\n\n*Q. People on my team have different SwiftFormat versions installed. How can we ensure consistent formatting?\n\n> A. You can specify a `--min-version` argument in your project's .swiftformat` file to fail the build if developers attempt to use an older SwiftFormat version.\n\n\n*Q. How can I modify the formatting rules?*\n\n> A. Many configuration options are exposed in the command-line interface or `.swiftformat` configuration file. You can either set these manually, or use the `--infer-options` argument to automatically generate the configuration from your existing project.\n\n> If there is a rule that you don't like, and which cannot be configured to your liking via the command-line options, you can disable one or more rules by using the `--disable` argument, followed by the name of the rules, separated by commas. You can display a list of all supported rules using the `--rules` argument, and their behaviors are documented above this section in the README.\n\n> If you are using the Xcode source editor extension, rules and options can be configured using the [SwiftFormat for Xcode](#xcode-source-editor-extension) host application. Unfortunately, due to limitation of the Extensions API, there is no way to configure these on a per-project basis.\n\n> If the options you want aren't exposed, and disabling the rule doesn't solve the problem, the rules are implemented in the file `Rules.swift`, so you can modify them and build a new version of the command-line tool. If you think your changes might be generally useful, make a pull request.\n\n\nQ. I don't want to be surprised by new rules added when I upgrade SwiftFormat. How can I prevent this?\n\n> A. You can use the `--rules` argument to specify an exclusive list of rules to run. If new rules are added, they won't be enabled if you have specified a `--rules` list in your SwiftFormat configuration.\n\n\n*Q. Why can't I set the indent width or choose between tabs/spaces in the [SwiftFormat for Xcode](#xcode-source-editor-extension) options?*\n\n> Indent width and tabs/spaces can be configured in Xcode on a per project-basis. You'll find the option under \"Text Settings\" in the Files inspector of the right-hand sidebar.\n\n\n*Q. After applying SwiftFormat, my code won't compile. Is that a bug?*\n\n> A. SwiftFormat should ideally never break your code. Check the [known issues](#known-issues), and if it's not already listed there, or the suggested workaround doesn't solve your problem, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/issues).\n\n\n*Q. Can I use SwiftFormat to lint my code without changing it?*\n\n> A. Yes, see the [linting](#linting) section above for details.\n\n\n*Q. Can I use the `SwiftFormat.framework` inside another app?*\n\n> A. Yes, the SwiftFormat framework can be included in an app or test target, and used for many kinds of parsing and processing of Swift source code besides formatting. The SwiftFormat framework is available as a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SwiftFormat) for easy integration.\n\n*Q. How to create own rule?*\n\n> A. 1) Open `SwiftFormat.xcodeproj`; 2) Add a rule in `Sources/Rules/..`; 3) Add a test in `Tests/Rules/..`; 4) Add an example in `Sources/Examples.swift`; 5) Run all tests.\n\n*Q. How do I run and debug the command line tool in Xcode while developing a new rule?*\n\n> A. You can run the `swiftformat` command line tool via the `Swift Format (Command Line Tool)` scheme, and you can pass in arguments like `/path/to/my/code --config /path/to/my/config` as the `Arguments Passed On Launch` in Xcode's scheme editor. More instructions are available [here](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/pull/1804#issuecomment-2263079432).\n\nKnown issues\n---------------\n\n* When using the Xcode Source Editor Extension, the SwiftFormat menu sometimes disappears from Xcode. If this happens, try moving or renaming Xcode temporarily and then changing it back. Failing that, the suggestions in [this thread](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat/issues/494) may help.\n\n* The `enumNamespaces` rule replaces classes that have only static members with an `enum`. If the class is subclassed, or if there is code that depends on the class exposing certain runtime behaviors, this may break the program. To solve this you can either fix it on a per-case basis by adding a `// swiftformat:disable:next enumNamespaces` comment directive above the class declaration, or you can add `--enum-namespaces structs-only` to prevent the rule being applied to classes, or you can just disable the `enumNamespaces` rule completely.\n\n* The `redundantVoidReturnType` rule can inadvertently alter the type signature for closures, for example in cases where the closure calls a `@discardableResult` function. To solve this you can either fix it on a per-case basis by adding a `// swiftformat:disable:next redundantVoidReturnType` comment directive to disable the rule for a specific call site, or you can add `--closure-void preserve` to your [configuration](#configuration) to disable the rule completely for closures (regular functions or methods aren't affected).\n\n* The `redundantType` rule can introduce ambiguous code in certain cases when using the default mode of `--redundant-type inferred`. This can be worked around by by using `--redundant-type explicit`, or by manually removing the redundant type reference on the affected line, or by using the `// swiftformat:disable:next redundantType` comment directive to disable the rule at the call site (or just disable the `redundantType` rule completely).\n\n* If a type initializer or factory method returns an implicitly unwrapped optional value then the `redundantType` rule may remove the explicit type in a situation where it's actually required. To work around this you can either use `--redundant-type explicit`, or use the `// swiftformat:disable:next redundantType` comment directive to disable the rule at the call site (or just disable the `redundantType` rule completely).\n\n* When using the `initCoderUnavailable` rule, if an `init` that is marked as unavailable is overridden elsewhere in the program then it will cause a compilation error. The recommended workaround is to remove the override (which shouldn't affect the program behavior if the init was really unused) or use the `// swiftformat:disable:next initCoderUnavailable` comment directive to disable the rule for the overridden init (or just disable the `initCoderUnavailable` rule completely).\n\n* When using the `extensionAccessControl` rule with the `--extension-acl on-extension` option, if you have public methods defined on an internal type defined in another file, the resultant public extension will no longer compile. The recommended solution is to manually remove the `public` modifier (this won't change the program behavior) or disable the `extensionAccessControl` rule.\n\n* When using the `preferKeyPath` rule, conversion of `compactMap { $0.foo }` to `compactMap(\\.foo)` or `flatMap { $0.foo }` to `flatMap(\\.foo)` will result in code that fails to compile if `foo` is not an `Optional` property. This is due to a difference in the way that Swift handles type inference for closures vs keyPaths, as discussed [here](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-13347). The recommended workaround is to replace `compactMap()` or `flatMap()` with `map()` in these cases, which will not change the behavior of the code.\n\n* When using the `--self remove` option, the `redundantSelf` rule will remove references to `self` in autoclosure arguments, which may change the meaning of the code, or cause it not to compile. To work around this issue, use the `--self-required` option to provide a comma-delimited list of methods to be excluded from the rule. The `expect()` function from the popular [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) unit testing framework is already excluded by default. If you are using the `--self insert` option then this is not an issue.\n\n* If you assign `SomeClass.self` to a variable and then instantiate an instance of the class using that variable, Swift requires that you use an explicit `.init()`, however, the `redundantInit` rule is not currently capable of detecting this situation in all cases, and may remove the `.init`. To work around this issue, use the `// swiftformat:disable:next redundantInit` comment directive to disable the rule for any affected lines of code (or just disable the `redundantInit` rule completely).\n\n* The `--self insert` option can only recognize locally declared member variables, not ones inherited from superclasses or extensions in other files, so it cannot insert missing `self` references for those. Note that the reverse is not true: `--self remove` should remove *all* redundant `self` references.\n\n* The `trailingClosures` rule can generate ambiguous code if a function has multiple optional closure arguments, or if multiple functions have signatures differing only by the name of the closure argument. For this reason, the rule is limited to anonymous closure arguments by default. You can use the `--trailing-closures` and `--never-trailing` arguments to explicitly opt in or out of trailing closure support for specific functions.\n\n* The `isEmpty` rule will convert `count == 0` to `isEmpty` even for types that do not have an `isEmpty` method, such as `NSArray`/`NSDictionary`/etc. Use of Foundation collections in Swift code is pretty rare, but just in case, the rule is disabled by default.\n\n* The `preferForLoop` rule will convert `foo.forEach` to `for item in foo` even for types that do not conform to the `Sequence` protocol and cannot be used with a `for ... in` loop. There are no such types built in, but custom types may have this issue.\n\n* If a file begins with a comment, the `stripHeaders` rule will remove it if it is followed by a blank line. To avoid this, make sure that the first comment is directly followed by a line of code.\n\n* When running a version of SwiftFormat built using Xcode 10.2 on macOS 10.14.3 or earlier, you may experience a crash with the error \"dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib\". To fix this, you need to install the [Swift 5 Runtime Support for Command Line Tools](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1998). These tools are included by default in macOS 10.14.4 and later.\n\n* If you have a generic typealias that defines a closure (e.g. `typealias ResultCompletion<T> = (Result<T, Error>) -> Void`) and use this closure as an argument in a generic function (e.g. `func handle<T: Decodable>(_ completion: ResultCompletion<T>)`), the `opaqueGenericParameters` rule may update the function definition to use `some` syntax (e.g. `func handle(_ completion: ResultCompletion<some Decodable>)`). `some` syntax is not permitted in closure parameters, so this will no longer compile. Workarounds include spelling out the closure explicitly in the generic function (instead of using a `typealias`) or disabling the `opaqueGenericParameters` rule (e.g. with `// swiftformat:disable:next opaqueGenericParameters`).\n\n* If compiling for macOS with Xcode 14.0 and configuring SwiftFormat with `--swift-version 5.7`, the `genericExtensions` rule may cause a build failure by updating extensions of the format `extension Collection where Element == Foo` to `extension Collection<Foo>`. This fails to compile for macOS in Xcode 14.0, because the macOS SDK in that version of Xcode [does not include](https://forums.swift.org/t/xcode-14-rc-cannot-specialize-protocol-type/60171) the Swift 5.7 standard library. Workarounds include using `--swift-version 5.6` instead, updating to Xcode 14.1+, or disabling the `genericExtensions` rule (e.g. with `// swiftformat:disable:next genericExtensions`).\n\n* The `propertyTypes` rule can cause a build failure in cases where there are multiple static overloads with the same name but different return types. As a workaround you can rename the overloads to no longer conflict, or exclude the property name with `--preserve-symbols propertyName,otherPropertyName,etc`.\n\n* The `propertyTypes` rule can cause a build failure in cases where the property's type is a protocol / existential like `let shapeStyle: ShapeStyle = .myShapeStyle`, and the value used on the right-hand side is defined in an extension like `extension ShapeStyle where Self == MyShapeStyle { static var myShapeStyle: MyShapeStyle { ... } }`. As a workaround you can use the existential `any` syntax (`let shapeStyle: any ShapeStyle = .myShapeStyle`), which the rule will preserve as-is, or exclude the type name and/or property name with `--preserve-symbols ShapeStyle,myShapeStyle,etc`.\n\n* The `propertyTypes` rule can cause a build failure in cases like `let foo = Foo.bar` where the value is a static member that doesn't return the same time. For example, `let foo: Foo = .bar` would be invalid if the `bar` property was defined as `static var bar: Bar`. As a workaround you can write the name of the type explicitly, like `let foo: Bar = Foo.bar`, or exclude the type name and/or property name with `--preserve-symbols Bar,bar,etc`.\n\n\nTip Jar\n-----------\n\nSwiftFormat is not a commercially-funded product, it's a labor of love given freely to the community.

Written in Kotlin from the\nground up.\n\nFirst add the dependency to your project:\n\n```kotlin\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"io.ktor:ktor-server-netty:$ktor_version\")\n}\n```\n\nThen create an `Application` and install some features:\n\n```kotlin\nimport io.ktor.server.netty.*\nimport io.ktor.server.routing.*\nimport io.ktor.server.application.*\nimport io.ktor.http.*\nimport io.ktor.server.response.*\nimport io.ktor.server.engine.*\n\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    embeddedServer(Netty, 8080) {\n        routing {\n            get(\"/\") {\n                call.respondText(\"Hello, world!\", ContentType.Text.Html)\n            }\n        }\n    }.start(wait = true)\n}\n```\n\nYou also can use [Ktor Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-build-plugins) to configure bom, run tasks and deployment:\n```kotlin\nplugins {\n    id(\"io.ktor.plugin\") version \"3.1.1\"\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"io.ktor:ktor-server-netty\")\n}\n```\n\nTo run the created application, execute:\n```shell\n./gradlew run\n```\n\n* Runs embedded web server on `localhost:8080`\n* Installs routing and responds with `Hello, world!` when receiving a GET http request for the root path\n\n## Start using Ktor\n\nBuild your first Kotlin HTTP or RESTful application using Ktor: [start.ktor.io](https://start.ktor.io)\n\n## Principles\n\n#### Unopinionated\n\nKtor Framework doesn't impose a lot of constraints on what technology a project is going to use – logging,\ntemplating, messaging, persistence, serialization, dependency injection, etc.\nSometimes it may be required to implement a simple interface, but usually it is a matter of writing a\ntransforming or intercepting function. Features are installed into the application using a unified *interception*\nmechanism\nwhich allows building arbitrary pipelines.\n\nKtor Applications can be hosted in any servlet container with Servlet 3.0+ API support such as Tomcat, or\nstandalone using Netty or Jetty. Support for other hosts can be added through the unified hosting API.\n\nKtor APIs are mostly functions calls with lambdas. Thanks to Kotlin DSL capabilities, the code looks declarative.\nApplication composition is entirely up to the developer's choice – with functions or classes, using dependency injection\nframework or doing it all manually in the main function.\n\n#### Asynchronous\n\nThe Ktor pipeline machinery and API are utilising Kotlin coroutines to provide easy-to-use asynchronous\nprogramming model without making it too cumbersome. All host implementations are using asynchronous I/O facilities\nto avoid thread blocking.\n\n#### Testable\n\nKtor applications can be hosted in a special test environment, which emulates a web server to some\nextent without actually doing any networking. It provides easy way to test an application without mocking\ntoo much stuff, and still achieve good performance while validating application calls. Running integration tests with a\nreal\nembedded web server are of course possible, too.\n\n## JetBrains Product\n\nKtor is an official [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com) product and is primarily developed by the team at JetBrains, with\ncontributions\nfrom the community.\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease visit [ktor.io](https://ktor.io) for Quick Start and detailed explanations of features, usage and machinery.\n\n* Getting started with [Gradle](https://ktor.io/docs/gradle.html)\n* Getting started with [Maven](https://ktor.io/docs/maven.html)\n* Getting started with [IDEA](https://ktor.io/docs/intellij-idea.html)\n\n## Reporting Issues / Support\n\nPlease use [our issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KTOR) for filing feature requests and bugs.

You\nprovide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what\ngraphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` r\n# The easiest way to get ggplot2 is to install the whole tidyverse:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# Alternatively, install just ggplot2:\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\n# Or the development version from GitHub:\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"tidyverse/ggplot2\")\n```\n\n## Cheatsheet\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/pngs/thumbnails/data-visualization-cheatsheet-thumbs.png\" width=\"630\" height=\"252\" alt=\"ggplot2 cheatsheet\" /></a>\n\n## Usage\n\nIt’s hard to succinctly describe how ggplot2 works because it embodies a\ndeep philosophy of visualisation. However, in most cases you start with\n`ggplot()`, supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with `aes()`). You\nthen add on layers (like `geom_point()` or `geom_histogram()`), scales\n(like `scale_colour_brewer()`), faceting specifications (like\n`facet_wrap()`) and coordinate systems (like `coord_flip()`).\n\n``` r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-example-1.png\" alt=\"Scatterplot of engine displacement versus highway miles per gallon, for 234 cars coloured by 7 'types' of car. The displacement and miles per gallon are inversely correlated.\"  />\n\n## Lifecycle\n\n[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-brightgreen.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html)\n\nggplot2 is now 18 years old and is used by hundreds of thousands of\npeople to make millions of plots. That means, by-and-large, ggplot2\nitself changes relatively little. When we do make changes, they will be\ngenerally to add new functions or arguments rather than changing the\nbehaviour of existing functions, and if we do make changes to existing\nbehaviour we will do them for compelling reasons.\n\nIf you are looking for innovation, look to ggplot2’s rich ecosystem of\nextensions. See a community maintained list at\n<https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/>.\n\n## Learning ggplot2\n\nIf you are new to ggplot2 you are better off starting with a systematic\nintroduction, rather than trying to learn from reading individual\ndocumentation pages. Currently, there are several good places to start:\n\n1.  The [Data Visualization](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize) and\n    [Communication](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/communication) chapters in [R\n    for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz). R for Data Science is\n    designed to give you a comprehensive introduction to the\n    [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/), and these two chapters will get\n    you up to speed with the essentials of ggplot2 as quickly as\n    possible.\n\n2.  If you’d like to take an online course, try [Data Visualization in R\n    With\n    ggplot2](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/data-visualization-in/9781491963661/)\n    by Kara Woo.\n\n3.  If you’d like to follow a webinar, try [Plotting Anything with\n    ggplot2](https://youtu.be/h29g21z0a68) by Thomas Lin Pedersen.\n\n4.  If you want to dive into making common graphics as quickly as\n    possible, I recommend [The R Graphics\n    Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org) by Winston Chang. It provides a\n    set of recipes to solve common graphics problems.\n\n5.  If you’ve mastered the basics and want to learn more, read [ggplot2:\n    Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org). It\n    describes the theoretical underpinnings of ggplot2 and shows you how\n    all the pieces fit together. This book helps you understand the\n    theory that underpins ggplot2, and will help you create new types of\n    graphics specifically tailored to your needs.\n\n6.  For articles about announcements and deep-dives you can visit the\n    [tidyverse blog](https://tidyverse.org/tags/ggplot2/).\n\n## Getting help\n\nThere are two main places to get help with ggplot2:\n\n1.  The [Posit Community](https://forum.posit.co/) (formerly RStudio\n    Community) is a friendly place to ask any questions about ggplot2.\n\n2.  [Stack\n    Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=frequent&pageSize=50)\n    is a great source of answers to common ggplot2 questions. It is also\n    a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible\n    example that illustrates your problem.\n",

On that site you will likewise find documentation for the reference implementation of the higher-level library LAPACK - the **L**inear **A**lgebra **Pack**age that comes included with OpenBLAS. If you are looking for a general primer or refresher on Linear Algebra, the set of six\n20-minute lecture videos by Prof. Gilbert Strang on either MIT OpenCourseWare [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/) or YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61iQEFiWLE21EJCxwmWvvek) may be helpful.\n\n## Binary Packages\n\nWe provide official binary packages for the following platform:\n\n  * Windows x86/x86_64\n  * Windows arm64 (woa)\n\nYou can download them from [file hosting on sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openblas/files/) or from the [Releases section of the GitHub project page](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/releases).\n\nOpenBLAS is also packaged for many package managers - see [the installation section of the docs](http://www.openmathlib.org/OpenBLAS/docs/install/) for details.\n\n## Installation from Source\n\nObtain the source code from https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/. Note that the default branch\nis `develop` (a `master` branch is still present, but far out of date).\n\nBuild-time parameters can be chosen in `Makefile.rule`, see there for a short description of each option.\nMost options can also be given directly on the command line as parameters to your `make` or `cmake` invocation.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nBuilding OpenBLAS requires the following to be installed:\n\n* GNU Make or CMake\n* A C compiler, e.g. GCC or Clang \n* A Fortran compiler (optional, for LAPACK)\n\nIn general, using a recent version of the compiler is strongly recommended.\nIf a Fortran compiler is not available, it is possible to compile an older version of the included LAPACK\nthat has been machine-translated to C.\n\n### Normal compile\n\nSimply invoking `make` (or `gmake` on BSD) will detect the CPU automatically.\nTo set a specific target CPU, use `make TARGET=xxx`, e.g. `make TARGET=NEHALEM`.\nThe full target list is in the file `TargetList.txt`, other build optionss are documented in Makefile.rule and\ncan either be set there (typically by removing the comment character from the respective line), or used on the\n`make` command line. \nNote that when you run `make install` after building, you need to repeat all command line options you provided to `make`\nin the build step, as some settings like the supported maximum number of threads are automatically derived from the\nbuild host by default, which might not be what you want.\nFor building with `cmake`, the usual conventions apply, i.e. create a build directory either underneath the toplevel\nOpenBLAS source directory or separate from it, and invoke `cmake` there with the path to the source tree and any \nbuild options you plan to set.\n\nFor more details, see the [Building from source](http://www.openmathlib.org/OpenBLAS/docs/install/#building-from-source)\nsection in the docs.\n\n### Cross compile\n\nSet `CC` and `FC` to point to the cross toolchains, and if you use `make`, also set `HOSTCC` to your host C compiler.\nThe target must be specified explicitly when cross compiling.\n\nExamples:\n\n* On a Linux system, cross-compiling to an older MIPS64 router board:\n  ```sh\n  make BINARY=64 CC=mipsisa64r6el-linux-gnuabi64-gcc FC=mipsisa64r6el-linux-gnuabi64-gfortran HOSTCC=gcc TARGET=P6600\n  ```\n*  or to a Windows x64 host: \n  ```sh\n  make CC=\"i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -Bstatic\" FC=\"i686-w64-mingw32-gfortran -static-libgfortran\" TARGET=HASWELL BINARY=32 CROSS=1 NUM_THREADS=20 CONSISTENT_FPCSR=1 HOSTCC=gcc\n  ```\n\nYou can find instructions for other cases both in the \"Supported Systems\" section below and in\nthe [Building from source docs](http://www.openmathlib.org/OpenBLAS/docs/install).\nThe `.yml` scripts included with the sources (which contain the\nbuild scripts for the \"continuous integration\" (CI) build tests automatically run on every proposed change to the sources) may also provide additional hints.\n\nWhen compiling for a more modern CPU target of the same architecture, e.g. `TARGET=SKYLAKEX` on a `HASWELL` host, option `CROSS=1` can be used to suppress the automatic invocation of the tests at the end of the build.\n\n### Debug version\n\nA debug version can be built using `make DEBUG=1`.\n\n### Compile with MASS support on Power CPU (optional)\n\nThe [IBM MASS](https://www.ibm.com/support/home/product/W511326D80541V01/other_software/mathematical_acceleration_subsystem) library consists of a set of mathematical functions for C, C++, and Fortran applications that are tuned for optimum performance on POWER architectures.\nOpenBLAS with MASS requires a 64-bit, little-endian OS on POWER.\nThe library can be installed as shown:\n\n* On Ubuntu:\n

sudo yum install libxlmass-devel.8.1.5\n  ```\n\nAfter installing the MASS library, compile OpenBLAS with `USE_MASS=1`.\nFor example, to compile on Power8 with MASS support: `make USE_MASS=1 TARGET=POWER8`.\n\n### Install to a specific directory (optional)\n\nUse `PREFIX=` when invoking `make`, for example\n\n```sh\nmake install PREFIX=your_installation_directory\n```\n(along with all options you added on the `make` command line in the preceding build step)\nThe default installation directory is `/opt/OpenBLAS`.\n\n## Supported CPUs and Operating Systems\n\nPlease read

For cpu generations not included in this list, the corresponding older model is used. If you also specify `DYNAMIC_OLDER=1`, specific support for Penryn, Dunnington, Opteron, Opteron/SSE3, Bobcat, Atom and Nano is added. Finally there is an option `DYNAMIC_LIST` that allows to specify an individual list of targets to include instead of the default.\n\n`DYNAMIC_ARCH` is also supported on **x86**, where it translates to Katmai, Coppermine, Northwood, Prescott, Banias,\nCore2, Penryn, Dunnington, Nehalem, Athlon, Opteron, Opteron_SSE3, Barcelona, Bobcat, Atom and Nano.\n\nOn **ARMV8**, it enables support for CortexA53, CortexA57, CortexA72, CortexA73, Falkor, ThunderX, ThunderX2T99, TSV110 as well as generic ARMV8 cpus. If compiler support for SVE is available at build time, support for NeoverseN2, NeoverseV1 as well as generic ArmV8SVE targets is also enabled.\n\nFor **POWER**, the list encompasses POWER6, POWER8 and POWER9. POWER10 is additionally available if a sufficiently recent compiler is used for the build.\n\non **ZARCH** it comprises Z13 and Z14 as well as generic zarch support.\n\nOn **riscv64**, DYNAMIC_ARCH enables support for riscv64_zvl128b and riscv64_zvl256b in addition to generic riscv64 support.  A compiler that supports RVV 1.0 is required to build OpenBLAS for riscv64 when DYNAMIC_ARCH is enabled.\n\nOn **LoongArch64**, it comprises LA264 and LA464 as well as generic LoongArch64 support.\n\nThe `TARGET` option can - and usually **should** - be used in conjunction with `DYNAMIC_ARCH=1` to specify which cpu model should be assumed for all the common code in the library, usually you will want to set this to the oldest model you expect to encounter.\nFailure to specify this may lead to advanced instructions being used by the compiler, just because the build host happens to support them. This is most likely to happen when aggressive optimization options are in effect, and the resulting library may then crash with an\nillegal instruction error on weaker hardware, before it even reaches the BLAS routines specifically included for that cpu.\n\nPlease note that it is not possible to combine support for different architectures, so no combined 32 and 64 bit or x86_64 and arm64 in the same library.\n\n### Supported OS\n\n- **GNU/Linux**\n- **MinGW or Visual Studio (CMake)/Windows**: Please read <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/How-to-use-OpenBLAS-in-Microsoft-Visual-Studio>.\n- **Darwin/macOS/OSX/iOS**: Experimental. Although GotoBLAS2 already supports Darwin, we are not OSX/iOS experts.\n- **FreeBSD**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **OpenBSD**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **NetBSD**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **DragonFly BSD**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **Android**: Supported by the community. Please read <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/How-to-build-OpenBLAS-for-Android>.\n- **AIX**: Supported on PPC up to POWER10\n- **Haiku**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **SunOS**: Supported by the community. We don't actively test the library on this OS.\n- **Cortex-M**: Supported by the community. Please read <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/How-to-use-OpenBLAS-on-Cortex-M>.\n\n## Usage\n\nStatically link with `libopenblas.a` or dynamically link with `-lopenblas` if OpenBLAS was\ncompiled as a shared library.\n\n### Setting the number of threads using environment variables\n\nEnvironment variables are used to specify a maximum number of threads.\nFor example,\n\n```sh\nexport OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=4\nexport GOTO_NUM_THREADS=4\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=4\n```\n\nThe priorities are `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` > `GOTO_NUM_THREADS` > `OMP_NUM_THREADS`.\n\nIf you compile this library with `USE_OPENMP=1`, you should set the `OMP_NUM_THREADS`\nenvironment variable; OpenBLAS ignores `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` and `GOTO_NUM_THREADS` when\ncompiled with `USE_OPENMP=1`.\n\n### Setting the number of threads at runtime\n\nWe provide the following functions to control the number of threads at runtime:\n\n```c\nvoid goto_set_num_threads(int num_threads);\nvoid openblas_set_num_threads(int num_threads);\n```\nNote that these are only used once at library initialization, and are not available for\nfine-tuning thread numbers in individual BLAS calls. \nIf you compile this library with `USE_OPENMP=1`, you should use the above functions too.\n\n## Reporting bugs\n\nPlease submit an issue in https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/issues.\n\n## Contact\n\n+ Use github discussions: https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/discussions\n* OpenBLAS users mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openblas-users\n* OpenBLAS developers mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openblas-dev\n\n## Change log\n\nPlease see Changelog.txt.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* Please read the [FAQ](http://www.openmathlib.org/OpenBLAS/docs/faq) section of the docs first.\n* Please use GCC version 4.6 and above to compile Sandy Bridge AVX kernels on Linux/MinGW/BSD.\n* Please use Clang version 3.1 and above to compile the library on Sandy Bridge microarchitecture.\n  Clang 3.0 will generate the wrong AVX binary code.\n* Please use GCC version 6 or LLVM version 6 and above to compile Skylake/CooperLake AVX512 kernels\n* Please use LLVM version 18 and above (version 19 and above on Windows) if you plan to use\n  its new flang compiler for Fortran\n* Please use GCC version 11 and above to compile OpenBLAS on the POWER architecture\n* The number of CPUs/cores should be less than or equal to 256. On Linux `x86_64` (`amd64`),\n  there is experimental support for up to 1024 CPUs/cores and 128 numa nodes if you build\n  the library with `BIGNUMA=1`.\n* OpenBLAS does not set processor affinity by default.\n  On Linux, you can enable processor affinity by commenting out the line `NO_AFFINITY=1` in\n  Makefile.rule. However, note that this may cause\n  [a conflict with R parallel](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-hpc/2012-April/001348.html).\n* On Loongson 3A, `make test` may fail with a `pthread_create` error (`EAGAIN`).\n  However, it will be okay when you run the same test case on the shell.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.

repository for OpenTelemetry Collector components that are not suitable for the  [core repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) of the collector. \n\nThe official distributions, core and contrib, are available as part of the [opentelemetry-collector-releases](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases) repository. Some of the components in this repository are part of the \"core\" distribution, such as the Jaeger and Prometheus components, but most of the components here are only available as part of the \"contrib\" distribution. Users of the OpenTelemetry Collector are also encouraged to build their own custom distributions with the [OpenTelemetry Collector Builder](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/cmd/builder), using the components they need from the core repository, the contrib repository, and possibly third-party or internal repositories.\n\nEach component has its own support levels, as defined in the following sections. For each signal that a component supports, there's a stability level, setting the right expectations. It is possible then that a component will be **Stable** for traces but **Alpha** for metrics and **Development** for logs.\n\n## Stability levels\n\nStability level for components in this repository follow the [definitions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#stability-levels) from the OpenTelemetry Collector repository.\n\n## Gated features\n\nSome features are hidden behind feature gates before they are part of the main code path for the component. Note that the feature gates themselves might be at different [lifecycle stages](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/featuregate#feature-lifecycle).\n\n## Support\n\nEach component is supported either by the community of OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers, as defined by the GitHub group [@open-telemetry/collector-contrib-maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/open-telemetry/teams/collector-contrib-maintainer), or by specific vendors. See the individual README files for information about the specific components.\n\nThe OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers may at any time downgrade specific components if they are deemed unmaintained or if they pose a risk to the repository and/or binary distribution.\n\nEven though the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib maintainers are ultimately responsible for the components hosted here, actual support will likely be provided by individual contributors, typically a code owner for the specific component.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Maintainers\n\n- [Alex Boten](https://github.com/codeboten), Honeycomb\n- [Andrzej Stencel](https://github.com/andrzej-stencel), Elastic\n- [Antoine Toulme](https://github.com/atoulme), Splunk\n- [Bogdan Drutu](https://github.com/bogdandrutu), Snowflake\n- [Christos Markou](https://github.com/ChrsMark), Elastic\n- [Dmitrii Anoshin](https://github.com/dmitryax), Splunk\n- [Edmo Vamerlatti Costa](https://github.com/edmocosta), Elastic\n- [Evan Bradley](https://github.com/evan-bradley), Dynatrace\n- [Pablo Baeyens](https://github.com/mx-psi), DataDog\n- [Sean Marciniak](https://github.com/MovieStoreGuy), Splunk\n- [Tyler Helmuth](https://github.com/TylerHelmuth), Honeycomb\n- [Yang Song](https://github.com/songy23), DataDog\n\nFor more information about the maintainer role, see the [community repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#maintainer).\n\n### Approvers\n\n- [Andrew Wilkins](https://github.com/axw), Elastic\n- [Arthur Silva Sens](https://github.com/ArthurSens), Grafana Labs\n- [Braydon Kains](https://github.com/braydonk), Google\n- [Curtis Robert](https://github.com/crobert-1), Splunk\n- [David Ashpole](https://github.com/dashpole), Google\n- [Matt Wear](https://github.com/mwear), Lightstep\n- [Paulo Janotti](https://github.com/pjanotti), Splunk\n- [Sam DeHaan](https://github.com/dehaansa), Grafana Labs\n- [Vihas Makwana](https://github.com/VihasMakwana), Elastic\n- [Ziqi Zhao](https://github.com/fatsheep9146), Alibaba\n\nFor more information about the approver role, see the [community repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#approver).\n\n### Triagers\n\n- [Benedikt Bongartz](https://github.com/frzifus), Red Hat\n- [Bogdan Stancu](https://github.com/bogdan-st), Adobe\n- [Constança Manteigas](https://github.com/constanca-m), Elastic\n- [Douglas Camata](https://github.com/douglascamata), Coralogix\n- [Florian Bacher](https://github.com/bacherfl), Dynatrace\n- [Israel Blancas](https://github.com/iblancasa), Coralogix\n- [James Moessis](https://github.com/jamesmoessis), Atlassian\n- [Jared Tan](https://github.com/JaredTan95), DaoCloud\n- [Murphy Chen](https://github.com/Frapschen), DaoCloud\n- [Ondrej Dubaj](https://github.com/odubajDT), Dynatrace\n- [Paulo Dias](https://github.com/paulojmdias), Five9\n- [Roger Coll](https://github.com/rogercoll), Elastic\n- Actively seeking contributors to triage issues\n\nFor more information about the triager role, see the [community repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#triager).\n\n### Emeritus Maintainers\n\n- [Daniel Jaglowski](https://github.com/djaglowski)\n- [Juraci Paixão Kröhling](https://github.com/jpkrohling)\n- [Tigran Najaryan](https://github.com/tigrannajaryan)\n\nFor more information about the emeritus role, see the [community repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#emeritus-maintainerapprovertriager).\n\n### Emeritus Approvers\n\n- [Anthony Mirabella](https://github.com/Aneurysm9)\n- [Bryan Aguilar](https://github.com/bryan-aguilar)\n- [Przemek Maciolek](https://github.com/pmm-sumo)\n- [Ruslan Kovalov](https://github.com/kovrus)\n\nFor more information about the emeritus role, see the [community repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#emeritus-maintainerapprovertriager).\n\n### Emeritus Triagers\n\n- [Alolita Sharma](https://github.com/alolita)\n- [Gabriel Aszalos](https://github.com/gbbr)\n- [Goutham Veeramachaneni](https://github.com/gouthamve)\n- [Punya Biswal](https://github.com/punya)\n- [Steve Flanders](https://github.com/flands)\n\nFor more information about the emeritus role, see the [community repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#emeritus-maintainerapprovertriager).\n\n### No Over-Representation\n\nA community member cannot be promoted to be a Collector contrib maintainer if, after their promotion, the resulting maintainers group has more than one-fourth (25%) of the members affiliated with the same employer.

      "readme": "# xcodes\n\nThe best command-line tool to install and switch between multiple versions of Xcode.\n\n_If you're looking for an app version of `xcodes`, try [Xcodes.app](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/XcodesApp)._\n\n![CI Status](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/xcodes/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n\n![Header Image](Header.png)\n\n### :tada: Announcment\n\nXcodes is now part of the `XcodesOrg` - [read more here](nextstep.md)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Homebrew (Preferred)\n\n```sh\nbrew install xcodesorg/made/xcodes\n```\n\nThese are Developer ID-signed and notarized release builds and don't require Xcode to already be installed in order to use.\n\n**Other methods:**\n\n<details>\n<summary>Download a release</summary>\n\nDownload the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/xcodes/releases) page. These are Developer ID-signed release builds and don't require Xcode to already be installed in order to use.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using <a href=\"https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint\">Mint</a></summary>\n\n```sh\nmint install XcodesOrg/xcodes\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Build from source</summary>\n\nBuilding from source requires Xcode 12.0 or later, so it's not an option for setting up a computer from scratch.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/XcodesOrg/xcodes\ncd xcodes\nmake install\n# or, if /usr/local/ isn't in your PATH\nPREFIX=/your/install/directory make install\n```\n\nWhile installing, you may get the following output:\n\n```sh\nswift build\nerror: terminated(72): xcrun --sdk macosx --find xctest output:\n```\n\nIf that occurs, it means you need to select a version of Xcode. You can do this with `xcode-select` or by choosing a Command Line Tools option in Xcode's preferences Locations tab.\n</details>\n\n## Usage\n\n### Install Xcode : \n\nInstall a specific version of Xcode using a command like one of these:\n\n```sh\nxcodes install 10.2.1\nxcodes install 11 Beta 7\nxcodes install 11.2 GM seed\nxcodes install 9.0 --path ~/Archive/Xcode_9.xip\nxcodes install --latest-prerelease\nxcodes install --latest --directory \"/Volumes/Bag Of Holding/\"\nxcodes install --latest --experimental-unxip\n```\n\nYou'll then be prompted to enter your Apple ID username and password. You can also provide these with the `XCODES_USERNAME` and `XCODES_PASSWORD` environment variables.\n\nAfter successfully authenticating, xcodes will save your Apple ID password into the keychain and will remember your Apple ID for future use. If you need to use a different Apple ID than the one that's remembered, set the `XCODES_USERNAME` environment variable.\n\nxcodes will download and install the version you asked for so that it's ready to use.\n\n```sh\n(1/6) Downloading Xcode 11.2.0: 100%\n(2/6) Unarchiving Xcode (This can take a while)\n(3/6) Moving Xcode to /Applications/Xcode-11.2.0.app\n(4/6) Moving Xcode archive Xcode-11.2.0.xip to the Trash\n(5/6) Checking security assessment and code signing\n(6/6) Finishing installation\nxcodes requires superuser privileges in order to finish installation.\nmacOS User Password:\n\nXcode 11.2.0 has been installed to /Applications/Xcode-11.2.0.app\n```\n\nIf you have [aria2](https://aria2.github.io) installed (it's available in Homebrew, `brew install aria2`), then xcodes will default to use it for downloads. It uses up to 16 connections to download Xcode 3-5x faster than URLSession.\n\nXcode will be installed to /Applications by default, but you can provide the path to a different directory with the `--directory` option or the `XCODES_DIRECTORY` environment variable. All of the xcodes commands support this option, like `select` and `uninstall`, so you can manage Xcode versions that aren't in /Applications. xcodes supports having all of your Xcode versions installed in _one_ directory, wherever that may be.\n\n### Install Runtimes : \n\nRun this command line to display the available runtimes \n\n```sh\nxcodes runtimes --include-betas\n```\n\nInstall the wanted Runtime (ex. iOS 17.0-beta1)\n\n```sh\nxcodes runtimes install \"iOS 17.0-beta1\"\n```\n\n### `.xcode-version`\n\nWe recommend the creation of a `.xcode-version` file to explicitly declare and store the Xcode version to be used by your CI environment as well as your team.\n\n```txt\n13.4.1\n```\n\nRead [the proposal](/XCODE_VERSION.md) of `.xcode-version`.\n\n### Commands\n\n- `download <version>`: Download a specific version of Xcode\n- `install <version>`: Download and install a specific version of Xcode\n- `installed`: List the versions of Xcode that are installed\n- `list`: List all versions of Xcode that are available to install\n- `select`: Change the selected Xcode\n- `uninstall`: Uninstall a specific version of Xcode\n- `update`: Update the list of available versions of Xcode\n- `version`: Print the version number of xcodes itself\n- `signout`: Clears the stored username and password\n\n### Experimental Unxip - for faster unxipping\n\nThanks to the amazing work by [saagarjhi](https://github.com/saagarjha/unxip) - Xcodes now includes the ability to unxip up to 70% faster on some systems.\n\n```sh\nxcodes install --latest --experimental-unxip\n```\n\n### Shell Completion Scripts\n\nxcodes can generate completion scripts which allow you to press the tab key on your keyboard to autocomplete commands and arguments when typing an xcodes command. The steps to install a completion script depend on the shell that you use. More information about installation instructions for different shells and the underlying implementation is available in the [swift-argument-parser repo](https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser/blob/main/Sources/ArgumentParser/Documentation.docc/Articles/InstallingCompletionScripts.md).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Zsh, with oh-my-zsh:</summary>\n\nRun the following commands:\n\n```sh\nmkdir ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions\nxcodes --generate-completion-script > ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions/_xcodes\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Development\n\nYou'll need Xcode 13 in order to build and run xcodes.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using Xcode</summary>\nEven though xcodes is a command-line app, all of the normal functionality works in Xcode, like building, running, and running tests. You can even type text into Xcode's console when it prompts you for input like your Apple ID or 2FA code.\n\nWhen running xcodes from Xcode, if you want to run a particular command or pass some arguments, you can hold the option key to present a sheet with more options. This means you'd use <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> or hold <kbd>Option</kbd> while clicking the Run button. Here you can add, remove, and toggle arguments that will be passed to xcodes when it's launched.\n\n![Xcode Edit Scheme Screen](XcodeRunSheet.png)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using Swift command line tools</summary>\nYou can also use the Swift command line tools once you have Xcode installed:\n\n- Build: `swift build`\n- Run: `swift run`, or commands like `swift run xcodes list`\n- Run tests: `swift test`\n\n</details>\n\nThere's a Makefile to help build xcodes for distribution. We already do this for you in order to provide Developer ID-signed and notarized release builds via Homebrew (see [Installation](#installation)).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Releasing a new version of xcodes</summary>\n\n```sh\n# Bump the version number in Version.swift, commit the change, and tag it\nvim Sources/XcodesKit/Version.swift\ngit add Sources/XcodesKit/Version.swift\ngit commit -m \"Bump version to $VERSION\"\ngit tag -asm \"$VERSION\" \"$VERSION\"\n\n# Clean first\nmake clean\n\n# Make a release build of xcodes, sign it, and zip it\nmake zip\n# Create a Homebrew bottle\nmake bottle VERSION=\"$VERSION\"\n\n# Notarize the release build\n# This can take a while\nmake notarize \\\n    TEAMID=\"ABC123\"\n\n# Push the new version bump commit and tag\ngit push --follow-tags\n\n# Edit the draft release created by Release Drafter to point at the new tag\n# Set the release title to the new version\n# Duplicate xcodes-$VERSION.mojave.tar.gz and rename to xcodes-$VERSION.arm64_mojave.tar.gz, also create `xcodes-$VERSION.macos.i386.tar.gz` and `xcodes-$VERSION.macos.arm64.tar.gz`\n# Add the xcodes.zip, xcodes-$VERSION.mojave.tar.gz, xcodes-$VERSION.arm64_mojave.tar.gz files to the release\n# Publish the release\n\n# Update the Homebrew Bottle: https://github.com/XcodesOrg/homebrew-made/blob/master/Formula/xcodes.rb\n```\n\n</details>\n\nNotable design decisions are recorded in [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md). The Apple authentication flow is described in [Apple.paw](./Apple.paw), which will allow you to play with the API endpoints that are involved using the [Paw](https://paw.cloud) app.\n\n[`xcode-install`](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcode-install) and [fastlane/spaceship](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/spaceship) both deserve credit for figuring out the hard parts of what makes this possible.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n[Matt Kiazyk](https://github.com/mattkiazyk) - [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mattkiazyk)\n",

It provides you a chance to use a pure-Swift way to work with remote images in your next app.\n\n## Features\n\n- [x] Asynchronous image downloading and caching.\n- [x] Loading image from either `URLSession`-based networking or local provided data.\n- [x] Useful image processors and filters provided.\n- [x] Multiple-layer hybrid cache for both memory and disk.\n- [x] Fine control on cache behavior. Customizable expiration date and size limit.\n- [x] Cancelable downloading and auto-reusing previous downloaded content to improve performance.\n- [x] Independent components. Use the downloader, caching system, and image processors separately as you need.\n- [x] Prefetching images and showing them from the cache to boost your app.\n- [x] Extensions for `UIImageView`, `NSImageView`, `NSButton`, `UIButton`, `NSTextAttachment`, `WKInterfaceImage`, `TVMonogramView` and `CPListItem` to directly set an image from a URL.\n- [x] Built-in transition animation when setting images.\n- [x] Customizable placeholder and indicator while loading images.\n- [x] Extensible image processing and image format easily.\n- [x] Low Data Mode support.\n- [x] SwiftUI support.\n- [x] Swift 6 & Swift Concurrency (strict mode) prepared.\n- [x] Load & cache for Live Photo.\n\n### Kingfisher 101\n\nThe simplest use-case is setting an image to an image view with the `UIImageView` extension:\n\n```swift\nimport Kingfisher\n\nlet url = URL(string: \"https://example.com/image.png\")\nimageView.kf.setImage(with: url)\n```\n\nKingfisher will download the image from `url`, send it to both memory cache and disk cache, and display it in `imageView`. \nWhen you set it with the same URL later, the image will be retrieved from the cache and shown immediately.\n\nIt also works if you use SwiftUI:\n\n```swift\nvar body: some View {\n    KFImage(URL(string: \"https://example.com/image.png\")!)\n}\n```\n\n### A More Advanced Example\n\nWith the powerful options, you can do hard tasks with Kingfisher in a simple way. For example, the code below: \n\n1. Downloads a high-resolution image.\n2. Downsamples it to match the image view size.\n3. Makes it round cornered with a given radius.\n4. Shows a system indicator and a placeholder image while downloading.\n5. When prepared, it animates the small thumbnail image with a \"fade in\" effect. \n6. The original large image is also cached to disk for later use, to get rid of downloading it again in a detail view.\n7. A console log is printed when the task finishes, either for success or failure.\n\n```swift\nlet url = URL(string: \"https://example.com/high_resolution_image.png\")\nlet processor = DownsamplingImageProcessor(size: imageView.bounds.size)\n             |> RoundCornerImageProcessor(cornerRadius: 20)\nimageView.kf.indicatorType = .activity\nimageView.kf.setImage(\n    with: url,\n    placeholder: UIImage(named: \"placeholderImage\"),\n    options: [\n        .processor(processor),\n        .scaleFactor(UIScreen.main.scale),\n        .transition(.fade(1)),\n        .cacheOriginalImage\n    ])\n{\n    result in\n    switch result {\n    case .success(let value):\n        print(\"Task done for: \\(value.source.url?.absoluteString ?? \"\")\")\n    case .failure(let error):\n        print(\"Job failed: \\(error.localizedDescription)\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt is a common situation I can meet in my daily work. Think about how many lines you need to write without\nKingfisher!\n\n### Method Chaining\n\nIf you are not a fan of the `kf` extension, you can also prefer to use the `KF` builder and chained the method \ninvocations. The code below is doing the same thing:\n\n```swift\n// Use `kf` extension\nimageView.kf.setImage(\n    with: url,\n    placeholder: placeholderImage,\n    options: [\n        .processor(processor),\n        .loadDiskFileSynchronously,\n        .cacheOriginalImage,\n        .transition(.fade(0.25)),\n        .lowDataMode(.network(lowResolutionURL))\n    ],\n    progressBlock: { receivedSize, totalSize in\n        // Progress updated\n    },\n    completionHandler: { result in\n        // Done\n    }\n)\n\n// Use `KF` builder\nKF.url(url)\n  .placeholder(placeholderImage)\n  .setProcessor(processor)\n  .loadDiskFileSynchronously()\n  .cacheMemoryOnly()\n  .fade(duration: 0.25)\n  .lowDataModeSource(.network(lowResolutionURL))\n  .onProgress { receivedSize, totalSize in  }\n  .onSuccess { result in  }\n  .onFailure { error in }\n  .set(to: imageView)\n```\n\nAnd even better, if later you want to switch to SwiftUI, just change the `KF` above to `KFImage`, and you've done:\n\n```swift\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        KFImage.url(url)\n          .placeholder(placeholderImage)\n          .setProcessor(processor)\n          .loadDiskFileSynchronously()\n          .cacheMemoryOnly()\n          .fade(duration: 0.25)\n          .lowDataModeSource(.network(lowResolutionURL))\n          .onProgress { receivedSize, totalSize in  }\n          .onSuccess { result in  }\n          .onFailure { error in }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Kingfisher 8.0\n\n- (UIKit/AppKit) iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+ / tvOS 13.0+ / watchOS 6.0+ / visionOS 1.0+\n- (SwiftUI) iOS 14.0+ / macOS 11.0+ / tvOS 14.0+ / watchOS 7.0+ / visionOS 1.0+\n- Swift 5.9+\n\n### Kingfisher 7.0\n\n- (UIKit/AppKit) iOS 12.0+ / macOS 10.14+ / tvOS 12.0+ / watchOS 5.0+ / visionOS 1.0+\n- (SwiftUI) iOS 14.0+ / macOS 11.0+ / tvOS 14.0+ / watchOS 7.0+ / visionOS 1.0+\n- Swift 5.0+\n\n### Installation\n\nRefer to one of the following tutorials to install and use the framework:\n\n- [UIKit Tutorial](https://swiftpackageindex.com/onevcat/kingfisher/master/tutorials/kingfisher/gettingstarteduikit)\n- [SwiftUI Tutorial](https://swiftpackageindex.com/onevcat/kingfisher/master/tutorials/kingfisher/gettingstartedswiftui)\n\nAlternatively, you can follow either of the methods below.\n\n#### Swift Package Manager\n\n- File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency\n- Add `https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher.git`\n- Select \"Up to Next Major\" with \"8.0.0\"\n\n#### CocoaPods\n\n```ruby\nsource 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'\nplatform :ios, '13.0'\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\n  pod 'Kingfisher', '~> 8.0'\nend\n```\n\n#### Pre-built Framework\n\n1.

However, before you plan to implement some features or try to fix an uncertain issue, it is recommended to open a discussion first. It would be appreciated if your pull requests could build with all tests green. :)\n\n### About the logo\n\nThe logo of Kingfisher is inspired by [Tangram (七巧板)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram), a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat shapes from China. I believe she's a kingfisher bird instead of a swift, but someone insists that she is a pigeon. I guess I should give her a name. Hi, guys, do you have any suggestions?\n\n### Contact\n\nFollow and contact me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/onevcat) or [Sina Weibo](http://weibo.com/onevcat).

Sui demonstrates capacity beyond the transaction processing capabilities of established systems – traditional and blockchain alike. Sui is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform, a foundational layer for web3.\n\n## Sui Architecture\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    CC(CLI Client) --> ClientService\n    RC(Rest Client) --> ClientService\n    RPCC(RPC Client) --> ClientService\n    ClientService --> AuthorityAggregator\n    AuthorityAggregator --> AC1[AuthorityClient] & AC2[AuthorityClient]\n    subgraph Authority1\n      AS[AuthorityState]\n    end\n    subgraph Authority2\n      AS2[AuthorityState]\n    end\n    AC1 <==>|Network TCP| Authority1\n    AC2 <==>|Network TCP| Authority2\n```\n\n## Sui Overview\n\nSui is a smart contract platform maintained by a permissionless set of authorities that play a role similar to validators or miners in other blockchain systems.\n\nSui offers scalability and unprecedented low-latency for common use cases. Sui makes the vast majority of transactions processable in parallel, which makes better use of processing resources, and offers the option to increase throughput with more resources. Sui forgoes consensus to instead use simpler and lower-latency primitives for common use cases, such as payment transactions and asset transfers. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and enables a number of new latency-sensitive distributed applications, ranging from gaming to retail payment at physical points of sale.\n\nSui is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and supports smart contracts written in the [Move programming language](https://github.com/move-language/move) to define assets that may have an owner. Move programs define operations on these assets including custom rules for their creation, the transfer of these assets to new owners, and operations that mutate assets.\n\nSui has a native token called SUI, with a fixed supply. The SUI token is used to pay for gas, and is also used as [delegated stake on authorities](https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos/) within an epoch. The voting power of authorities within this epoch is a function of this delegated stake. Authorities are periodically reconfigured according to the stake delegated to them. In any epoch, the set of authorities is [Byzantine fault tolerant](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf). At the end of the epoch, fees collected through all transactions processed are distributed to authorities according to their contribution to the operation of the system. Authorities can in turn share some of the fees as rewards to users that delegated stakes to them.\n\nSui is supported by several cutting-edge [peer-reviewed studies](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/docs/content/concepts/research-papers.mdx) and extensive years of open-source development.\n\n## More About Sui\n\nUse the following links to learn more about Sui and the Sui ecosystem:\n\n * Learn more about working with Sui in the [Sui Documentation](https://docs.sui.io/).\n * Join the Sui community on [Sui Discord](https://discord.gg/sui).\n * Find out more about the Sui ecosystem on the [Sui Resources](https://sui.io/resources/) page.\n * Review information about Sui governance, [decentralization](https://suifoundation.org/decentralization), and [Developer Grants Program](https://sui.io/grants-hub) on the [Sui Foundation](https://sui.io/about) site.\n\n\n ## How to Contribute\n\n See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute to Sui.\n\n ## Code of Conduct\n\n See the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD) for details on our code of conduct.\n\n ## License\n\n See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.\n",

      "readme": "# Swift Package Manager Project\n\nThe Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing distribution of source code, aimed at making it easy to share your code and reuse others’ code. The tool directly addresses the challenges of compiling and linking Swift packages, managing dependencies, versioning, and supporting flexible distribution and collaboration models.\n\nWe’ve designed the system to make it easy to share packages on services like GitHub, but packages are also great for private personal development, sharing code within a team, or at any other granularity.\n\nSwift Package Manager includes a build system that can build for macOS and Linux. Starting with Xcode 11, Xcode integrates with SwiftPM to provide support for including packages in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications.\n\nThe [SourceKit-LSP](https://github.com/swiftlang/sourcekit-lsp) project leverages libSwiftPM and provides [Language Server Protocol](https://langserver.org/) implementation for editors that support LSP.\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n* [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n* [Documentation](#documentation)\n* [System Requirements](#system-requirements)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [Reporting issues](#reporting-issues)\n* [License](#license)\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPlease use [this guide](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) for learning package manager basics.\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor Quick Help use the `swift package --help` command.\n\nFor documentation on using Swift Package Manager, creating packages, and more, see the [Package Manager Docs](https://docs.swift.org/swiftpm/documentation/packagemanagerdocs).\n\nFor documentation on developing the Swift Package Manager itself, see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFor detailed documentation on the package manifest API, see [PackageDescription API](https://docs.swift.org/swiftpm/documentation/packagedescription).\n\nFor release notes with information about changes between versions, see the [release notes](Documentation/ReleaseNotes).\n\n---\n\n## System Requirements\n\nThe package manager’s system requirements are the same as [those for Swift](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/blob/main/docs/HowToGuides/GettingStarted.md#system-requirements) with the caveat that the package manager requires Git at runtime as well as build-time.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nThe package manager is available as part the Swift toolchains available on [Swift.org](https://swift.org/download/)) including snapshots for the latest versions built from `main` branch. For installation instructions for downloaded snapshots, please see the [Getting Started](https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift) section of [Swift.org](https://swift.org).\n\nThe Swift Package Manager is also included in Xcode 8.0 and all subsequent releases.\n\nYou can verify your installation by typing `swift package --version` in a terminal:\n\n```sh\n$ swift package --version\nApple Swift Package Manager - ...\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are several ways to contribute to Swift Package Manager. To learn about the policies, best practices that govern contributions to the Swift project and instructions for setting up the development environment please read the [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).  \n\nThe Swift package manager uses [llbuild](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild) as the underlying build system for compiling source files. It is also open source and part of the Swift project.\n\n---\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nIf you have any trouble with the package manager, help is available. We recommend:\n\n* The [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/development/swiftpm/),\n* SwiftPM's [bug tracker](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/issues)\n\nWhen reporting an issue please follow the bug reporting guidelines, they can be found in [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues).\n\nIf you’re not comfortable sharing your question with the list, contact details for the code owners can be found in [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS); however, Swift Forums is usually the best place to go for help.\n\n---\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2015 - 2025 Apple Inc. and the Swift project authors.

Where\navailable, it's recommended to install any libraries with a `Swift` suffix to get the\nbest experience when writing your app in Swift.\n\n1. [Standard pod install](#standard-pod-install)\n2. [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)\n3. [Installing from the GitHub repo](#installing-from-github)\n4. [Experimental Carthage](#carthage-ios-only)\n\n### Standard pod install\n\nFor instructions on the standard pod install, visit:\n[https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nInstructions for [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) support can be\nfound in the [SwiftPackageManager.md](SwiftPackageManager.md) Markdown file.\n\n### Installing from GitHub\n\nThese instructions can be used to access the Firebase repo at other branches,\ntags, or commits.\n\n#### Background\n\nSee [the Podfile Syntax Reference](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#pod)\nfor instructions and options about overriding pod source locations.\n\n#### Accessing Firebase Source Snapshots\n\nAll official releases are tagged in this repo and available via CocoaPods. To access a local\nsource snapshot or unreleased branch, use Podfile directives like the following:\n\nTo access FirebaseFirestore via a branch:\n```ruby\npod 'FirebaseCore', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :branch => 'main'\npod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git', :branch => 'main'\n```\n\nTo access FirebaseMessaging via a checked-out version of the firebase-ios-sdk repo:\n```ruby\npod 'FirebaseCore', :path => '/path/to/firebase-ios-sdk'\npod 'FirebaseMessaging', :path => '/path/to/firebase-ios-sdk'\n```\n\n### Carthage (iOS only)\n\nInstructions for the experimental Carthage distribution can be found at\n[Carthage.md](Carthage.md).\n\n### Using Firebase from a Framework or a library\n\nFor details on using Firebase from a Framework or a library, refer to [firebase_in_libraries.md](docs/firebase_in_libraries.md).\n\n## Development\n\nTo develop Firebase software in this repository, ensure that you have at least\nthe following software:\n\n* Xcode 16.2 (or later)\n\nCocoaPods is still the canonical way to develop, but much of the repo now supports\ndevelopment with Swift Package Manager.\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nInstall the following:\n* CocoaPods 1.12.0 (or later)\n* [CocoaPods generate](https://github.com/square/cocoapods-generate)\n\nFor the pod that you want to develop:\n\n```ruby\npod gen Firebase{name here}.podspec --local-sources=./ --auto-open --platforms=ios\n```\n\nNote: If the CocoaPods cache is out of date, you may need to run\n`pod repo update` before the `pod gen` command.\n\nNote: Set the `--platforms` option to `macos` or `tvos` to develop/test for\nthose platforms. Since 10.2, Xcode does not properly handle multi-platform\nCocoaPods workspaces.\n\nFirestore has a self-contained Xcode project. See\n[Firestore/README](Firestore/README.md) Markdown file.\n\n#### Development for Catalyst\n* `pod gen {name here}.podspec --local-sources=./ --auto-open --platforms=ios`\n* Check the Mac box in the App-iOS Build Settings\n* Sign the App in the Settings Signing & Capabilities tab\n* Click Pods in the Project Manager\n* Add Signing to the iOS host app and unit test targets\n* Select the Unit-unit scheme\n* Run it to build and test\n\nAlternatively, disable signing in each target:\n* Go to Build Settings tab\n* Click `+`\n* Select `Add User-Defined Setting`\n* Add `CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED` setting with a value of `NO`\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n* To enable test schemes: `./scripts/setup_spm_tests.sh`\n* `open Package.swift` or double click `Package.swift` in Finder.\n* Xcode will open the project\n  * Choose a scheme for a library to build or test suite to run\n  * Choose a target platform by selecting the run destination along with the scheme\n\n### Adding a New Firebase Pod\n\nRefer to [AddNewPod](docs/AddNewPod.md) Markdown file for details.\n\n### Managing Headers and Imports\n\nFor information about managing headers and imports, see [HeadersImports](HeadersImports.md) Markdown file.\n\n### Code Formatting\n\nTo ensure that the code is formatted consistently, run the script\n[./scripts/check.sh](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/blob/main/scripts/check.sh)\nbefore creating a pull request (PR).\n\nGitHub Actions will verify that any code changes are done in a style-compliant\nway. Install `clang-format` and `mint`:\n\n```console\nbrew install clang-format@21\nbrew install mint\n```\n\n### Running Unit Tests\n\nSelect a scheme and press Command-u to build a component and run its unit tests.\n\n### Running Sample Apps\nTo run the sample apps and integration tests, you'll need a valid\n`GoogleService-Info.plist\n` file. The Firebase Xcode project contains dummy plist\nfiles without real values, but they can be replaced with real plist files. To get your own\n`GoogleService-Info.plist` files:\n\n1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)\n2. Create a new Firebase project, if you don't already have one\n3. For each sample app you want to test, create a new Firebase app with the sample app's bundle\nidentifier (e.g., `com.google.Database-Example`)\n4. Download the resulting `GoogleService-Info.plist` and add it to the Xcode project.\n\n### Coverage Report Generation\n\nFor coverage report generation instructions, see [scripts/code_coverage_report/README](scripts/code_coverage_report/README.md) Markdown file.\n\n## Specific Component Instructions\nSee the sections below for any special instructions for those components.\n\n### Firebase AI Logic\n\nSee the [Firebase AI Logic README](FirebaseAI#development) for instructions\nabout building and testing the SDK.\n\n### Firebase Auth\n\nFor specific Firebase Auth development, refer to the [Auth Sample README](FirebaseAuth/Tests/Sample/README.md) for instructions about\nbuilding and running the FirebaseAuth pod along with various samples and tests.\n\n### Firebase Database\n\nThe Firebase Database Integration tests can be run against a locally running Database Emulator\nor against a production instance.\n\nTo run against a local emulator instance, invoke `./scripts/run_database_emulator.sh start` before\nrunning the integration test.\n\nTo run against a production instance, provide a valid `GoogleServices-Info.plist` and copy it to\n`FirebaseDatabase/Tests/Resources/GoogleService-Info.plist`. Your Security Rule must be set to\n[public](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/quickstart) while your tests are\nrunning.\n\n### Firebase Dynamic Links\n\nFirebase Dynamic Links is **deprecated** and should not be used in new projects. The service will shut down on August 25, 2025.\n\nPlease see our [Dynamic Links Deprecation FAQ documentation](https://firebase.google.com/support/dynamic-links-faq) for more guidance.\n\n### Firebase Performance Monitoring\n\nFor specific Firebase Performance Monitoring development, see\n[the Performance README](FirebasePerformance/README.md) for instructions about building the SDK\nand [the Performance TestApp README](FirebasePerformance/Tests/TestApp/README.md) for instructions about\nintegrating Performance with the dev test App.\n\n### Firebase Storage\n\nTo run the Storage Integration tests, follow the instructions in\n[StorageIntegration.swift](FirebaseStorage/Tests/Integration/StorageIntegration.swift).\n\n#### Push Notifications\n\nPush notifications can only be delivered to specially provisioned App IDs in the developer portal.\nIn order to test receiving push notifications, you will need to:\n\n1. Change the bundle identifier of the sample app to something you own in your Apple Developer\naccount and enable that App ID for push notifications.\n2. You'll also need to\n[upload your APNs Provider Authentication Key or certificate to the\nFirebase Console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs)\nat **Project Settings > Cloud Messaging > [Your Firebase App]**.\n3. Ensure your iOS device is added to your Apple Developer portal as a test device.\n\n#### iOS Simulator\n\nThe iOS Simulator cannot register for remote notifications and will not receive push notifications.\nTo receive push notifications, follow the steps above and run the app on a physical device.\n\n## Building with Firebase on Apple platforms\n\nFirebase provides official beta support for macOS, Catalyst, and tvOS. visionOS and watchOS\nare community supported. Thanks to community contributions for many of the multi-platform PRs.\n\nAt this time, most of Firebase's products are available across Apple platforms. There are still\na few gaps, especially on visionOS and watchOS. For details about the current support matrix, see\n[this chart](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/learn-more#firebase_library_support_by_platform)\nin Firebase's documentation.\n\n### visionOS\n\nWhere supported, visionOS works as expected with the exception of Firestore via Swift Package\nManager where it is required to use the source distribution.\n\nTo enable the Firestore source distribution, quit Xcode and open the desired\nproject from the command line with the `FIREBASE_SOURCE_FIRESTORE` environment\nvariable: `open --env FIREBASE_SOURCE_FIRESTORE /path/to/project.xcodeproj`.\nTo go back to using the binary distribution of Firestore, quit Xcode and open\nXcode like normal, without the environment variable.\n\n### watchOS\nThanks to contributions from the community, many of Firebase SDKs now compile, run unit tests, and\nwork on watchOS. See the [Independent Watch App Sample](Example/watchOSSample).\n\nKeep in mind that watchOS is not officially supported by Firebase. While we can catch basic unit\ntest issues with GitHub Actions, there may be some changes where the SDK no longer works as expected\non watchOS. If you encounter this, please\n[file an issue](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk/issues).\n\nDuring app setup in the console, you may get to a step that mentions something like \"Checking if the\napp has communicated with our servers\". This relies on Analytics and will not work on watchOS.\n**It's safe to ignore the message and continue**, the rest of the SDKs will work as expected.\n\n#### Additional Crashlytics Notes\n* watchOS has limited support. Due to watchOS restrictions, mach exceptions and signal crashes are\nnot recorded.

      "readme": "# Redot Engine LTS\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://redotengine.org/\">\n    <img src=\"logo_outlined.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Redot Engine logo\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine\n\n**[Redot Engine LTS](https://redotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform\ngame engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a\ncomprehensive set of common tools, so that\nusers can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can\nbe exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop\nplatforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as\nWeb-based platforms and consoles.\n\n## Free, open source and community-driven\n\nRedot is a completely free and open source fork of Godot under the very permissive MIT license.\nNo strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down\nto the last line of engine code. Redot's development is fully independent and truly\ncommunity-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their\nexpectations.\n\nBefore being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),\nGodot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and\n[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining Godot)\nfor several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire\ntitles.\n\nRedot was forked from Godot in [September 2024](https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine/commit/a12e9de5dd831e1ce0c839f0420b278ef0a6aa5b),\nintending to improve upon Godot in order to fulfill its potential and contribute to the shared\ncodebase of both through a more genuinely community-driven model than Godot.\n\n[Kaetram - 2D Pixel Cross-Platform MMORPG by Keros](https://kaetram.com)\n<p align=\"center\">\n\t<img src=\"screenshot.jpg\" width=\"900\" alt=\"Redot Engine screenshot!\">\n</p>\n\n## Getting the engine\n\n### Binary downloads\n\nOfficial binaries for the Redot editor and the export templates will be found\n[on the Redot website](https://redotengine.org/download) once it's set up and on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Redot-Engine/redot-engine) until then.\n\n### Compiling from source\n\n#### Using Nix (recommended)\n\nIf you have the Nix package manager installed, you can build and run the editor in one command:\n\n```bash\nnix run .\n```\n\nThis will automatically install all build dependencies and compile Redot if the binary doesn't exist.\n\nFor manual control over the build process:\n\n```bash\n# Enter the Nix development environment\nnix develop\n\n# Build Redot (use 'macos' on macOS, 'linuxbsd' on Linux)\nscons platform=linuxbsd  # or: scons platform=macos\n\n# Run the editor - binary name reflects your platform and architecture\n# Examples: redot.linuxbsd.editor.x86_64, redot.macos.editor.arm64\n./bin/redot.<platform>.editor.<arch>\n```\n\nNix works on Linux and macOS, and is available at [nixos.org/download.html](https://nixos.org/download.html). The `nix run .` command automatically detects your platform and architecture.\n\n\n## Community and contributing\n\nRedot is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine\ndevelopers. Please visit our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/redot)!\n\nTo get started contributing to the project, see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\nThis document also includes guidelines for reporting bugs.\n\nFollow [Redot on X/Twitter](https://x.com/Redot_Engine)!\n## Documentation and demos\n\nThe class reference is accessible from the Redot editor.\n\n## ReX Engine\n\nLooking to try out new features that aren't backwards compatible with Godot, or would you like to create new features for Redot Engine that can't be added here due to compatibility issues?\n\nMeet us over at the [ReX Engine Repo](https://github.com/redot-rex/rex-engine) Where we aim to create a modern engine using Redot Engine as a starting point, free from godots choices and shortcomings, and innovate in ways not currently possible here within Redot Engine.\n",

      "readme": "# Stripe iOS SDK\n\n[![CocoaPods](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/Stripe.svg?style=flat)](http://cocoapods.org/?q=author%3Astripe%20name%3Astripe)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/l/Stripe.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/blob/master/LICENSE)\n[![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/Stripe.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios#)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Want to chat live with Stripe engineers? Join us on our [Discord server](https://stripe.com/go/developer-chat).\n\nThe Stripe iOS SDK makes it quick and easy to build an excellent payment experience in your iOS app. We provide powerful and customizable UI screens and elements that can be used out-of-the-box to collect your users' payment details. We also expose the low-level APIs that power those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.\n\nGet started with our [📚 integration guides](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios) and [example projects](#Examples), or [📘 browse the SDK reference](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/docs/index.html).\n\n> Updating to a newer version of the SDK? See our [migration guide](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/blob/master/MIGRATING.md) and [changelog](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\nTable of contents\n=================\n<!-- NOTE: Use case-sensitive anchor links for docc compatibility -->\n<!--ts-->\n   * [Features](#Features)\n   * [Releases](#Releases)\n   * [Requirements](#Requirements)\n   * [Getting started](#Getting-started)\n      * [Integration](#Integration)\n      * [Examples](#Examples)\n      * [Building from source](#Building-from-source)\n   * [Card scanning](#Card-scanning)\n   * [Contributing](#Contributing)\n   * [Migrating](#Migrating-from-older-versions)\n   * [Code Style](#Code-style)\n   * [Licenses](#Licenses)\n\n<!--te-->\n\n## Features\n\n**Simplified security**: We make it simple for you to collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers and remain [PCI compliant](https://stripe.com/docs/security#pci-dss-guidelines). This means the sensitive data is sent directly to Stripe instead of passing through your server. For more information, see our [integration security guide](https://stripe.com/docs/security).\n\n**Apple Pay**: [StripeApplePay](StripeApplePay/README.md) provides a [seamless integration with Apple Pay](https://stripe.com/docs/apple-pay).\n\n**SCA-ready**: The SDK automatically performs native [3D Secure authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure) if needed to comply with [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) regulation in Europe.\n\n**Native UI**: We provide native screens and elements to collect payment details. For example, [PaymentSheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios) is a prebuilt UI that combines all the steps required to pay - collecting payment details, billing details, and confirming the payment - into a single sheet that displays on top of your app.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89988962/153276097-9b3369a0-e732-45c4-96ec-ff9d48ad0fb6.png\" alt=\"PaymentSheet\" align=\"center\"/>\n\n**Stripe API**: [StripePayments](StripePayments/README.md) provides [low-level APIs](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/docs/Classes/STPAPIClient.html) that correspond to objects and methods in the Stripe API. You can build your own entirely custom UI on top of this layer, while still taking advantage of utilities like [STPCardValidator](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/docs/Classes/STPCardValidator.html) to validate your user’s input.\n\n**Card scanning**: We support card scanning on iOS 13 and higher. See our [Card scanning](#Card-scanning) section.\n\n**App Clips**: The `StripeApplePay` module provides a [lightweight SDK for offering Apple Pay in an App Clip](https://stripe.com/docs/apple-pay#app-clips).\n\n**Localized**: We support the following localizations: Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (US), English (United Kingdom), Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, French (Canada), German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Maltese, Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Spanish (Latin America), Swedish, Turkish, Thai and Vietnamese.\n\n**Identity**: Learn about our [Stripe Identity iOS SDK](StripeIdentity/README.md) to verify the identity of your users.\n\n#### Recommended usage\n\nIf you're selling digital products or services that will be consumed within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use Apple's in-app purchase APIs. See the [App Store review guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) for more information. For all other scenarios you can use this SDK to process payments via Stripe.\n\n#### Privacy\n\nThe Stripe iOS SDK collects data to help us improve our products and prevent fraud. This data is never used for advertising and is not rented, sold, or given to advertisers. Our full privacy policy is available at [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n\nFor help with Apple's App Privacy Details form in App Store Connect, visit [Stripe iOS SDK Privacy

|\n\n## Releases\n\nWe support Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.\n\nIf you link the library manually, use a version from our [releases](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/releases) page and make sure to embed <ins>all</ins> of the required frameworks.\n\nFor the `Stripe` module, link the following frameworks:\n- `Stripe.xcframework`\n- `Stripe3DS2.xcframework`\n- `StripeApplePay.xcframework`\n- `StripePayments.xcframework`\n- `StripePaymentsUI.xcframework`\n- `StripeCore.xcframework`\n- `StripeUICore.xcframework`\n\nFor other modules, follow the instructions below:\n- [StripeApplePay](StripeApplePay/README.md#manual-linking)\n- [StripeConnect](StripeConnect/README.md#manual-linking)\n- [StripeFinancialConnections](StripeFinancialConnections/README.md#manual-linking)\n- [StripeIdentity](StripeIdentity/README.md#manual-linking)\n- [StripePaymentSheet](StripePaymentSheet/README.md#manual-linking)\n- [StripePayments](StripePayments/README.md#manual-linking)\n- [StripePaymentsUI](StripePaymentsUI/README.md#manual-linking)\n\nIf you're reading this on GitHub.com, please make sure you are looking at the [tagged version](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tags) that corresponds to the release you have installed. Otherwise, the instructions and example code may be mismatched with your copy.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe Stripe iOS SDK requires Xcode 16 or later and is compatible with apps targeting iOS 13 or above. We support Catalyst on macOS 11 or later.\n\nFor iOS 12 support, please use [v22.8.4](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/v22.8.4). For iOS 11 support, please use [v21.13.0](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/v21.13.0). For iOS 10, please use [v19.4.0](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/v19.4.0). If you need to support iOS 9, use [v17.0.2](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/tree/v17.0.2).\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Integration\n\nGet started with our [📚 integration guides](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios) and [example projects](/Example), or [📘 browse the SDK reference](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/docs/index.html) for fine-grained documentation of all the classes and methods in the SDK.\n\n### Examples\n\n- [Prebuilt UI](Example/PaymentSheet%20Example) (Recommended)\n  - This example demonstrates how to build a payment flow using [`PaymentSheet`](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios), an embeddable native UI component that lets you accept [10+ payment methods](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods/integration-options#payment-method-product-support) with a single integration.\n\n- [Non-Card Payment Examples](Example/Non-Card%20Payment%20Examples)\n  - This example demonstrates how to manually accept various payment methods using the Stripe API.\n\n## Card scanning\n\n[PaymentSheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios) offers built-in card scanning. To enable card scanning, you'll need to set `NSCameraUsageDescription` in your application's plist, and provide a reason for accessing the camera (e.g. \"To scan cards\"). Card scanning is supported on devices with iOS 13 or higher.\n\nYou can demo this feature in our [PaymentSheet example app](Example/PaymentSheet%20Example). When you run the example app on a device, you'll see a \"Scan Card\" button when adding a new card.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions of any kind including new features, bug fixes, and documentation improvements. Please first open an issue describing what you want to build if it is a major change so that we can discuss how to move forward. Otherwise, go ahead and open a pull request for minor changes such as typo fixes and one liners.\n\n### Running tests\n\n1. From the root of the repo, run `bundle install && bundle exec fastlane stripeios_tests`. This will install the test dependencies and run the tests.\n2. Once you have run this once, you can also run the tests in Xcode from the `StripeiOS` target in `Stripe.xcworkspace`.\n\nTo re-record snapshot tests, use the `bundle exec ruby ci_scripts/snapshots.rb --record`.\n\n## Migrating from older versions\n\nSee [MIGRATING.md](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/blob/master/MIGRATING.md)\n\n## Code style\nWe use [swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce code style.\n\nTo install it, run `brew install swiftlint`\n\nTo lint your code before pushing you can run `ci_scripts/lint_modified_files.sh`\n\nYou can also add this script as a pre-push hook by running `ln -s \"$(pwd)/ci_scripts/lint_modified_files.sh\" .git/hooks/pre-push && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push`\n\nTo format modified files automatically, you can use `ci_scripts/format_modified_files.sh` and you can add it as a pre-commit hook using `ln -s \"$(pwd)/ci_scripts/format_modified_files.sh\" .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`\n\n## Licenses\n\n- [Stripe iOS SDK License](LICENSE)\n",

      "readme": "# Swift Syntax\n\nThe swift-syntax package is a set of libraries that work on a source-accurate tree representation of Swift source code, called the SwiftSyntax tree. The SwiftSyntax tree forms the backbone of Swift’s macro system – the macro expansion nodes are represented as SwiftSyntax nodes and a macro generates a SwiftSyntax tree to be inserted into the source file.\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can read SwiftSyntax’s documentation on [swiftpackageindex.com](https://swiftpackageindex.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/documentation).\n\nA great way to interactively explore the SwiftSyntax tree of a source file is https://swift-ast-explorer.com, developed by [@kishikawakatsumi](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi).\n\nA set of example usages of swift-syntax can be found in [Examples](Examples).\n\n## Releases\n\nReleases of SwiftSyntax are aligned with corresponding language and tooling releases, for example the major version 509 of swift-syntax is aligned with Swift 5.9. \n \nTo depend on swift-syntax in a SwiftPM package, add the following to your `Package.swift`.\n\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n  .package(url: \"https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax.git\", from: \"<#latest swift-syntax tag#>\"),\n],\n```\n \nTo add swift-syntax as a dependency of your Xcode project, go to the *Package Dependencies* tab of your Xcode project, click the plus button and search for https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax.git.\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nIf you should hit any issues while using SwiftSyntax, we appreciate bug reports on [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues).\n\n## Contributing\n\nStart contributing to SwiftSyntax see [this guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n\n## Bazel\n\nSwiftSyntax provides an experimental [Bazel](https://bazel.build) build configuration, maintained by Keith Smiley. \nTo use it, you can pull the source archive from the relevant release tag\ninto your `MODULE.bazel` file (preferred and recommended) with `bazel_dep`. Bzlmod support was added starting release of `509.0.0` and above. All available versions can be found in the [Bazel Central Registry](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/swift-syntax)\n\n```python3\nbazel_dep(name = \"swift-syntax\", version = \"600.0.1\")\n```\n\nYou can also pull source archive with `WORKSPACE` but note that it is preferred to use `MODULE.bazel`. To use `WORKSPACE` and swift-syntax, you can use `http_archive` as such\n\n```python3\nhttp_archive(\n    name = \"SwiftSyntax\",\n    sha256 = \"f070fd44db9b33f430fd5b5d2700f1e2001c0028711859600e80cc975074fab0\",\n    strip_prefix = \"swift-syntax-509.1.0\",\n    url = \"https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/archive/refs/tags/509.1.0.tar.gz\",\n)\n```\n\nand depend on the libraries you need from the\n[`BUILD.bazel`](BUILD.bazel) file. Each library also has an associated\n`Library_opt` target (such as `SwiftSyntax_opt`) which forces\nSwiftSyntax to always build with optimizations enabled. This may help\nlocal runtime performance at the cost of debuggability, and initial\nbuild time. Please tag any [issues](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-syntax/issues) related to the Bazel configuration with the label \"Bazel\".\n\n## License\n\nPlease see [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) for more information.\n",

The `ggplotly()` function itself\nhas some convenient “high-level” arguments, such as `dynamicTicks`,\nwhich tells plotly.js to dynamically recompute axes, when appropriate.\nThe `style()` function also comes in handy for *modifying* the\nunderlying trace\nattributes (e.g. [hoveron](https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter-hoveron)) used to generate the plot:\n\n``` r\ngg <- ggplotly(g, dynamicTicks = \"y\")\nstyle(gg, hoveron = \"points\", hoverinfo = \"x+y+text\", hoverlabel = list(bgcolor = \"white\"))\n```\n\n![<https://i.imgur.com/qRvLgea.gifv>](https://imgur.com/qRvLgea.gif)\n\nMoreover, since `ggplotly()` returns a plotly object, you can apply\nessentially any function from the R package on that object. Some useful\nones include `layout()` (for [customizing the\nlayout](https://plotly-r.com/improving-ggplotly.html#modifying-layout)),\n`add_traces()` (and its higher-level `add_*()` siblings, for example\n`add_polygons()`, for [adding new\ntraces/data](https://plotly-r.com/improving-ggplotly.html#leveraging-statistical-output)),\n`subplot()` (for [combining multiple plotly\nobjects](https://plotly-r.com/arranging-views.html#arranging-plotly-objects)),\nand `plotly_json()` (for inspecting the underlying JSON sent to\nplotly.js).\n\nThe `ggplotly()` function will also respect some “unofficial”\n**ggplot2** aesthetics, namely `text` (for [customizing the\ntooltip](https://plotly-r.com/controlling-tooltips.html#tooltip-text-ggplotly)),\n`frame` (for [creating\nanimations](https://plotly-r.com/animating-views.html)),\nand `ids` (for ensuring sensible smooth transitions).\n\n### Using plotly without ggplot2\n\nThe `plot_ly()` function provides a more direct interface to plotly.js\nso you can leverage more specialized chart types (e.g., [parallel\ncoordinates](https://plotly.com/r/parallel-coordinates-plot/) or\n[maps](https://plotly.com/r/maps/)) or even some visualization that the\nggplot2 API won’t ever support (e.g., surface,\n[mesh](https://plotly.com/r/3d-mesh/),\n[trisurf](https://plotly.com/r/trisurf/), etc).\n\n``` r\nplot_ly(z = ~volcano, type = \"surface\")\n```\n\n![<https://plotly.com/~brnvg/1134>](https://plotly.com/~brnvg/1134.png)\n\n## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about special features that the plotly R package provides (e.g., [client-side linking](https://plotly-r.com/client-side-linking.html), [**shiny** integration](https://plotly-r.com/linking-views-with-shiny.html), [editing and generating static images](https://plotly-r.com/publish.html), [custom events in JavaScript](https://plotly-r.com/javascript.html), and more), see <https://plotly-r.com>. You may already be familiar with existing plotly documentation (e.g., <https://plotly.com/r/>), which is essentially a language-agnostic how-to guide for learning plotly.js, whereas <https://plotly-r.com> is meant to be more wholistic tutorial written by and for the R user. The package itself ships with a number of demos (list them by running `demo(package = \"plotly\")`) and shiny/rmarkdown examples (list them by running `plotly_example(\"shiny\")` or `plotly_example(\"rmd\")`). [Carson](https://cpsievert.me) also keeps numerous [slide decks](https://talks.cpsievert.me) with useful examples and concepts.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read through our [contributing\nguidelines](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\nIncluded are directions for opening issues, asking questions,\ncontributing changes to plotly, and our code of\nconduct.\n",

If you experience that R tries to install `sf` from source (or otherwise your install fails but you don't understand what is going on) try again by explicitly installing the binary, using\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"sf\", type = \"binary\")\n```\n\nThe remainder of this section is for those who understand what source installs mean, and imply.\n\nPerhaps the easiest way of an install from source is to first install `gdal` using Homebrew. Recent versions of Homebrew include a full-featured up-to-date [gdal formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/g/gdal.rb), which installs `proj` and `gdal` at the same time:\n\n```\nbrew install pkg-config\nbrew install gdal\n```\n\nOnce gdal is installed, you may be able to install `sf` package from source in R. With the current version of `proj` on homebrew, installation requires additional configuration:\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"sf\", type = \"source\", configure.args = \"--with-proj-lib=$(brew --prefix)/lib/\")\n```\n\nOr the development version:\n\n```r\nlibrary(remotes)\ninstall_github(\"r-spatial/sf\", configure.args = \"--with-proj-lib=$(brew --prefix)/lib/\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, [these instructions](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2017-June/012429.html) explain how to install gdal using kyngchaos frameworks.\n\nFor Mac OS 11 Big Sur source install instruction, see [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1536#issuecomment-727342736)\n\n### Linux\n\nFor Unix-alikes, GDAL (>= 2.0.1), GEOS (>= 3.4.0) and Proj.4 (>= 4.8.0) are required.\n\n#### Ubuntu\n\nDependencies for recent versions of Ubuntu (18.04 and later) are available in the official repositories; you can install them with:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt -y update && apt install -y libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev libsqlite3-dev\n```\n\nHowever, to get more up-to-date versions of dependencies such as GDAL, GEOS and PROJ we recommend adding the [ubuntugis-unstable](http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu/) PPA to the package repositories and installing them as follows:\n\n```sh\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev libgeos-dev libproj-dev libsqlite3-dev\n```\n\nAdding this PPA is required for installing `sf` on older versions of Ubuntu (e.g. Xenial).\n\nAnother option, for advanced users, is to install dependencies from source; see e.g. an older [Travis](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/blob/593ee48b34001fe3b383ea73ea57063ecf690732/.travis.yml) config file for hints.\n\n#### Fedora\nThe following command installs all required dependencies:\n```sh\nsudo dnf install gdal-devel proj-devel geos-devel sqlite-devel udunits2-devel\n```\n\n#### Arch\n\nGet gdal, proj, geos and podofo from the main repos, and udunits from the AUR:\n\n```\npacman -S gdal proj geos arrow podofo\nyay/pacaur/yaourt/whatever -S udunits\n```\n\n#### `renv` or `conda`\n\nThere are several reports that `sf` fails to install as a source package when R is used with `renv`, or when R is installed in a `conda` environment. If you experience this, please do not raise an issue here, but \n\n* try to sort this out with the `renv` developers or the `conda` maintainers, or\n* try to use binary installs of the `sf` package, e.g. from [r2u](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/r2u), or the Posit package manager\n\n#### Other\n\nTo install on Debian, the [rocker geospatial](https://github.com/rocker-org/geospatial) Dockerfiles may be helpful. Ubuntu Dockerfiles are found [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/tree/main/inst/docker).\n\n### Multiple GDAL, GEOS and/or PROJ versions on your system\n\nIf you use dynamic linking (installation from source) and have multiple versions of these libraries installed (e.g. one from ubuntugis-unstable, another installed from source in `/usr/local/lib`) then this will in general not work, even when setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` manually. See [here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/844) for the reason why. \n\n### lwgeom\n\nFunctions and methods that require `liblwgeom`, including ellipsoidal (not spherical or Euclidean) metrics (area, distances), are provide by and used from [lwgeom](https://github.com/r-spatial/lwgeom), which is also on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lwgeom).\n\n## Contributing\n\n* Contributions of all sorts are most welcome, issues and pull requests are the preferred ways of sharing them.\n* When contributing pull requests, please adhere to the package style (in package code use `=` rather than `<-`; don't change indentation; tab stops of 4 spaces are preferred).\n* This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md).

      "readme": "# Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM)\n\nThe Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) of the Pacific \nNorthwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is the home and primary \ndevelopment institution for GCAM, a multisector model for exploring \nconsequences of and responses to global to local changes and stressors. \nRegional energy, water, land, and economic systems are connected to the\nrest of the globe through trade and interactions with environmental systems.\nThese systems are also connected with each other.\nMultisector models such as GCAM capture these \ninterconnected impacts in an economic framework in order to explore \nthese dynamic interactions and feedbacks between regions and sectors.\n\nGCAM has been developed at PNNL-JGCRI for over 20 years and is a freely\navailable community model and documented online (See below). The team\nat JGCRI is comprised of physical scientists, engineers, economists, energy\nexperts, forest ecologists, agricultural scientists, and environmental system\nscientists who develop the model and apply it to a range of research questions.\nThe JGCRI team works closely with the developers of other Earth system and\necosystem models to integrate the effects of human actions modeled in GCAM\ninto their research.\n\n## Model Overview\n\nGCAM is a dynamic-recursive model with technology-rich representations\nof the economy, energy sector, land use, and water linked to a reduced complexity\nEarth system model that can be used to explore many science and decision-relevant\nquestions including the effects of changes in trade patterns, critical minerals\n& materials availability, and deployment of energy technologies on human and\nEarth systems. Regional population and labor productivity growth assumptions\ndrive the energy and land-use systems, employing numerous technology options to\nproduce, transform, and provide energy services, as well as to produce\nagriculture and forest products, and to determine land use and land cover.\nUsing a run period extending from 1990 – 2100 (historical years through 2021)\nwith annual results computed at 1-5 year intervals, GCAM has been used to\nexplore the potential role of emerging energy supply technologies and\nthe consequences of specific measures or energy technology adoption, including\nbioenergy; critical minerals & materials; hydrogen systems; nuclear energy;\nrenewable energy technologies; carbon capture, storage, and utilization and\nenergy use technology in buildings, industry, and the transportation\nsectors. GCAM outputs include projections of future energy and critical mineral\nsupply, trade, and demand and the resulting radiative forcing and other effects\nof 16 greenhouse gases, aerosols, and short-lived species at 0.5×0.5 degree\nresolution, contingent on assumptions about future population, economy, technology,\ntrade and other polices.\n\n## Community guidelines for peer-reviewed journal articles using GCAM\n\nThis section outlines some suggested language which the GCAM user community \ncan employ to describe GCAM in papers in peer-reviewed journal articles,\nreports, or other public documents using GCAM or versions of GCAM. GCAM is\nunder continuous development. The suggested language for the opening paragraphs\nof a methodology or introduction section of a paper describing GCAM is as\nfollows:\n\n\"The Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) is a multisector model developed and maintained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI, 2023) _\\<include additional citations to previous GCAM studies as relevant\\>_. GCAM is an open-source community model. In this study, we use GCAM v NN. The documentation of the model is available at the GCAM documentation page ([http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc](http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc)) and the description below is a summary. GCAM includes representations of: economy, energy, agriculture, and water supply in 32 geopolitical regions across the globe; their GHG and air pollutant emissions and global GHG concentrations, radiative forcing, and temperature change; and the associated land allocation, water use, and agriculture production across 396 land sub-regions and 235 water basins.  _\\<If using GCAM-USA, include without quotes: \"This study uses a U.S.-focused version of GCAM called GCAM-USA that includes representation of energy, economy, and water systems for the fifty states and the District of Columbia in addition to 31 regions outside of the United States.”\\>_. The version of GCAM used in this study is available – along with full source code and instructions for use – in a public repository _\\<include citation including link to the GCAM repository with doi used in paper\\>_. \n\nSubsequent paragraphs of the description might expound on particular capabilities, systems, or sectors of focus in the paper. Details in the GCAM documentation page can be used as a reference to develop these paragraphs.\n\nCommunity users of GCAM might also undertake their own model developments and/or assumptions for papers. It is recommended that these departures from the publicly available version of the model be clearly described. In addition, if these developments are substantial, we suggest making this clear by including an additional phrase (e.g. region name or name of institution) in the name of the model and explicitly calling it out in place of or immediately following the italicized portion in the above paragraphs. For example: _\"This study uses a modified version of GCAM/GCAM-USA called GCAM-\\<institution name\\>/GCAM-USA-\\<institution name\\>. GCAM-\\<institution name\\>/GCAM-USA-\\<institution name\\> incorporates additional details and modified assumptions from GCAM v NN as described subsequently\"_. \n\n## Documentation\n\n* [GCAM Documentation](http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/)\n* [Getting Started with GCAM](http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/user-guide.html)\n* [GCAM Community](https://gcims.pnnl.gov/community)\n* [GCAM Videos and Tutorial Slides](https://gcims.pnnl.gov/community)\n* [GCAM Citation and Co-authorship Guidelines](http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/community-guide.html)\n\n## Selected Publications\n\nCalvin, K., Patel, P., Clarke, L., Asrar, G., Bond-Lamberty, B., Cui, R.

This package has two main goals:\n\n1. To make updating R (on windows) as easy as running a function.\n2. To make it as easy as possible to install all of the needed software for R development (such as git, RTools, etc), as well as for reproducible research using R (such as MikTeX, pandoc, etc).\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nWhile for Linux users, the installation process of new software may be just running a short line of code, for the regular Windows user it often includes browsing online, finding the latest version, downloading it, running the installer, and deleting the installation file. All of these steps are automatically done using functions in this package.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the stable version on CRAN:\n\n```r\ninstall.packages('installr')\n```\n\nTo install the latest installr version from GitHub use:\n\n```r\nif (!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes'); # make sure you have Rtools installed first! if not, then run:\n#install.packages('installr')\n#install.Rtools()\nremotes::install_github('talgalili/installr')\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you are using the Rgui, you will see a new menu added on your top right (just by \"help\"), giving you the option to update R, or install new software.\n\nFor command line use you can **update R** by running:\n\n```r\nif(!require(\"installr\")) install.packages('installr')\nlibrary(\"installr\")\nupdateR() # this will open dialog boxes to take you through the steps.\n# OR use:\n# updateR(TRUE) # this will use common defaults and will be the safest/fastest option\n```\n\nOr **install a new software** simply by running:\n\n```r\nlibrary(\"installr\")\ninstallr() #  user can easily select (via a GUI interface) a software to install.\n```\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you get either of the following errors from some commands:\n\n```r\nError in download.file(URL, destfile = ...) : \n  unsupported URL scheme\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```r\ninstall.RStudio()\nError in file(con, \"r\") : cannot open the connection\nupdateR()\nError in file(con, \"r\") : cannot open the connection\n```\n\n\nTry running:\n\n```r\nsetInternet2(TRUE)\n```\n\nSources: \n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21857264/error-in-download-file-unsupported-url-scheme\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19890633/r-produces-unsupported-url-scheme-error-when-getting-data-from-https-sites\n\n\n## Contact\n\nYou are welcome to:\n\n* submit suggestions and bug-reports at: <https://github.com/talgalili/installr/issues>\n* send a pull request on: <https://github.com/talgalili/installr/>\n* compose a friendly e-mail to: <tal.galili@gmail.com>\n\n\n## Available functions are:\n\nYou can see the most recent changes to the package in the NEWS.md file:\n\nhttp://talgalili.github.io/installr/news/index.html\n\n\n# Code of conduct\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/talgalili/installr/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).

      "readme": "# tree-sitter-r\n\nAn R grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).\n\n## R package\n\nThis grammar is available as an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treesitter.r/index.html).\n\nYou'll also want the [R package providing bindings to tree-sitter](https://davisvaughan.github.io/r-tree-sitter/) itself.\n\n## Rust bindings\n\nThis grammar is available as a [Rust crate on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tree-sitter-r).\n\n## Node bindings\n\nThis grammar is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@davisvaughan/tree-sitter-r).\n\nNote that it is currently listed as a scoped package under the name `@davisvaughan/tree-sitter-r`.\nWe are working with the npm team to gain ownership of the `tree-sitter-r` package.\nOnce that happens, we will move the npm package there instead.\n\n## References\n\n- [The R Draft Spec](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.pdf)\n- [gram.y](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/src/main/gram.y)\n\n## Known deviations\n\nThis section describes known deviations from the R grammar.\n\n### `]]` as a literal token\n\nThe following is valid R syntax, note how `]]` has been split over multiple lines.\n\n```r\nx[[\"a\"]\n]\n```\n\nThis applies to `]]`, but not to `[[`, for example, this is not valid R syntax:\n\n```r\nx[\n[\"a\"]]\n```\n\nThe technical reason for this is that [in the grammar](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/988774e05497bcf2cfac47bfbec59d551432e3fb/src/main/gram.y#L508) R treats `[[` as a single token, but `]]` is treated as two individual `]` tokens.\nTreating `]]` as two individual `]` tokens allows whitespace, newlines, and even comments to appear between the two `]` tokens:\n\n```r\nx[[\"a\"] # comment\n]\n```\n\nWhile we'd like to precisely support the R grammar, it is also extremely useful to treat all of `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `[[`, and `]]` as literal tokens when using the tree-sitter grammar.\nThis allows you to treat call, subset, and subset2 nodes in the same way, since they all have exactly the same node structure.\n\nBecause treating `]]` as a literal token is so useful, and because we've never seen any R code \"in the wild\" written this way, this grammar does not allow whitespace, newlines, or comments between the two `]` tokens.\n",
