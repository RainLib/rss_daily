Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to:\n\n- Easily switch between different coding agents\n- Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence\n- Quickly review work and start dev servers\n- Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on\n- Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs\n- Open projects remotely via SSH when running Vibe Kanban on a remote server\n\nYou can watch a video overview [here](https://youtu.be/TFT3KnZOOAk).\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have authenticated with your favourite coding agent. A full list of supported coding agents can be found in the [docs](https://vibekanban.com/docs). Then in your terminal run:\n\n```bash\nnpx vibe-kanban\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease head to the [website](https://vibekanban.com/docs) for the latest documentation and user guides.\n\n## Support\n\nWe use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) for feature requests. Please open a discussion to create a feature request. For bugs please open an issue on this repo.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe would prefer that ideas and changes are first raised with the core team via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/AC4nwVtJM3), where we can discuss implementation details and alignment with the existing roadmap. Please do not open PRs without first discussing your proposal with the team.\n\n## Development\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=18)\n- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (>=8)\n\nAdditional development tools:\n```bash\ncargo install cargo-watch\ncargo install sqlx-cli\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n```bash\npnpm i\n```\n\n### Running the dev server\n\n```bash\npnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis will start the backend. A blank DB will be copied from the `dev_assets_seed` folder.\n\n### Building the frontend\n\nTo build just the frontend:\n\n```bash\ncd frontend\npnpm build\n```\n\n### Build from source (macOS)\n\n1. Run `./local-build.sh`\n2. Test with `cd npx-cli && node bin/cli.js`\n\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nThe following environment variables can be configured at build time or runtime:\n\n| Variable | Type | Default | Description |\n|----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics API key (disables analytics if empty) |\n| `POSTHOG_API_ENDPOINT` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics endpoint (disables analytics if empty) |\n| `PORT` | Runtime | Auto-assign | **Production**: Server port. **Dev**: Frontend port (backend uses PORT+1) |\n| `BACKEND_PORT` | Runtime | `0` (auto-assign) | Backend server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT+1) |\n| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Runtime | `3000` | Frontend dev server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT) |\n| `HOST` | Runtime | `127.0.0.1` | Backend server host |\n| `DISABLE_WORKTREE_ORPHAN_CLEANUP` | Runtime | Not set | Disable git worktree cleanup (for debugging) |\n\n**Build-time variables** must be set when running `pnpm run build`. **Runtime variables** are read when the application starts.\n\n### Remote Deployment\n\nWhen running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (e.g., via systemctl, Docker, or cloud hosting), you can configure your editor to open projects via SSH:\n\n1. **Access via tunnel**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or similar to expose the web UI\n2. **Configure remote SSH** in Settings → Editor Integration:\n   - Set **Remote SSH Host** to your server hostname or IP\n   - Set **Remote SSH User** to your SSH username (optional)\n3. **Prerequisites**:\n   - SSH access from your local machine to the remote server\n   - SSH keys configured (passwordless authentication)\n   - VSCode Remote-SSH extension\n\nWhen configured, the \"Open in VSCode\" buttons will generate URLs like `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path` that open your local editor and connect to the remote server.\n\nSee the [documentation](https://vibekanban.com/docs/configuration-customisation/global-settings#remote-ssh-configuration) for detailed setup instructions.\n",

For the packages installable inside the app, see [termux/termux-packages](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages).\n\nQuick how-to about Termux package management is available at [Package Management](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Package-Management). It also has info on how to fix **`repository is under maintenance or down`** errors when running `apt` or `pkg` commands.\n\n**We are looking for Termux Android application maintainers.**\n\n***\n\n**NOTICE: Termux may be unstable on Android 12+.** Android OS will kill any (phantom) processes greater than 32 (limit is for all apps combined) and also kill any processes using excessive CPU. You may get `[Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter]` message in the terminal without actually exiting the shell process yourself. Check the related issue [#2366](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366), [issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/205156966), [phantom cached and empty processes docs](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/Android-Docs/blob/master/en/docs/apps/processes/phantom-cached-and-empty-processes.md) and [this TLDR comment](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366#issuecomment-1237468220) on how to disable trimming of phantom and excessive cpu usage processes. A proper docs page will be added later. An option to disable the killing should be available in Android 12L or 13, so upgrade at your own risk if you are on Android 11, specially if you are not rooted.\n\n***\n\n## Contents\n- [Termux App and Plugins](#termux-app-and-plugins)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Uninstallation](#uninstallation)\n- [Important Links](#important-links)\n- [Debugging](#debugging)\n- [For Maintainers and Contributors](#for-maintainers-and-contributors)\n- [Forking](#forking)\n- [Sponsors and Funders](#sponsors-and-funders)\n##\n\n\n\n## Termux App and Plugins\n\nThe core [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) app comes with the following optional plugin apps.\n\n- [Termux:API](https://github.com/termux/termux-api)\n- [Termux:Boot](https://github.com/termux/termux-boot)\n- [Termux:Float](https://github.com/termux/termux-float)\n- [Termux:Styling](https://github.com/termux/termux-styling)\n- [Termux:Tasker](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker)\n- [Termux:Widget](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget)\n##\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\nLatest version is `v0.118.3`.\n\n**NOTICE: It is highly recommended that you update to `v0.118.0` or higher ASAP for various bug fixes, including a critical world-readable vulnerability reported [here](https://termux.github.io/general/2022/02/15/termux-apps-vulnerability-disclosures.html). See [below](#google-play-store-experimental-branch) for information regarding Termux on Google Play.**\n\nTermux can be obtained through various sources listed below for **only** Android `>= 7` with full support for apps and packages.\n\nSupport for both app and packages was dropped for Android `5` and `6` on [2020-01-01](https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/dnzdbs/end_of_android56_support_on_20200101/) at `v0.83`, however it was re-added just for the app *without any support for package updates* on [2022-05-24](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/2740) via the [GitHub](#github) sources. Check [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-on-android-5-or-6) for the details.\n\nThe APK files of different sources are signed with different signature keys. The `Termux` app and all its plugins use the same [`sharedUserId`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element) `com.termux` and so all their APKs installed on a device must have been signed with the same signature key to work together and so they must all be installed from the same source. Do not attempt to mix them together, i.e do not try to install an app or plugin from `F-Droid` and another one from a different source like `GitHub`. Android Package Manager will also normally not allow installation of APKs with different signatures and you will get errors on installation like `App not installed`, `Failed to install due to an unknown error`, `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`, `INSTALL_FAILED_SHARED_USER_INCOMPATIBLE`, `signatures do not match previously installed version`, etc. This restriction can be bypassed with root or with custom roms.\n\nIf you wish to install from a different source, then you must **uninstall any and all existing Termux or its plugin app APKs** from your device first, then install all new APKs from the same new source. Check [Uninstallation](#uninstallation) section for details. You may also want to consider [Backing up Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux) before the uninstallation so that you can restore it after re-installing from Termux different source.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, *\"bootstrap\"* refers to the minimal packages that are shipped with the `termux-app` itself to start a working shell environment. Its zips are built and released [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/releases).\n\n### F-Droid\n\nTermux application can be obtained from `F-Droid` from [here](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).\n\nYou **do not** need to download the `F-Droid` app (via the `Download F-Droid` link) to install Termux. You can download the Termux APK directly from the site by clicking the `Download APK` link at the bottom of each version section.\n\nIt usually takes a few days (or even a week or more) for updates to be available on `F-Droid` once an update has been released on `GitHub`. The `F-Droid` releases are built and published by `F-Droid` once they [detect](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/com.termux.yml) a new `GitHub` release. The Termux maintainers **do not** have any control over the building and publishing of the Termux apps on `F-Droid`. Moreover, the Termux maintainers also do not have access to the APK signing keys of `F-Droid` releases, so we cannot release an APK ourselves on `GitHub` that would be compatible with `F-Droid` releases.\n\nThe `F-Droid` app often may not notify you of updates and you will manually have to do a pull down swipe action in the `Updates` tab of the app for it to check updates. Make sure battery optimizations are disabled for the app, check https://dontkillmyapp.com/ for details on how to do that.\n\nOnly a universal APK is released, which will work on all supported architectures. The APK and bootstrap installation size will be `~180MB`. `F-Droid` does [not support](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/1904) architecture specific APKs.\n\n### GitHub\n\nTermux application can be obtained on `GitHub` either from [`GitHub Releases`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases) for version `>= 0.118.0` or from [`GitHub Build Action`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/actions/workflows/debug_build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush) workflows. **For android `>= 7`, only install `apt-android-7` variants. For android `5` and `6`, only install `apt-android-5` variants.**\n\nThe APKs for `GitHub Releases` will be listed under `Assets` drop-down of a release. These are automatically attached when a new version is released.\n\nThe APKs for `GitHub Build` action workflows will be listed under `Artifacts` section of a workflow run. These are created for each commit/push done to the repository and can be used by users who don't want to wait for releases and want to try out the latest features immediately or want to test their pull requests. Note that for action workflows, you need to be [**logged into a `GitHub` account**](https://github.com/login) for the `Artifacts` links to be enabled/clickable. If you are using the [`GitHub` app](https://github.com/mobile), then make sure to open workflow link in a browser like Chrome or Firefox that has your GitHub account logged in since the in-app browser may not be logged in.\n\nThe APKs for both of these are [`debuggable`](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug) and are compatible with each other but they are not compatible with other sources.\n\nBoth universal and architecture specific APKs are released. The APK and bootstrap installation size will be `~180MB` if using universal and `~120MB` if using architecture specific. Check [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2153) for details.\n\n**Security warning**: APK files on GitHub are signed with a test key that has been [shared with community](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks). This IS NOT an official developer key and everyone can use it to generate releases for own testing. Be very careful when using Termux GitHub builds obtained elsewhere except https://github.com/termux/termux-app. Everyone is able to use it to forge a malicious Termux update installable over the GitHub build. Think twice about installing Termux builds distributed via Telegram or other social media. If your device get caught by malware, we will not be able to help you.\n\nThe [test key](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks) shall not be used to impersonate @termux and can't be used for this anyway. This key is not trusted by us and it is quite easy to detect its use in user generated content.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Keystore information</summary>\n\n```\nAlias name: alias\nCreation date: Oct 4, 2019\nEntry type: PrivateKeyEntry\nCertificate chain length: 1\nCertificate[1]:\nOwner: CN=APK Signer, OU=Earth, O=Earth\nIssuer: CN=APK Signer, OU=Earth, O=Earth\nSerial number: 29be297b\nValid from: Wed Sep 04 02:03:24 EEST 2019 until: Tue Oct 26 02:03:24 EEST 2049\nCertificate fingerprints:\n         SHA1: 51:79:55:EA:BF:69:FC:05:7C:41:C7:D3:79:DB:BC:EF:20:AD:85:F2\n         SHA256: B6:DA:01:48:0E:EF:D5:FB:F2:CD:37:71:B8:D1:02:1E:C7:91:30:4B:DD:6C:4B:F4:1D:3F:AA:BA:D4:8E:E5:E1\nSignature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA (disabled)\nSubject Public Key Algorithm: 2048-bit RSA key\nVersion: 3\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Google Play Store **(Experimental branch)**\n\nThere is currently a build of Termux available on Google Play for Android 11+ devices, with extensive adjustments in order to pass policy requirements there. This is under development and has missing functionality and bugs (see [here](https://github.com/termux-play-store/) for status updates) compared to the stable F-Droid build, which is why most users who can should still use F-Droid or GitHub build as mentioned above.\n\nCurrently, Google Play will try to update installations away from F-Droid ones. Updating will still fail as [sharedUserId](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element#uid) has been removed. A planned 0.118.1 F-Droid release will fix this by setting a higher version code than used for the PlayStore app. Meanwhile, to prevent Google Play from attempting to download and then fail to install the Google Play releases over existing installations, you can open the Termux apps pages on Google Play and then click on the 3 dots options button in the top right and then disable the Enable auto update toggle. However, the Termux apps updates will still show in the PlayStore app updates list.\n\nIf you want to help out with testing the Google Play build (or cannot install Termux from other sources), be aware that it's built from a separate repository (https://github.com/termux-play-store/) - be sure to report issues [there](https://github.com/termux-play-store/termux-issues/issues/new/choose), as any issues encountered might very well be specific to that repository.\n\n## Uninstallation\n\nUninstallation may be required if a user doesn't want Termux installed in their device anymore or is switching to a different [install source](#installation). You may also want to consider [Backing up Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux) before the uninstallation.\n\nTo uninstall Termux completely, you must uninstall **any and all existing Termux or its plugin app APKs** listed in [Termux App and Plugins](#termux-app-and-plugins).\n\nGo to `Android Settings` -> `Applications` and then look for those apps. You can also use the search feature if it’s available on your device and search `termux` in the applications list.\n\nEven if you think you have not installed any of the plugins, it's strongly suggested to go through the application list in Android settings and double-check.\n##\n\n\n\n## Important Links\n\n### Community\nAll community links are available [here](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Community).\n\nThe main ones are the following.\n\n- [Termux Reddit community](https://reddit.com/r/termux)\n- [Termux User Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#termux_termux:gitter.im) ([Gitter](https://gitter.im/termux/termux))\n- [Termux Dev Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#termux_dev:gitter.im) ([Gitter](https://gitter.im/termux/dev))\n- [Termux X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/termuxdevs)\n- [Termux Support Email](mailto:support@termux.dev)\n\n### Wikis\n\n- [Termux Wiki](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/)\n- [Termux App Wiki](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki)\n- [Termux Packages Wiki](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- [FAQ](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/FAQ)\n- [Termux File System Layout](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-file-system-layout)\n- [Differences From Linux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux)\n- [Package Management](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Package_Management)\n- [Remote Access](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access)\n- [Backing up Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux)\n- [Terminal Settings](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Terminal_Settings)\n- [Touch Keyboard](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard)\n- [Android Storage and Sharing Data with Other Apps](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Internal_and_external_storage)\n- [Android APIs](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API)\n- [Moved Termux Packages Hosting From Bintray to IPFS](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/6348)\n- [Running Commands in Termux From Other Apps via `RUN_COMMAND` intent](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent)\n- [Termux and Android 10](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-and-Android-10)\n\n\n### Terminal\n\n<details>\n<summary></summary>\n\n### Terminal resources\n\n- [XTerm control sequences](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html)\n- [vt100.net](https://vt100.net/)\n- [Terminal codes (ANSI and terminfo equivalents)](https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes)\n\n### Terminal emulators\n\n- VTE (libvte): Terminal emulator widget for GTK+, mainly used in gnome-terminal.

The `Log Level` defaults to `Normal` and log level `Verbose` currently logs additional information. Its best to revert log level to `Normal` after you have finished debugging since private data may otherwise be passed to `logcat` during normal operation and moreover, additional logging increases execution time.\n\nThe plugin apps **do not execute the commands themselves** but send execution intents to `Termux` app, which has its own log level which can be set in `Termux` app settings -> `Termux` -> `Debugging` -> `Log Level`. So you must set log level for both `Termux` and the respective plugin app settings to get all the info.\n\nOnce log levels have been set, you can run the `logcat` command in `Termux` app terminal to view the logs in realtime (`Ctrl+c` to stop) or use `logcat -d > logcat.txt` to take a dump of the log. You can also view the logs from a PC over `ADB`. For more information, check official android `logcat` guide [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat).\n\nMoreover, users can generate termux files `stat` info and `logcat` dump automatically too with terminal's long hold options menu `More` -> `Report Issue` option and selecting `YES` in the prompt shown to add debug info. This can be helpful for reporting and debugging other issues. If the report generated is too large, then `Save To File` option in context menu (3 dots on top right) of `ReportActivity` can be used and the file viewed/shared instead.\n\nUsers must post complete report (optionally without sensitive info) when reporting issues. Issues opened with **(partial) screenshots of error reports** instead of text will likely be automatically closed/deleted.\n\n##### Log Levels\n\n- `Off` - Log nothing.\n- `Normal` - Start logging error, warn and info messages and stacktraces.\n- `Debug` - Start logging debug messages.\n- `Verbose` - Start logging verbose messages.\n##\n\n\n\n## For Maintainers and Contributors\n\nThe [termux-shared](termux-shared) library was added in [`v0.109`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.109). It defines shared constants and utils of the Termux app and its plugins. It was created to allow for the removal of all hardcoded paths in the Termux app. Some of the termux plugins are using this as well and rest will in future. If you are contributing code that is using a constant or a util that may be shared, then define it in `termux-shared` library if it currently doesn't exist and reference it from there. Update the relevant changelogs as well. Pull requests using hardcoded values **will/should not** be accepted. Termux app and plugin specific classes must be added under `com.termux.shared.termux` package and general classes outside it. The [`termux-shared` `LICENSE`](termux-shared/LICENSE.md) must also be checked and updated if necessary when contributing code. The licenses of any external library or code must be honoured.\n\nThe main Termux constants are defined by [`TermuxConstants`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java) class. It also contains information on how to fork Termux or build it with your own package name. Changing the package name will require building the bootstrap zip packages and other packages with the new `$PREFIX`, check [Building Packages](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Building-packages) for more info.\n\nCheck [Termux Libraries](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries) for how to import termux libraries in plugin apps and [Forking and Local Development](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries#forking-and-local-development) for how to update termux libraries for plugins.\n\nThe `versionName` in `build.gradle` files of Termux and its plugin apps must follow the [semantic version `2.0.0` spec](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) in the format `major.minor.patch(-prerelease)(+buildmetadata)`. When bumping `versionName` in `build.gradle` files and when creating a tag for new releases on GitHub, make sure to include the patch number as well, like `v0.1.0` instead of just `v0.1`. The `build.gradle` files and `attach_debug_apks_to_release` workflow validates the version as well and the build/attachment will fail if `versionName` does not follow the spec.\n\n### Commit Messages Guidelines\n\nCommit messages **must** use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) spec so that chagelogs as per the [Keep a Changelog](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog) spec can automatically be generated by the [`create-conventional-changelog`](https://github.com/termux/create-conventional-changelog) script, check its repo for further details on the spec. **The first letter for `type` and `description` must be capital and description should be in the present tense.** The space after the colon `:` is necessary. For a breaking change, add an exclamation mark `!` before the colon `:`, so that it is highlighted in the chagelog automatically.\n\n```\n<type>[optional scope]: <description>\n\n[optional body]\n\n[optional footer(s)]\n```\n\n**Only the `types` listed below must be used exactly as they are used in the changelog headings.** For example, `Added: Add foo`, `Added|Fixed: Add foo and fix bar`, `Changed!: Change baz as a breaking change`, etc. You can optionally add a scope as well, like `Fixed(terminal): Fix some bug`. **Do not use anything else as type, like `add` instead of `Added`, etc.**\n\n- **Added** for new features.\n- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.\n- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features.\n- **Removed** for now removed features.\n- **Fixed** for any bug fixes.\n- **Security** in case of vulnerabilities.\n##\n\n\n\n## Forking\n\n- Check [`TermuxConstants`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java) javadocs for instructions on what changes to make in the app to change package name.\n- You also need to recompile bootstrap zip for the new package name. Check [building bootstrap](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/For-maintainers#build-bootstrap-archives), [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/1983) and [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2081#issuecomment-865280111).\n- Currently, not all plugins use `TermuxConstants` from `termux-shared` library and have hardcoded `com.termux` values and will need to be manually patched.\n- If forking termux plugins, check [Forking and Local Development](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries#forking-and-local-development) for info on how to use termux libraries for plugins.\n##\n\n\n\n## Sponsors and Funders\n\n[<img alt=\"GitHub Accelerator\" width=\"25%\" src=\"site/assets/sponsors/github.png\" />](https://github.com)  \n*[GitHub Accelerator](https://github.com/accelerator) ([1](https://github.blog/2023-04-12-github-accelerator-our-first-cohort-and-whats-next))*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[<img alt=\"GitHub Secure Open Source Fund\" width=\"25%\" src=\"site/assets/sponsors/github.png\" />](https://github.com)  \n*[GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://resources.github.com/github-secure-open-source-fund) ([1](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/securing-the-supply-chain-at-scale-starting-with-71-important-open-source-projects), [2](https://termux.dev/en/posts/general/2025/08/11/termux-selected-for-github-secure-open-source-fund-session-2.html))*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[<img alt=\"NLnet NGI Mobifree\" width=\"25%\" src=\"site/assets/sponsors/nlnet-ngi-mobifree.png\" />](https://nlnet.nl/mobifree)  \n*[NLnet NGI Mobifree](https://nlnet.nl/mobifree) ([1](https://nlnet.nl/news/2024/20241111-NGI-Mobifree-grants.html), [2](https://termux.dev/en/posts/general/2024/11/11/termux-selected-for-nlnet-ngi-mobifree-grant.html))*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[<img alt=\"Cloudflare\" width=\"25%\" src=\"site/assets/sponsors/cloudflare.png\" />](https://www.cloudflare.com)  \n*[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) ([1](https://packages-cf.termux.dev))*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[<img alt=\"Warp\" width=\"25%\" src=\"https://github.com/warpdotdev/brand-assets/blob/640dffd347439bbcb535321ab36b7281cf4446c0/Github/Sponsor/Warp-Github-LG-03.png\" />](https://www.warp.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=termux)  \n[*Warp, built for coding with multiple AI agents*](https://www.warp.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=termux)\n",

It is free and open-source forever!\n\n## WARNING\n\nBevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can't guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.\n\n**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.\nAs a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to \"the latest stable release\" of Rust.\n\n## Design Goals\n\n* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set\n* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users\n* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm\n* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like\n* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel\n* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun\n\n## About\n\n* **[Features](https://bevy.org):** A quick overview of Bevy's features.\n* **[News](https://bevy.org/news/)**: A development blog that covers our progress, plans and shiny new features.\n\n## Docs\n\n* **[Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction):** Bevy's official Quick Start Guide. The best place to start learning Bevy.\n* **[Bevy Rust API Docs](https://docs.rs/bevy):** Bevy's Rust API docs, which are automatically generated from the doc comments in this repo.\n* **[Official Examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples):** Bevy's dedicated, runnable examples, which are great for digging into specific concepts.\n* **[Community-Made Learning Resources](https://bevy.org/assets/#learning)**: More tutorials, documentation, and examples made by the Bevy community.\n\n## Community\n\nBefore contributing or participating in discussions with the community, you should familiarize yourself with our [**Code of Conduct**](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n* **[Discord](https://discord.gg/bevy):** Bevy's official discord server.\n* **[Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/bevy):** Bevy's official subreddit.\n* **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions):** The best place for questions about Bevy, answered right here!\n* **[Bevy Assets](https://bevy.org/assets/):** A collection of awesome Bevy projects, tools, plugins and learning materials.\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor's Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.\nFor simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or\n[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!\n\nFor more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWe recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.\n\nFollow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.\nOnce set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)\ngit checkout latest\n# Runs the \"breakout\" example\ncargo run --example breakout\n```\n\nTo draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .run();\n}\n```\n\n### Fast Compiles\n\nBevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the \"fast compiles\" setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).\n\n## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]\n\nThis [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.\n\n[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md\n\n## Thanks\n\nBevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.\n\nA huge thanks to Bevy's [generous sponsors](https://bevy.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn't free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevy.org/donate/) if you like what we're building.\n\n<!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is.

You can see them [here](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryBuilds/releases).\n\nIf you'd rather compile on your own, follow these instructions.\nFirst, make sure you have [JDK 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=any&arch=any&version=17) installed. **Other JDK versions will not work.** Open a terminal in the Mindustry directory and run the following commands:\n\n### Windows\n\n_Running:_ `gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `gradlew desktop:dist`  \n_Sprite Packing:_ `gradlew tools:pack`\n\n### Linux/Mac OS\n\n_Running:_ `./gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `./gradlew desktop:dist`  \n_Sprite Packing:_ `./gradlew tools:pack`\n\n### Server\n\nServer builds are bundled with each released build (in Releases). If you'd rather compile on your own, replace 'desktop' with 'server', e.g. `gradlew server:dist`.\n\n### Android\n\n1. Install the Android SDK [here.](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools) Make sure you're downloading the \"Command line tools only\", as Android Studio is not required.\n2. In the unzipped Android SDK folder, find the cmdline-tools directory. Then create a folder inside of it called `latest` and put all of its contents into the newly created folder.\n3. In the same directory run the command `sdkmanager --licenses` (or `./sdkmanager --licenses` if on linux/mac)\n4. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to your unzipped Android SDK directory.\n5. Enable developer mode on your device/emulator. If you are on testing on a phone you can follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling), otherwise you need to google how to enable your emulator's developer mode specifically.\n6. Run `gradlew android:assembleDebug` (or `./gradlew` if on linux/mac). This will create an unsigned APK in `android/build/outputs/apk`.\n\nTo debug the application on a connected device/emulator, run `gradlew android:installDebug android:run`.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Permission Denied\n\nIf the terminal returns `Permission denied` or `Command not found` on Mac/Linux, run `chmod +x ./gradlew` before running `./gradlew`. *This is a one-time procedure.*\n\n#### Where is the `mindustry.gen` package?\n\nAs the name implies, `mindustry.gen` is generated *at build time* based on other code. You will not find source code for this package in the repository, and it should not be edited by hand.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of the \"source\" of generated code in `mindustry.gen`:\n\n- `Call`, `*Packet` classes: Generated from methods marked with `@Remote`.\n- All entity classes (`Unit`, `EffectState`, `Posc`, etc): Generated from component classes in the `mindustry.entities.comp` package, and combined using definitions in `mindustry.content.UnitTypes`.\n- `Sounds`, `Musics`, `Tex`, `Icon`, etc: Generated based on files in the respective asset folders.\n\n---\n\nGradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. <br>\nAfter building, the output .JAR file should be in `/desktop/build/libs/Mindustry.jar` for desktop builds, and in `/server/build/libs/server-release.jar` for server builds.\n\n## Feature Requests\n\nPost feature requests and feedback [here](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Downloads\n\n| [![](https://static.itch.io/images/badge.svg)](https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry)    |    [![](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en-play-badge.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.anuke.mindustry)   |    [![](https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png)](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.anuke.mindustry)\t| [![](https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.svg)](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.Anuken.Mindustry)  \n|---\t|---\t|---\t|---\t|\n",

This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest\nenvironment consistent with the production live trading environment.\n\nNautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the\nhighest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting\nand live deployment workloads.\n\nThe platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular\nadapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types\nincluding FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.\n\n![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png \"nautilus-trader\")\n\n## Features\n\n- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).\n- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.\n- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.\n- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.\n- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.\n- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).\n- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.\n- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.\n- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.\n- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).\n\n![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png \"nautilus\")\n\n> *nautilus - from ancient Greek 'sailor' and naus 'ship'.*\n>\n> *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.\n> The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*\n\n## Why NautilusTrader?\n\n- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.\n- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.\n- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.\n- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.\n\nTraditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python\nusing vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way\nusing C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot\nexpress the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have\nproven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.\n\nOne of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform\nhave all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).\nThis means we're using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,\nwith CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.\n\n## Why Python?\n\nPython was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.\nIt has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.\nBased on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.\nNot only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\n\n## Why Rust?\n\n[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe\nconcurrency. Rust is \"blazingly fast\" and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.\nIt can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.\n\nRust's rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code,\neliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on\ncorrectly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.\n\nThe project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.\n\nThis project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):\n\n> “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.\n> The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.\n> As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.\n\n## Integrations\n\nNautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues\nand data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.\n\nThe following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:\n\n| Name                                                                         | ID                    | Type

adapter clients.\n- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).\n\n### Status\n\n- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.\n- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.\n- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).\n\nSee the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) documentation for further details.\n\n## Versioning and releases\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while\n> the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.\n> We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.\n\nWe aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.\n\n### Branches\n\nWe aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.\n\n- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.\n- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.\n- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).\n> Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.\n> This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.\n\n## Precision mode\n\nNautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),\nwhich differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.\n\n- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.\n- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.\n> On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.\n> For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.\n\n**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nnautilus_model = { version = \"*\", features = [\"high-precision\"] }\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nWe recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n\n**There are two supported ways to install**:\n\n1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.\n2. Build from source.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a \"vanilla\" CPython.\n>\n> Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.\n\n### From PyPI\n\nTo install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python's pip package manager:\n\n```bash\npip install -U nautilus_trader\n```\n\nInstall optional dependencies as 'extras' for specific integrations (e.g., `betfair`, `docker`, `dydx`, `ib`, `polymarket`, `visualization`):\n\n```bash\npip install -U \"nautilus_trader[docker,ib]\"\n```\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras) for the full list of available extras.\n\n### From the Nautech Systems package index\n\nThe Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.\nThis enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.\n\n#### Stable wheels\n\nStable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.\n\nTo install the latest stable release:\n\n```bash\npip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:\n\n#### Development wheels\n\nDevelopment wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,\nallowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.\n\nThis process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,\nwhile adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:\n\n- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).\n- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).\n\n| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |\n| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |\n| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |\n| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |\n| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |\n| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |\n\n**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.\nSkipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.\n\n#### Installation commands\n\nBy default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.\n\nTo install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):\n\n```bash\npip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n```\n\nTo install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.221.0a20251026` for October 26, 2025):\n\n```bash\npip install nautilus_trader==1.221.0a20251026 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n```\n\n#### Available versions\n\nYou can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).\n\nTo programmatically fetch and list available versions:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP '(?<=<a href=\")[^\"]+(?=\")' | awk -F'#' '{print $1}' | sort\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> On Linux, confirm your glibc version with `ldd --version` and ensure it reports **2.35** or newer before installing binary wheels.\n\n#### Branch updates\n\n- `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): Build and publish continuously with every merged commit.\n- `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): Build and publish daily when we automatically merge the `develop` branch at **14:00 UTC** (if there are changes).\n\n#### Retention policies\n\n- `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): We retain only the most recent wheel build.\n- `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): We retain only the 30 most recent wheel builds.\n\n#### Verifying build provenance\n\nAll release artifacts (wheels and source distributions) published to PyPI, GitHub Releases,\nand the Nautech Systems package index include cryptographic attestations that prove their authenticity and build provenance.\n\nThese attestations are generated automatically during the CI/CD pipeline using [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) build provenance, and can be verified to ensure:\n\n- The artifact was built by the official NautilusTrader GitHub Actions workflow.\n- The artifact corresponds to a specific commit SHA in the repository.\n- The artifact hasn't been tampered with since it was built.\n\nTo verify a wheel file using the GitHub CLI:\n\n```bash\ngh attestation verify nautilus_trader-1.220.0-*.whl --owner nautechsystems\n```\n\nThis provides supply chain security by allowing you to cryptographically verify that the installed package came from the official NautilusTrader build process.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Attestation verification requires the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) to be installed.\n> Development wheels from `develop` and `nightly` branches are also attested and can be verified the same way.\n\n### From source\n\nIt's possible to install from source using pip if you first install the build dependencies as specified in the `pyproject.toml`.\n\n1. Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (the Rust toolchain installer):\n   - Linux and macOS:\n\n       ```bash\n       curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n       ```\n\n   - Windows:\n       - Download and install [`rustup-init.exe`](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64)\n       - Install \"Desktop development with C++\" using [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)\n   - Verify (any system):\n       from a terminal session run: `rustc --version`\n\n2. Enable `cargo` in the current shell:\n   - Linux and macOS:\n\n       ```bash\n       source $HOME/.cargo/env\n       ```\n\n   - Windows:\n     - Start a new PowerShell\n\n3. Install [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) (a C language frontend for LLVM):\n   - Linux:\n\n       ```bash\n       sudo apt-get install clang\n       ```\n\n   - Windows:\n       1. Add Clang to your [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/):\n          - Start | Visual Studio Installer | Modify | C++ Clang tools for Windows (latest) = checked | Modify\n       2. Enable `clang` in the current shell:\n\n          ```powershell\n          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('path', \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\BuildTools\\VC\\Tools\\Llvm\\x64\\bin\\;\" + $env:Path,\"User\")\n          ```\n\n   - Verify (any system):\n       from a terminal session run: `clang --version`\n\n4. Install uv (see the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) for more details):\n\n    - Linux and macOS:\n\n        ```bash\n        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n        ```\n\n    - Windows (PowerShell):\n\n        ```powershell\n        irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\n        ```\n\n5. Clone the source with `git`, and install from the project's root directory:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone --branch develop --depth 1 https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader\n    cd nautilus_trader\n    uv sync --all-extras\n    ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> The `--depth 1` flag fetches just the latest commit for a faster, lightweight clone.\n\n6. Set environment variables for PyO3 compilation (Linux and macOS only):\n\n    ```bash\n    # Linux only: Set the library path for the Python interpreter\n    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$(python -c 'import sys; print(sys.base_prefix)')/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\n\n    # Set the Python executable path for PyO3\n    export PYO3_PYTHON=$(pwd)/.venv/bin/python\n\n    # Required for Rust tests when using uv-installed Python\n    export PYTHONHOME=$(python -c \"import sys; print(sys.base_prefix)\")\n    ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` export is Linux-specific and not needed on macOS.\n>\n> The `PYTHONHOME` variable is required when running `make cargo-test` with a `uv`-installed Python.\n> Without it, tests that depend on PyO3 may fail to locate the Python runtime.\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for other options and further details.\n\n## Redis\n\nUsing [Redis](https://redis.io) with NautilusTrader is **optional** and only required if configured as the backend for a\n[cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) database or [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).\nSee the **Redis** section of the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#redis) for further details.\n\n## Makefile\n\nA `Makefile` is provided to automate most installation and build tasks for development. Some of the targets include:\n\n- `make install`: Installs in `release` build mode with all dependency groups and extras.\n- `make install-debug`: Same as `make install` but with `debug` build mode.\n- `make install-just-deps`: Installs just the `main`, `dev` and `test` dependencies (does not install package).\n- `make build`: Runs the build script in `release` build mode (default).\n- `make build-debug`: Runs the build script in `debug` build mode.\n- `make build-wheel`: Runs uv build with a wheel format in `release` mode.\n- `make build-wheel-debug`: Runs uv build with a wheel format in `debug` mode.\n- `make cargo-test`: Runs all Rust crate tests using `cargo-nextest`.\n- `make clean`: Deletes all build results, such as `.so` or `.dll` files.\n- `make distclean`: **CAUTION** Removes all artifacts not in the git index from the repository. This includes source files which have not been `git add`ed.\n- `make docs`: Builds the documentation HTML using Sphinx.\n- `make pre-commit`: Runs the pre-commit checks over all files.\n- `make ruff`: Runs ruff over all files using the `pyproject.toml` config (with autofix).\n- `make pytest`: Runs all tests with `pytest`.\n- `make test-performance`: Runs performance tests with [codspeed](https://codspeed.io).\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Run `make help` for documentation on all available make targets.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> See the [crates/infrastructure/TESTS.md](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/blob/develop/crates/infrastructure/TESTS.md) file for running the infrastructure integration tests.\n\n## Examples\n\nIndicators and strategies can be developed in both Python and Cython. For performance and\nlatency-sensitive applications, we recommend using Cython. Below are some examples:\n\n- [indicator](/nautilus_trader/examples/indicators/ema_python.py) example written in Python.\n- [indicator](/nautilus_trader/indicators/) implementations written in Cython.\n- [strategy](/nautilus_trader/examples/strategies/) examples written in Python.\n- [backtest](/examples/backtest/) examples using a `BacktestEngine` directly.\n\n## Docker\n\nDocker containers are built using the base image `python:3.12-slim` with the following variant tags:\n\n- `nautilus_trader:latest` has the latest release version installed.\n- `nautilus_trader:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed.\n- `jupyterlab:latest` has the latest release version installed along with `jupyterlab` and an\n  example backtest notebook with accompanying data.\n- `jupyterlab:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed along with `jupyterlab` and an\n  example backtest notebook with accompanying data.\n\nYou can pull the container images as follows:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/<image_variant_tag> --platform linux/amd64\n```\n\nYou can launch the backtest example container by running:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:nightly --platform linux/amd64\ndocker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:nightly\n```\n\nThen open your browser at the following address:\n\n```bash\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8888/lab\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> NautilusTrader currently exceeds the rate limit for Jupyter notebook logging (stdout output).\n> Therefore, we set the `log_level` to `ERROR` in the examples. Lowering this level to see more\n> logging will cause the notebook to hang during cell execution. We are investigating a fix that\n> may involve either raising the configured rate limits for Jupyter or throttling the log flushing\n> from Nautilus.\n>\n> - <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/12845>\n> - <https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-limit-output>\n\n## Development\n\nWe aim to provide the most pleasant developer experience possible for this hybrid codebase of Python, Cython and Rust.\nSee the [Developer Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/developer_guide/) for helpful information.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Run `make build-debug` to compile after changes to Rust or Cython code for the most efficient development workflow.\n\n### Testing with Rust\n\n[cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st) is the standard Rust test runner for NautilusTrader.\nIts key benefit is isolating each test in its own process, ensuring test reliability\nby avoiding interference.\n\nYou can install cargo-nextest by running:\n\n```bash\ncargo install cargo-nextest\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Run Rust tests with `make cargo-test`, which uses **cargo-nextest** with an efficient profile.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for considering contributing to NautilusTrader!

      "readme": "# Important announcement about the app\r\n\r\nMy development environment was infected by unknown malicious software, as a result of which a few builds may have been affected. Once the issue was detected, I secured everything with a full disk wipe, restored a clean setup, and now all builds are scanned with VirusTotal. The F-Droid version will also be verified before release.\r\n\r\nPublic keys may have been compromised, which is why I am sharing this issue. You can download the new version and the new public key below, and instructions for restoring backups are provided.\r\n\r\nNo extra actions are required since the app uses **one-time connection codes**. These codes have very limited permissions (for example, they cannot change your password). Still, you can revoke them if you want full peace of mind.\r\n\r\n# How to revoke access:\r\n\r\n1. Open [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)\r\n2. Find **“Your connections to third-party apps & services”**\r\n3. Tap **“See all connection”** and locate **YouTube TV** or **Google Drive**\r\n4. Select the app → **“Remove access”**\r\n\r\nPlease keep built-in security features enabled to stay protected.\r\n\r\n# SmartTube\r\n  \r\n<!-- <img width=\"100\" src=\"https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/blob/master/smarttubetv/src/ststable/res/mipmap-nodpi/app_icon.png\" alt=\"logo\"/> -->\r\n\r\n![The app screenshot](./images/browse_home.png)\r\n\r\nSmartTube is a free and open-source advanced media player for Android TVs and TV boxes. It allows you to play content from various public sources.\r\n\r\n### ✅ Features\r\n- No ads  \r\n- SponsorBlock integration  \r\n- Adjustable playback speed  \r\n- 8K resolution support  \r\n- 60fps playback  \r\n- HDR compatibility  \r\n- View live chat  \r\n- Customizable buttons  \r\n- Does not require Google Services  \r\n- Helpful international community\r\n\r\n### ❌ Limitations\r\n- Not supported on phones and tablets  \r\n- Comment functionality is unstable  \r\n- Voice search and casting performance may be inferior to official apps, depending on your device  \r\n\r\nGive it a try!\r\n\r\n**Do you have any question?** Ctrl+F or ⌘F this readme first!\r\n\r\n[**Installation**](#installation) | [**Official Site**](https://smarttubeapp.github.io) | [**Donation**](#donation) | [**FAQ**](#faq) | [Support / Chat](#support) | [Build](#build) | [Translate the app](https://jtbrinkmann.de/tools/android-strings.xml-translator.html) | [Changelog](https://t.me/s/SmartTubeNewsEN) | [Liability](#liability)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Device support\r\n\r\n![Device support image](images/new/upload_f6ab10668ea7793f099108f2b2230406.png)\r\n* **Supported:** all Android TVs and TV boxes (incl. FireTV, NVIDIA Shield & Google Chromecast with Google TV), even older ones with Android 4.3 (Kitkat).\r\n* **Not supported:** Smartphones, non-Android platforms like Samsung Tizen, LG webOS, iOS, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n> [video of the installation](images/new/zPV0imF.mp4) (note: download url changed to `kutt.it/stn_beta` or `kutt.it/stn_stable`)\r\n\r\n**Do not** download SmartTube from any **app store**, APK websites or blogs; these were uploaded by other people and may contain malware or ads. SmartTube is not officially published on any app store. Sadly, the Google PlayStore does not allow ad-free Youtube apps using unofficial APIs.\r\n\r\nThere is a **beta release** (recommended) and a **stable release**. Beta gets new features and bugfixes faster than the stable release.\r\n\r\nYou can use either of the following methods to install the app:\r\n\r\n- (**Easiest**) Install [Downloader by AFTVnews](https://www.aftvnews.com/downloader/) on your Android TV, open it and enter `kutt.it/stn_beta` or `kutt.it/stn_stable`, then read, understand and confirm the security prompts. (<small>You can also enter [**79015**](https://aftv.news/79015) (for beta) or [**28544**](https://aftv.news/28544) (for stable), but this requires an extra step to install the AFTVnews Downloader browser addon if you haven't already.</small>)\r\n- Install a file transfer app on your Android TV, download the APK on your phone or computer and transfer it to your TV (e.g. [_Send Files to TV_](https://sendfilestotv.app/) from the Google Play Store / Amazon AppStore)\r\n- Download the APK onto a USB stick, put the USB stick into your TV and use a file manager app from the Google Play Store / Amazon AppStore (e.g. [_FX File Explorer_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx) or [_X-plore_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore)). Android's preinstalled file manager does not work! Do **not** get the ad-infested _FileCommander_.\r\n- If you are an advanced user, you can install it using ADB. [guide](https://fossbytes.com/side-load-apps-android-tv/#h-how-to-sideload-apps-on-your-android-tv-using-adb) | [alternative guide](https://www.aftvnews.com/sideload/)\r\n\r\n**Troubleshooting:** See device specific notes below. If installation fails, either your **disk space is full** or the APK file didn't download correctly; clear up space and try downloading again. If the app installed, but crashes when opening, make sure to install it to internal memory, not to an SD card / external storage.\r\n\r\n**The app has a built-in updater** with changelog. You can also find all releases and the **changelog** on the [Telegram channel @SmartTubeNewsEN](https://t.me/s/SmartTubeNewsEN) (readable without account) or on [Github](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/releases/).\r\n\r\n> latest [**beta download**](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/releases/download/latest/smarttube_beta.apk)\r\n>\r\n> latest [stable download](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/releases/download/latest/smarttube_stable.apk)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation (Chromecast with Google TV)\r\n\r\nOn **Chromecast with Google TV**, installation of apps is blocked by default, so an extra step is required:\r\n\r\n> **4.1. Enable Developer Options**\r\n>\r\n> On your Chromecast, open the side menu and go to _Settings > System > About_. Scroll down to the _Android TV OS build_ section and click that repeatedly. A toast message will appear, explaining that you are a few steps away from being a developer. Continue clicking until you trigger it.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> **4.2. Turn on the \"unknown sources\" setting**\r\n>\r\n> Go back to the main _Settings_ page and select _Apps > Security & Restrictions > Unknown sources_. Turn on the toggle for \\[_Downloader by AFTVnews_ or\\] whichever file browser you decided to use [...].\r\n>\r\n> [[source & picture guide](https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/07/how-to-sideload-any-apk-on-the-chromecast-with-android-tv/#install-the-apk)]\r\n\r\nAfter this, you can follow the [general installation guide](#installation) above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation (Xiaomi devices with Chinese firmware)\r\n\r\nXiaomi's **Chinese firmware** might block the installation **of the beta version**. The international firmware is not affected. Solutions:\r\n1. Use SmartTube's **stable version** instead (**recommended**)\r\n2. Use the international firmware for your device\r\n3. (if your device is from 2020 or before) You can do a factory reset and then install SmartTube beta before doing any system updates. You can then safely update your system, SmartTube should continue working.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Updating\r\n\r\nThe app has a built-in updater. You only need to follow the installation procedure **once**. A few seconds after launching SmartTube, it will notify you if there is any update and also show a changelog. You can disable automatic update checks or manually update in the settings under \"about\".\r\n\r\nIf the installation fails, either your **disk space is full** or the update didn't download correctly; clear up space and try updating again (_Settings > About > Check for updates_).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nSmartTube requires Android 4.3 or above. It does not work on non-Android devices (incl. LG or Samsung TVs). On unsupported TVs, you can use a TV stick or TV box. Though this app technically runs on smartphones and tablets, it is not optimized for such and offers no official support!\r\n\r\nIt has been successfully tested on TVs, TV boxes and TV sticks that are based on Android, including:\r\n\r\n- Android TVs & Google TVs (e.g. Philips, Sony)\r\n- Chromecast with Google TV & TVs with _Chromecast built-in_\r\n- Amazon FireTV stick (all generations)\r\n- NVIDIA Shield\r\n- TV boxes running Android (many cheap chinese no-name boxes)\r\n- Xiaomi Mi Box\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Adblocking\r\n\r\nSmartTube does not show any ad banners, preroll ads or ad intermissions. It not just tries to prevent them, it is literally programmed to be completely **unable** to display any ads, so YouTube cannot slip anything in. This also means you cannot allow ads or whitelist channels. Some YouTube channels include sponsored messages in their videos, these can also be skipped, see [SponsorBlock](#SponsorBlock) below.\r\n\r\n\r\n### SponsorBlock\r\n\r\nSmartTube includes a SponsorBlock integration. From the [SponsorBlock website](https://sponsor.ajay.app/):\r\n\r\n> SponsorBlock is an open-source crowdsourced browser extension and open API for **skipping sponsor segments** in YouTube videos. [...] the extension automatically skips sponsors **it knows about** using a privacy preserving query system. It also supports skipping **other categories**, such as intros, outros and reminders to subscribe [and non-music parts in music videos].\r\n\r\nYou can select which categories you want to skip in the settings. Unlike the browser addon, in SmartTube you cannot submit new segments (TVs and TV remotes aren't great devices for such precise operations). Note that SponsorBlock is a free and voluntary project based on user submissions, so don't expect it to 100% work every time. Sometimes, sponsor segments are not yet submitted to the database, sometimes the SponsorBlock servers are offline/overloaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Casting\r\n\r\nTo cast videos from your phone (or other devices), you must link that device to your TV. Unlike the original YouTube app, SmartTube does not automatically show up when you are in the same wifi network. How to link your smartphone and TV:\r\n\r\n1. open SmartTube and go to settings\r\n2. go to \"Remote control\" (2nd option)\r\n3. open your YouTube app on your phone, go to settings > General > watch on TV\r\n4. click on _connect using TV-code_ and enter the code from your TV\r\n\r\n[**Screenshot guide**](https://t.me/SmartTubeEN/8514)\r\n\r\nDue to technical limitations, you need to open the app on the TV before casting; SmartTube cannot automatically wake up the TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Picture-in-Picture (PiP)\r\n\r\nSmartTube supports playing videos in PiP mode. This needs to be enabled under _Settings > General > Background playback > Picture in picture_. The video will go into PiP mode when you press home while playing a video, and also when you press _back_ if enabled in _Settings > General > Background playback (activation)_.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Adjust Speed\r\n\r\nYou can adjust the playback speed pressing the speed-indicator icon (gauge) in the top row of the player. This is remembered across videos. Some speeds may case frame drops, this is a known issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Voice Search\r\n\r\nTo enable global voice search, an additional app must be installed alongside SmartTube. This _bridge app_ can intercept the System's attempts to open the original YouTube app and open SmartTube instead. For this to work, you must uninstall the original YouTube app. We know this sucks, but you can always reinstall it if you change your mind. The _bridge app_ will not show up in your launcher and you cannot launch it directly; it is only used internally by the system's voice search. On some devices, you need to explicitly say \"Youtube\" when searching (e.g. say \"youtube cute cats\" instead of just \"cute cats\").\r\n\r\n**On Amazon Fire TV**: \r\n\r\n1. Uninstall the original YouTube app (no root required)\r\n2. Download and install the Amazon Bridge SmartTube app: https://kutt.it/stn_bridge_amazon (e.g. via _Downloader by AFTVnews_)\r\n\r\n\r\n**On Google Chromecast with Google TV**: \r\n\r\n1. Uninstall the original YouTube app (no root required)\r\n2.

This is an open source, hobby project. Several others have helped with translations, some of which can be seen on [Github](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/graphs/contributors), some have sent their translations directly to Yurii. There are also helpful people in the support chat.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n    \r\n**NOTE: OpenJDK 14 or older (!) is required. Newer JDK could cause app crash!**  \r\nTo build and install debug version, run these commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube.git\r\ncd SmartTube\r\ngit submodule update --init\r\nadb connect <device_ip_address>\r\ngradlew clean installStstableDebug\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Video codecs\r\n\r\nVideo codecs are the algorithms used for video compression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which codec to choose / overview\r\n\r\n|          | recommendation                               | hardware support             | compression, bitrate\\*              | quality |\r\n|:--------:|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------- |:----------------------:|:-------:|\r\n| **AV01** aka. AV1 | best choice, **if your device supports** | first devices started coming in **2020**   | **best** <small>(e.g. 1.6 Mbps)</small>   | same   |\r\n| **VP9**  | **best choice on most devices**         | most devices **since 2015** | **better** <small>(e.g. 2.1 Mbps)</small> | same   |\r\n| AVC  | only for old or slow hardware | **all** devices             | good <small>(e.g. 2.7 Mbps)</small>   | same   |\r\n\r\n\r\n<small>\\* Examples taken from the video-only track at 1080p @ 25fps for this video: [Dua Lipa - New Rules (Official Music Video)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=k2qgadSvNyU)</small>\r\n\r\nAt the same resolution, a **lower bitrate is better!** YouTube explicitly targets the **same quality** regardless of the codec. Older codecs have a higher bitrate only because they are less efficient. On Youtube, you **do not** get better quality by simply choosing a higher bitrate. Newer codecs have a better compression = lower bitrate = use less bandwidth = save the environment. This is a feature, not a bug. You should use the newest codec that works smoothly on your device, not the least efficient one. AVC usually has the highest bitrate. This is bad, not good.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which quality to choose?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no automatic mode based on your bandwidth. But you can configure a default video preset yourself under settings \\> video player \\> video presets. The first option (\"none\") will remember your last selection within the video player. Any other preset is used initially for each video; if the selected profile is not available, the next best available option is used. You can still override the profile on each video individually within the player.\r\n\r\nTo decide the optional resolution / video quality for you, you need to consider a few limiting factors:\r\n- Your bandwidth (choose only up to the bitrate that your bandwidth can handle; you can do a speedtest using [fast.com](https://fast.com) by Netflix)\r\n- Your TV's display resolution (the quality **might slightly** improve, if you select the next higher resolution, e.g. 1080p on a 720p display; but don't expect a big difference)\r\n- Your TV's capabilities (e.g. HDR, 60fps)\r\n\r\nGenerally 60fps is an improvement, but if you personally don't notice (or mind) the difference, you can save bandwidth (and the environment) by not choosing 60fps.\r\n\r\n\r\n### HDR\r\n\r\nHDR works only **if your hardware supports it**. It's a complicated mess:\r\n- Your TV must support it\r\n- If you use a TV box, that TV box **and** your TV cable **and** the TV must support HDR\r\n- Yes, there truly are different HDMI cable versions with different HDR-support, it's complicated\r\n- some devices (like the **NVIDIA Shield**) generally support HDR, but **not** the specific HDR format that is used on YouTube :cry:\r\n \r\nIf HDR videos look looked dim or washed out, then check [this article](https://www.wired.com/story/hdr-too-dark-how-to-fix-it/). **If HDR is not working**, it's probably not this app's fault. You might need to search on the web for \"HDR\" and your device name for any help.\r\n\r\n## Liability\r\n\r\nWe take no responsibility for the use of our tool, or external instances\r\nprovided by third parties.

You can set-up such DNS either automatically or manually. To automatic set-up you can use the [Intra apk at fdroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.intra/) and the [\"AutoStart - No root\"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autostart) apk to make it autolaunch after every TV restart. For manual set-up [use this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiBox/s/7esEVGtAAa).\r\n\r\n### Q: There is no result for the search that I say (Android 11)\r\n\r\nA: They're some reports that the latest update for \"Google app for Android TV\" could cause this bug. Deleting the update should fix the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: AV01 does not play / Why is VP9 slow on my device?\r\n\r\nA: Because AV01 is very new, **most** TVs and TV boxes **do not** offer hardware support and **cannot** play AV01 **at all**.\r\n\r\nIf your device has hardware support for a codec, videos using that codec should play smoothly. High resolutions might also be slow in VP9 on cheap TV boxes that don't officially support 4k. Your device probably can play VP9 videos even without hardware support, however this requires a powerful CPU to run smoothly. Fixing AV01 without hardware support is technically possible, but currently not planned and probably not efficient enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can you make SmartTube look like the original app?\r\n\r\nA: Compared to SmartTube's UI, Stock Youtube and YT Kids are far ahead. However, we'd need someone who's skilled and willing to dedicate enough time and energy into making it. And into maintaining it longterm (incl. new features, bug fixes). All of this for free. If you are / got someone like that, please help.\r\nNot to mention that SmartTube follows Google's official template & recommendations for Android TV apps. It's Google's fault that the template is somewhat ugly. 😂\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can the search page be improved?\r\n\r\nA: It can be, but it takes someone to do it, similar to the above FAQ-entry. SmartTube is following Google's officially recommended design/template for TV apps and is using the official, preinstalled Android TV keyboard. Sadly, Google did a really bad job regarding the search page and keyboard. Maybe a future SmartTube update can add an embedded keyboard, similar to the original YouTube or other major Android TV apps. Maybe it can improve the looks to be as good or better than in the official YouTube app. But for now, it is the way it is due to lack of time and due to Google's official recommendations being bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I install this on a Samsung Tizen TV / LG webOS TV / Roku / iOS / toaster?\r\n\r\nA: No, this only works on **Android** devices. If you look at an Android TV's product page, it usually says clearly that it's based on Android. The app **cannot** easily be ported over to other plattforms and we have no plans to even try. **Please do not ask**. Instead, you can connect a separate TV stick or TV box to your TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I install this on a smartphone? / Can you add portrait mode? / Scrolling doesn't work.\r\n\r\nA: **Big No**. This app is **not** for smartphones, we offer **zero support** for that.\r\n\r\nYou **can cast** videos **from** your smartphone to a TV / TV box running SmartTube, though. Just use the official YouTube app or [ReVanced](https://github.com/ReVanced), see [the casting section](#casting) for more information.\r\n\r\n**There will not be a phone version.** You can use [ReVanced](https://github.com/ReVanced), [Pure Tuber](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.tube.premium.advanced.tuber), [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org), or [NewPipe x SponsorBlock](https://github.com/polymorphicshade/NewPipe#newpipe-x-sponsorblock) instead. Please go to their respective support chats for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I install this on a tablet / car screen / smartphone with docking station?\r\n\r\nYes... maybe.. Requirements:\r\n\r\n- It is an Android device\r\n- It has a large screen\r\n- It has a TV remote, controller, or keyboard\r\n  **Touch input is not supported.** Mouse/touchpad scrolling neither. You cannot properly use SmartTube with only touch or mouse input.\r\n\r\nSome users reported great success (incl. on a [car entertainment system](https://t.me/SmartTubeEN/6060)). **Please share your success stories with us.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: I get \"unknown codec\" / \"can't download video\" errors\r\n\r\nA: please wait 5 seconds for the video to play. If that doesn't help, press the play button. Some users reported, that this issue only appears when they have a USB audio device attached or if their disk storage is full.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: I get \"the video profile is not supported\"\r\n\r\nA. Press the \"HQ\"-button in the bottom-left, select _video formats_ and select anything other than AV01. AV01 is **not supported** on most devices (apparently including yours), so select VP9 instead. See [the section on video codecs](#Video-codecs) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: I get \"video unavailable\" when watching unlisted videos / my own videos\r\n\r\nA: Right, that's currently a bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: It doesn't show up on my casting list\r\n\r\nA: Please read the [Casting](#casting) section.\r\n\r\n### Q: I get an error saying \"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot\"\r\n\r\nA: Your IP address range might be temporaily/permanently blocked by YouTube from watching videos if you not signed in to your account.\r\n\r\n### Q: The video is buffering a lot\r\n\r\nA: The issue might not be specific to SmartTube, as other unofficial YouTube apps also report this issue. It seems uncommon nowadays, but was very present in the 2nd quarter of 2021. Some users or devices seem to be more affected then others. The official YouTube app & website are apparently only rarely affected. The root cause of the issue is currently unclear, but it appears to be a server-side thing on YouTube's end. Possibly, YouTube is discriminating 3rd party apps.\r\n\r\nFor now, try to see if it helps to:\r\n\r\n- Reduce the resolution (or chance it back)\r\n- Change the video format to AVC\r\n- Increase the buffer in the settings\r\n- Hit the back button and try playing the video again\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: The debug information says my display is 1080p, but I have a 4k/UHD display!\r\n\r\nA: Do not worry, **the debug information is incorrect.** SmartTube works fine even above 1080p and you should be able to see that, when you play a video in 4k or UHD.\r\nAlso do not worry if it says \"720p\" and you have a 1080p display.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Why does it not autoselect highest quality?\r\n\r\nA: **It does** (by default). If you set a _video profile_ under settings, that acts as a maximum for automatic selection. Check if you configured a video profile, you can unset it by choosing \"none\".\r\n\r\n**Please do not confuse quality with bitrate**. See [the section on video codecs](#Video-codecs) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I set a (maximum) resolution by default?\r\n\r\nA: SmartTube automatically select the highest available quality for your video, up to a maximum resolution that you can set in the settings under \"video profile\". If available, SmartTube will pick the selected video profile, or otherwise the next best one available will be used. You can still always change the video profile while watching videos.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can it set the resolution to \"auto\", depending on my available bandwidth?\r\n\r\nA: This is planned, but not available yet (sorry 🙇‍♀️). However, you can set a maximum resolution to something that should work for your bandwidth. See above for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Why does it skip video segments?\r\n\r\nA: SmartTube has a feature called **SponsorBlock**. You can select categories should be skipped, if any. See the [SponsorBlock section](#sponsorblock) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: How to start the next video automatically / stop after every video?\r\n\r\nA: You can switch between different autoplay-modes using the loop-button 🔁\r\n\r\n[![screenshot showing the loop-button](images/new/V3GHGvWprmdE1w.jpg)](https://t.me/SmartTubeEN/24953)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: How to remove recommended videos (e.g. news) that are unrelated to me?\r\n\r\nA: Recommended videos are defined by YouTube and not by the app, we cannot change the algorithm. They are based on your country, which you can change in the settings. If you are logged in, they are based on your watch history, user profile data, and whatever else Google might use. If you are not logged in, you are like in \"incognito mode\", so your watch history does not influence your recommendations. Maybe a future version will add optional user profiling without logging in.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Does HDR work?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, HDR works **if your hardware** supports it. The **NVIDIA Shield** does not. See [the section on HDR](#HDR) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Why do some updates say \"don't update if satisfied with the current version\" in the changelog?\r\n\r\nA: These updates change a lot of code, trying to fix bugs that only affect a few users/devices. Only the affected users should update. For anyone else, there is nothing to gain from updating; however there is the chance of causing new bugs. Do not worry if you updated anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: When playing at other speeds, frames are skipped!\r\n\r\nA: We currently cannot fix this, sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: What is AFR?\r\n\r\nA: \"Auto Frame Rate\". It adjusts the refresh rate of your TV to match the content you're watching. It can slightly improve the smoothness, but the difference is very small; most people barely notice it. It does not work well on every hardware. If you don't know what it does and don't want to test it out yourself, you can safely keep it off.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation:** You can turn it on to see if it works on your device; if it causes issues (or if you don't care to test), turn it **off**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Should I choose high or low buffer?\r\n\r\nA: The higher your buffer, the more of a video will be preloaded ahead of your current position. A low buffer might minimally reduce your bandwidth usage, if you often close videos before they end. A high buffer can smooth out network issues and prevent the video from pausing to buffer. A higher buffer increases RAM usage, however this shouldn't be an issue.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation: high**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I retain the buffer when seeking back?\r\n\r\nA: No, when you seek back (e.g. jump back 5 seconds), SmartTube will have to rebuffer. This might be improved in a future update.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: My device freezes when watching YouTube\r\n\r\nA: That's a firmware or Android issue. If you are using a custom rom, maybe that rom is buggy. Because this issue is nearly impossible for the developer to debug, we cannot help you, sorry. You can try the usual workarounds: rebooting, clearing cache, reinstalling the app, or factory resetting the device.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I download videos?\r\n\r\nA: Not with SmartTube\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can updates be installed automatically?\r\n\r\nA: No, this is technically not possible. Only the preinstalled app manager (usually Google PlayStore, Amazon AppStore, etc) has the required permission. All other apps, incl. SmartTube can only show open installation prompt. A workaround using root would be possible, but hasn't been implemented yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I whitelist ads on some channels?\r\n\r\nA: No, this is not possible. SmartTube does not have any code to display ads. Adding this functionality would actually take time and effort, which is instead spent on adding useful features and fixing bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It exposes numerous tools from core Ghidra functionality to MCP clients.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36080514-f227-44bd-af84-78e29ee1d7f9\n\n\n# Features\nMCP Server + Ghidra Plugin\n\n- Decompile and analyze binaries in Ghidra\n- Automatically rename methods and data\n- List methods, classes, imports, and exports\n\n# Installation\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Install [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org)\n- Python3\n- MCP [SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)\n\n## Ghidra\nFirst, download the latest [release](https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP/releases) from this repository. This contains the Ghidra plugin and Python MCP client. Then, you can directly import the plugin into Ghidra.\n\n1. Run Ghidra\n2. Select `File` -> `Install Extensions`\n3. Click the `+` button\n4. Select the `GhidraMCP-1-2.zip` (or your chosen version) from the downloaded release\n5. Restart Ghidra\n6. Make sure the GhidraMCPPlugin is enabled in `File` -> `Configure` -> `Developer`\n7. *Optional*: Configure the port in Ghidra with `Edit` -> `Tool Options` -> `GhidraMCP HTTP Server`\n\nVideo Installation Guide:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75f0c176-6da1-48dc-ad96-c182eb4648c3\n\n\n\n## MCP Clients\n\nTheoretically, any MCP client should work with ghidraMCP.  Three examples are given below.\n\n## Example 1: Claude Desktop\nTo set up Claude Desktop as a Ghidra MCP client, go to `Claude` -> `Settings` -> `Developer` -> `Edit Config` -> `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"ghidra\": {\n      \"command\": \"python\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py\",\n        \"--ghidra-server\",\n        \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, edit this file directly:\n```\n/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\nThe server IP and port are configurable and should be set to point to the target Ghidra instance. If not set, both will default to localhost:8080.\n\n## Example 2: Cline\nTo use GhidraMCP with [Cline](https://cline.bot), this requires manually running the MCP server as well. First run the following command:\n\n```\npython bridge_mcp_ghidra.py --transport sse --mcp-host 127.0.0.1 --mcp-port 8081 --ghidra-server http://127.0.0.1:8080/\n```\n\nThe only *required* argument is the transport. If all other arguments are unspecified, they will default to the above. Once the MCP server is running, open up Cline and select `MCP Servers` at the top.\n\n![Cline select](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88e1f336-4729-46ee-9b81-53271e9c0ce0)\n\nThen select `Remote Servers` and add the following, ensuring that the url matches the MCP host and port:\n\n1. Server Name: GhidraMCP\n2. Server URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8081/sse`\n\n## Example 3: 5ire\nAnother MCP client that supports multiple models on the backend is [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire). To set up GhidraMCP, open 5ire and go to `Tools` -> `New` and set the following configurations:\n\n1. Tool Key: ghidra\n2. Name: GhidraMCP\n3. Command: `python /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py`\n\n# Building from Source\n1.

      "readme": "= Elasticsearch\n\nElasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store and vector database optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Elasticsearch is the foundation of Elastic's open Stack platform. Search in near real-time over massive datasets, perform vector searches, integrate with generative AI applications, and much more.\n\nUse cases enabled by Elasticsearch include:\n\n* https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/articles/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]\n* https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/vector-search[Vector search]\n* Full-text search\n* Logs\n* Metrics\n* Application performance monitoring (APM)\n* Security logs\n\n\\... and more!\n\nTo learn more about Elasticsearch's features and capabilities, see our\nhttps://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[product page].\n\nTo access information on https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/ml-research[machine learning innovations] and the latest https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/lucene[Lucene contributions from Elastic], more information can be found in https://www.elastic.co/search-labs[Search Labs].\n\n[[get-started]]\n== Get started\n\nThe simplest way to set up Elasticsearch is to create a managed deployment with\nhttps://www.elastic.co/cloud/as-a-service[Elasticsearch Service on Elastic\nCloud].\n\nIf you prefer to install and manage Elasticsearch yourself, you can download\nthe latest version from\nhttps://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch].\n\n=== Run Elasticsearch locally\n\n////\nIMPORTANT: This content is replicated in the Elasticsearch repo. See `run-elasticsearch-locally.asciidoc`.\nEnsure both files are in sync.\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/start-local is the source of truth.\n////\n\n[WARNING]\n====\nDO NOT USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS.\n\nThis setup is intended for local development and testing only.\n====\n\nQuickly set up Elasticsearch and Kibana in Docker for local development or testing, using the https://github.com/elastic/start-local?tab=readme-ov-file#-try-elasticsearch-and-kibana-locally[`start-local` script].\n\nℹ️ For more detailed information about the `start-local` setup, refer to the https://github.com/elastic/start-local[README on GitHub].\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n- If you don't have Docker installed, https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[download and install Docker Desktop] for your operating system.\n- If you're using Microsoft Windows, then install https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)].\n\n==== Trial license\nThis setup comes with a one-month trial license that includes all Elastic features.\n\nAfter the trial period, the license reverts to *Free and open - Basic*.\nRefer to https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Elastic subscriptions] for more information.\n\n==== Run `start-local`\n\nTo set up Elasticsearch and Kibana locally, run the `start-local` script:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\ncurl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh\n----\n// NOTCONSOLE\n\nThis script creates an `elastic-start-local` folder containing configuration files and starts both Elasticsearch and Kibana using Docker.\n\nAfter running the script, you can access Elastic services at the following endpoints:\n\n* *Elasticsearch*: http://localhost:9200\n* *Kibana*: http://localhost:5601\n\nThe script generates a random password for the `elastic` user, which is displayed at the end of the installation and stored in the `.env` file.\n\n[CAUTION]\n====\nThis setup is for local testing only. HTTPS is disabled, and Basic authentication is used for Elasticsearch. For security, Elasticsearch and Kibana are accessible only through `localhost`.\n====\n\n==== API access\n\nAn API key for Elasticsearch is generated and stored in the `.env` file as `ES_LOCAL_API_KEY`.\nUse this key to connect to Elasticsearch with a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[programming language client] or the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html[REST API].\n\nFrom the `elastic-start-local` folder, check the connection to Elasticsearch using `curl`:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\nsource .env\ncurl $ES_LOCAL_URL -H \"Authorization: ApiKey ${ES_LOCAL_API_KEY}\"\n----\n\nTo use the password for the `elastic` user, set and export the `ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD` environment variable. For example:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\nsource .env\nexport ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD\n----\n\n// NOTCONSOLE\n\n=== Send requests to Elasticsearch\n\nYou send data and other requests to Elasticsearch through REST APIs.\nYou can interact with Elasticsearch using any client that sends HTTP requests,\nsuch as the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[Elasticsearch\nlanguage clients] and https://curl.se[curl].\n\n==== Using curl\n\nHere's an example curl command to create a new Elasticsearch index, using basic auth:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\ncurl -u elastic:$ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD \\\n  -X PUT \\\n  http://localhost:9200/my-new-index \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n----\n\n// NOTCONSOLE\n\n==== Using a language client\n\nTo connect to your local dev Elasticsearch cluster with a language client, you can use basic authentication with the `elastic` username and the password stored in the `ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD` environment variable.\n\nYou'll use the following connection details:\n\n* **Elasticsearch endpoint**: `http://localhost:9200`\n* **Username**: `elastic`\n* **Password**: `$ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD` (Value you set in the environment variable)\n\nFor example, to connect with the Python `elasticsearch` client:\n\n[source,python]\n----\nimport os\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n\nusername = 'elastic'\npassword = os.getenv('ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD') # Value you set in the environment variable\n\nclient = Elasticsearch(\n    \"http://localhost:9200\",\n    basic_auth=(username, password)\n)\n\nprint(client.info())\n----\n\n==== Using the Dev Tools Console\n\nKibana's developer console provides an easy way to experiment and test requests.\nTo access the console, open Kibana, then go to **Management** > **Dev Tools**.\n\n**Add data**\n\nYou index data into Elasticsearch by sending JSON objects (documents) through the REST APIs.\nWhether you have structured or unstructured text, numerical data, or geospatial data,\nElasticsearch efficiently stores and indexes it in a way that supports fast searches.\n\nFor timestamped data such as logs and metrics, you typically add documents to a\ndata stream made up of multiple auto-generated backing indices.\n\nTo add a single document to an index, submit an HTTP post request that targets the index.\n\n----\nPOST /customer/_doc/1\n{\n  \"firstname\": \"Jennifer\",\n  \"lastname\": \"Walters\"\n}\n----\n\nThis request automatically creates the `customer` index if it doesn't exist,\nadds a new document that has an ID of 1, and\nstores and indexes the `firstname` and `lastname` fields.\n\nThe new document is available immediately from any node in the cluster.\nYou can retrieve it with a GET request that specifies its document ID:\n\n----\nGET /customer/_doc/1\n----\n\nTo add multiple documents in one request, use the `_bulk` API.\nBulk data must be newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON).\nEach line must end in a newline character (`\\n`), including the last line.\n\n----\nPUT customer/_bulk\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Monica\",\"lastname\":\"Rambeau\"}\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Carol\",\"lastname\":\"Danvers\"}\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Wanda\",\"lastname\":\"Maximoff\"}\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Jennifer\",\"lastname\":\"Takeda\"}\n----\n\n**Search**\n\nIndexed documents are available for search in near real-time.\nThe following search matches all customers with a first name of _Jennifer_\nin the `customer` index.\n\n----\nGET customer/_search\n{\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"match\" : { \"firstname\": \"Jennifer\" }\n  }\n}\n----\n\n**Explore**\n\nYou can use Discover in Kibana to interactively search and filter your data.\nFrom there, you can start creating visualizations and building and sharing dashboards.\n\nTo get started, create a _data view_ that connects to one or more Elasticsearch indices,\ndata streams, or index aliases.\n\n. Go to **Management > Stack Management > Kibana > Data Views**.\n. Select **Create data view**.\n. Enter a name for the data view and a pattern that matches one or more indices,\nsuch as _customer_.\n. Select **Save data view to Kibana**.\n\nTo start exploring, go to **Analytics > Discover**.\n\n[[upgrade]]\n== Upgrade\n\nTo upgrade from an earlier version of Elasticsearch, see the\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html[Elasticsearch upgrade\ndocumentation].\n\n[[build-source]]\n== Build from source\n\nElasticsearch uses https://gradle.org[Gradle] for its build system.\n\nTo build a distribution for your local OS and print its output location upon\ncompletion, run:\n----\n./gradlew localDistro\n----\n\nTo build a distribution for another platform, run the related command:\n----\n./gradlew :distribution:archives:linux-tar:assemble\n./gradlew :distribution:archives:darwin-tar:assemble\n./gradlew :distribution:archives:windows-zip:assemble\n----\n\nDistributions are output to `distribution/archives`.\n\nTo run the test suite, see xref:TESTING.asciidoc[TESTING].\n\n[[docs]]\n== Documentation\n\nFor the complete Elasticsearch documentation visit\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html[elastic.co].\n\nFor information about our documentation processes, see the\nxref:https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/docs/README.md[docs README].\n\n[[examples]]\n== Examples and guides\n\nThe https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs[`elasticsearch-labs`] repo contains executable Python notebooks, sample apps, and resources to test out Elasticsearch for vector search, hybrid search and generative AI use cases.\n\n\n[[contribute]]\n== Contribute\n\nFor contribution guidelines, see xref:CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING].\n\n[[questions]]\n== Questions? Problems? Suggestions?\n\n* To report a bug or request a feature, create a\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/new/choose[GitHub Issue]. Please\nensure someone else hasn't created an issue for the same topic.\n\n* Need help using Elasticsearch? Reach out on the\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co[Elastic Forum] or https://ela.st/slack[Slack]. A\nfellow community member or Elastic engineer will be happy to help you out.\n",

      "readme": "# Apache Flink\n\nApache Flink is an open source stream processing framework with powerful stream- and batch-processing capabilities.\n\nLearn more about Flink at [https://flink.apache.org/](https://flink.apache.org/)\n\n\n### Features\n\n* A streaming-first runtime that supports both batch processing and data streaming programs\n\n* Elegant and fluent APIs in Java\n\n* A runtime that supports very high throughput and low event latency at the same time\n\n* Support for *event time* and *out-of-order* processing in the DataStream API, based on the *Dataflow Model*\n\n* Flexible windowing (time, count, sessions, custom triggers) across different time semantics (event time, processing time)\n\n* Fault-tolerance with *exactly-once* processing guarantees\n\n* Natural back-pressure in streaming programs\n\n* Libraries for Graph processing (batch), Machine Learning (batch), and Complex Event Processing (streaming)\n\n* Custom memory management for efficient and robust switching between in-memory and out-of-core data processing algorithms\n\n* Compatibility layers for Apache Hadoop MapReduce\n\n* Integration with YARN, HDFS, HBase, and other components of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem\n\n\n### Streaming Example\n```java\n// pojo class WordWithCount\npublic class WordWithCount {\n    public String word;\n    public int count;\n\n    public WordWithCount() {}\n    \n    public WordWithCount(String word, int count) {\n        this.word = word;\n        this.count = count;\n    }\n}\n\n// main method\nStreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();\nDataStreamSource<String> text = env.socketTextStream(host, port);\nDataStream<WordWithCount> windowCounts = text\n    .flatMap(\n        (FlatMapFunction<String, String>) (line, collector) \n            -> Arrays.stream(line.split(\"\\\\s\")).forEach(collector::collect)\n    ).returns(String.class)\n    .map(word -> new WordWithCount(word, 1)).returns(TypeInformation.of(WordWithCount.class))\n    .keyBy(wordWithCnt -> wordWithCnt.word)\n    .window(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5)))\n    .sum(\"count\").returns(TypeInformation.of(WordWithCount.class));\n\nwindowCounts.print();\nenv.execute();\n}\n```\n\n### Batch Example\n```java\n// pojo class WordWithCount\npublic class WordWithCount {\n    public String word;\n    public int count;\n\n    public WordWithCount() {}\n\n    public WordWithCount(String word, int count) {\n        this.word = word;\n        this.count = count;\n    }\n}\n\n// main method\nStreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();\nenv.setRuntimeMode(RuntimeExecutionMode.BATCH);\nFileSource<String> source = FileSource.forRecordStreamFormat(new TextLineInputFormat(), new Path(\"MyInput.txt\")).build();\nDataStreamSource<String> text = env.fromSource(source, WatermarkStrategy.noWatermarks(), \"MySource\");\nDataStream<WordWithCount> windowCounts = text\n        .flatMap((FlatMapFunction<String, String>) (line, collector) -> Arrays\n                .stream(line.split(\"\\\\s\"))\n                .forEach(collector::collect)).returns(String.class)\n        .map(word -> new WordWithCount(word, 1)).returns(TypeInformation.of(WordWithCount.class))\n        .keyBy(wordWithCount -> wordWithCount.word)\n        .sum(\"count\").returns(TypeInformation.of(WordWithCount.class));\n\nwindowCounts.print();\nenv.execute();\n```\n\n\n\n## Building Apache Flink from Source\n\nPrerequisites for building Flink:\n\n* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)\n* Git\n* Maven (we require version 3.8.6)\n* Java (version 11, 17, or 21)\n\n### Basic Build Instructions\n\nFirst, clone the repository:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/flink.git\ncd flink\n```\n\nThen, choose one of the following commands based on your preferred Java version:\n\n**For Java 11**\n\n```\n./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Djdk11 -Pjava11-target\n```\n\n**For Java 17 (Default)**\n\n```\n./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Djdk17 -Pjava17-target\n```\n\n**For Java 21**\n\n```\n./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Djdk21 -Pjava21-target\n```\n\nThe build process will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.\nFlink will be installed in `build-target`.\n\n### Notes\n\n* Make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable points to the correct JDK version\n* The build command uses Maven wrapper (mvnw) which ensures the correct Maven version is used\n* The -DskipTests flag skips running tests to speed up the build process\n* Each Java version requires its corresponding profile (-Pjava<version>-target) and JDK flag (-Djdk<version>)\n\n## Developing Flink\n\nThe Flink committers use IntelliJ IDEA to develop the Flink codebase.\nWe recommend IntelliJ IDEA for developing projects that involve Scala code.\n\nMinimal requirements for an IDE are:\n* Support for Java and Scala (also mixed projects)\n* Support for Maven with Java and Scala\n\n\n### IntelliJ IDEA\n\nThe IntelliJ IDE supports Maven out of the box and offers a plugin for Scala development.\n\n* IntelliJ download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)\n* IntelliJ Scala Plugin: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347)\n\nCheck out our [Setting up IntelliJ](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/flinkDev/ide_setup.html#intellij-idea) guide for details.\n\n### Eclipse Scala IDE\n\n**NOTE:** From our experience, this setup does not work with Flink\ndue to deficiencies of the old Eclipse version bundled with Scala IDE 3.0.3 or\ndue to version incompatibilities with the bundled Scala version in Scala IDE 4.4.1.\n\n**We recommend to use IntelliJ instead (see above)**\n\n## Support\n\nDon’t hesitate to ask!\n\nContact the developers and community on the [mailing lists](https://flink.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists) if you need any help.\n\n[Open an issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK) if you find a bug in Flink.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation of Apache Flink is located on the website: [https://flink.apache.org](https://flink.apache.org)\nor in the `docs/` directory of the source code.\n\n\n## Fork and Contribute\n\nThis is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to use the system or contribute to it.\nContact us if you are looking for implementation tasks that fit your skills.\nThis article describes [how to contribute to Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/how-to-contribute.html).\n\n## Externalized Connectors\n\nMost Flink connectors have been externalized to individual repos under the [Apache Software Foundation](https://github.com/apache):\n\n* [flink-connector-aws](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-aws)\n* [flink-connector-cassandra](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-cassandra)\n* [flink-connector-elasticsearch](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-elasticsearch)\n* [flink-connector-gcp-pubsub](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-gcp-pubsub)\n* [flink-connector-hbase](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-hbase)\n* [flink-connector-hive](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-hive)\n* [flink-connector-jdbc](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-jdbc)\n* [flink-connector-kafka](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-kafka)\n* [flink-connector-mongodb](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-mongodb)\n* [flink-connector-opensearch](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-opensearch)\n* [flink-connector-prometheus](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-prometheus)\n* [flink-connector-pulsar](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-pulsar)\n* [flink-connector-rabbitmq](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-rabbitmq)\n\n## About\n\nApache Flink is an open source project of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF).\nThe Apache Flink project originated from the [Stratosphere](http://stratosphere.eu) research project.\n",

API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api),  [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu/files) |\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload and install the [fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/)\n \nDownload the latest [release or pre-release](https://github.com/19MisterX98/SeedCrackerX/releases) of SeedCrackerX\n  \nput the .jar file in your mod directory, either %appdata%/.minecraft/mods/ folder for the vanilla launcher or your own instance folder.\n  \n#### Optional\n  \nDownload the latest release of [Multiconnect](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/multiconnect/releases) or [ViaFabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabric) to connect to servers on lower MC versions\n  \n## Database\n\nSince the mod is used by many people, I have decided to create a Google sheet for server seeds.\nIf you enable the database option in the config gui the mod will send cracked seeds from 10+ player servers directly to the Google sheet.\nYou also need a minecraft license\n\n[The Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tuQiE-0leW88em9OHbZnH-RFNhVqgoHhIt9WQbeqqWw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Usage\n\n## 1.17.X and below\n\n### Overworld\n\nRun around in the world until the mod finds a dungeon. After the mod found one the cracking process starts automatically.\nIf it doesn't give you a world seed, you may need to find another dungeon.\n\n### The Nether\n\nRun around in the warped fungus biome until the mod finds big fungus and starts cracking.\n\n### The End\n\nYou have to find 5 (or more) end cities or end gateways and then return to the center of the end dimension to obtain the pillar seed, after that cracking should begin.\n\n#### Video guides:\n- [Structures and Endpillars](https://youtu.be/aUuPSZVPH8E?t=462)\n- [warped fungus](https://youtu.be/HKjwgofhKs4)\n\n  ### Supported Decorators\n    - Dungeon\n    - End Gateway\n    - Desert Well\n    - Emerald Ore\n    - Warped Fungus\n\n## 1.18.X and higher\n\nDungeon cracking, fungus cracking don't work anymore.\n\n### Overworld\n\nGo to the config menu via \"/seedcracker gui\" (1.19.3+) or \"/seed gui\" (before 1.19.3) and make sure that Emeralds, Gateways, Biomes, Desert wells and Warped fungi are disabled since they aren't updated and can give wrong data.\n\nFor cracking, you now need to get 40 bits of liftable structures and 32 regular bits from the listed ones:\n\n  ### Supported Structures\n  \n    - Igloo - 9 regular and liftable bits\n    - Desert Pyramid - 9 regular and liftable bits\n    - Jungle Temple - 9 regular and liftable bits\n    - Swamp Hut - 9 regular and liftable bits\n    - Shipwreck - 8 regular and liftable bits\n    - Pillager Outpost - 9 liftable bits\n    - Ocean Monument - 9 regular bits\n\nAny combination is valid. For example: 3 shipwrecks, 1 pyramid and 1 igloo.\nYou can track your process with \"/seed data bits\" (look at the bits count for liftable structures)\nA structure is found when there is an outline around it.\nAfter you get enough, the cracking process starts automatically. This process takes around 1-5 mins.\nThe mod may ask you to find additional structures after this.\nIt's more likely to happen with fewer bits and structures of the same type.\nAfter reducing your structure seeds, the mod will brute force your world seed via dungeon positions or hashed seed.\n\n### The Nether\n\nFungus cracking don't work anymore, so there are no way to find nether seed using SeedcrackerX, however you can try to crack it yourself by using [Nether_Bedrock_Cracker](https://github.com/19MisterX98/Nether_Bedrock_Cracker)\n    \n### The End\n\nYou have to find 5 (or more) end cities (fill up regular bits) and then return to the center of the end dimension to obtain the pillar seed, after that cracking should begin.\n\n- You need to disable end gateways!\n\n## Commands\n\nIf version of your mod is older than 2.13.1, use prefix\n - `/seed` instead of `/seedcracker`\n\n  ### GUI Command\n  - `/seedcracker gui`\n  \n  Opens the config gui where you can modify settings like the server mc-version, all finders, database and rendermode.\n  There are command alternatives for most of this, but they shouldn't be used anymore.\n  \n  ### Finder Reload Command\n  - `/seedcracker finder reload`\n\n  Rescans the loaded Chunks to find structures that weren't found before.\n\n  ### Data Command\n  - `/seedcracker data clear`\n  \n  Clears all the collected data without requiring a relog. This is useful for multi-world servers.\n  \n  - `/seedcracker data bits`\n  \n  Display how many bits of information have been collected.\n  Normal bits are used for end pillar + structure cracking. Cracking starts at 32 bits.\n  Lifting bits are used for liftable structure cracking. Cracking starts at 40 bits.\n  \n  - `/seed data restore`\n  \n  When you leave a world, the mod will save currently collected structure information in a file of the .minecraft/config directory.\n  After rejoining, you can restore it with this command.\n  \n  \n  ### Debug Command\n  - `/seedcracker cracker debug`\n\n  Additional info is shown\n  \n  ### Database Command\n  - `/seedcracker database`\n  \n  Opens a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tuQiE-0leW88em9OHbZnH-RFNhVqgoHhIt9WQbeqqWw/edit?usp=sharing) that is maintained by the mod\n  \n## Video Tutorials\n\nNeil's:\n- [1.15](https://youtu.be/1ChmLi9og8Q)\n- [1.16](https://youtu.be/aUuPSZVPH8E)\n\nDyiing's\n- [1.18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKeEyx7jIE4)\n\nMine:\n- [Dungeon cracking & end pillar cracking](https://youtu.be/8ytfZ2MXosY)\n- [Nether cracking](https://youtu.be/HKjwgofhKs4)\n- [Structure cracking](https://youtu.be/UXVrBaOR8H0)\n\n\n## Setting up the Workspace\n\n-Clone the repository.\n\n-Run `gradlew genSources <idea|eclipse>`.\n\n## Building the Mod\n\n-Update the version in `build.gradle` and `fabric.mod.json`.\n\n-Run `gradlew build`.\n\n## API for other mods\n\n- Include seedcracker-api and jitpack in your build.gradle\n\n      repositories {\n          mavenCentral()\n          maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\n      }\n      \n      dependencies {\n          implementation (include('com.github.19MisterX98.SeedcrackerX:seedcrackerx-api:master-SNAPSHOT')) {transitive = false}\n      }\n\n- Add a class that implements the api interface\n\n      package misterx.myMod.seedManagemnet.SeedCrackerEP\n      \n      import kaptainwutax.seedcrackerX.api.SeedCrackerAPI;\n    \n      public class SeedCrackerEP implements SeedCrackerAPI {\n          @Override\n          public void pushWorldSeed(long seed) {\n              //do something\n              Foo.bar(seed)\n          }\n      }\n\n- Tell fabric.mod.json where your entrypoint is\n\n      \"entrypoints\": {\n        \"main\": [...],\n        \"client\": [...],\n        \"server\": [...],\n        \"seedcrackerx\": [\n          \"misterx.myMod.seedManagemnet.SeedCrackerEP\"\n        ]\n      },\n\n## Contributors\n\n[KaptainWutax](https://github.com/KaptainWutax) - Author of the original mod\n\n[neil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUuPSZVPH8E) - Video Tutorials\n\n[Nekzuris](https://github.com/Nekzuris) and [ItzSkyReed](https://github.com/ItzSkyReed)  - README\n\n[19MisterX98](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCby9ZxEjJCqmccQGF3GSYlA) - Author of SeedCrackerX\n",

See the\n[WASM build](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/substrate/index.html#wasm-build)\nin the Polkadot SDK Documentation.\n\n#### PolkaVM\nPolkaVM builds require some `riscv32` or `riscv64` target architecture.  \nSee the CI example: [RiscV-build](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/6de451a105ca0a5feb675a215d4e8de5207febf6/.github/workflows/build-misc.yml#L55).\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\n* [Polkadot Documentation Portal](https://docs.polkadot.com)\n* [🦀 rust-docs](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/index.html): Where we keep track of\nthe API docs of our Rust crates. Includes:\n  * [Introduction](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/index.html)\n\tto each component of the Polkadot SDK: Substrate, FRAME, Cumulus, and XCM\n  * [Guides](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/guides/index.html),\n\tnamely how to build your first FRAME pallet\n  * [Templates](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/templates/index.html)\n    for starting a new project.\n  * [External Resources](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/external_resources/index.html)\n* Have a question? You can ask in the Polkadot SDK Developers Chat.\nMessages from either of these channels are bridged to the other, so you can use whichever one you like.\n  * [Telegram](https://t.me/substratedevs)\n  * [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#substratedevs:matrix.org)\n  * [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/722223075629727774/997505821955076196)\n  * [Polkadot and Substrate StackExchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/)\n\n## 🚀 Releases\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD013 -->\n![Current Stable Release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/release-registry/main/badges/polkadot-sdk-latest.svg)&nbsp;&nbsp;![Next Stable Release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paritytech/release-registry/main/badges/polkadot-sdk-next.svg)\n\nThe Polkadot SDK is released every three months as a `Polkadot stableYYMM` release. Each stable release is supported for\none year with patches. See the next upcoming versions in the [Release\nRegistry](https://github.com/paritytech/release-registry/) and more docs in [RELEASE.md](./docs/RELEASE.md).\n\nYou can use [`psvm`](https://github.com/paritytech/psvm) to update all dependencies to a specific\nversion without needing to manually select the correct version for each crate.\n\n## 🛠️ Tooling\n\n[Polkadot SDK Version Manager](https://github.com/paritytech/psvm):\nA simple tool to manage and update the Polkadot SDK dependencies in any Cargo.toml file.\nIt will automatically update the Polkadot SDK dependencies to their correct crates.io version.\n\n## 🔐 Security\n\nThe security policy and procedures can be found in\n[docs/contributor/SECURITY.md](./docs/contributor/SECURITY.md).\n\n## 🤍 Contributing & Code of Conduct\n\nEnsure you follow our [contribution guidelines](./docs/contributor/CONTRIBUTING.md). In every\ninteraction and contribution, this project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of\nConduct](./docs/contributor/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### 👾 Ready to Contribute?\n\nTake a look at the issues labeled with [`mentor`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/labels/C1-mentor)\n(or alternatively [this](https://mentor.tasty.limo/) page, created by one of the maintainers) label to get started!\nWe always recognize valuable contributions by proposing an on-chain tip to the Polkadot network as a token of our\nappreciation.\n\n## Polkadot Fellowship\n\nDevelopment in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,\nthis repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,\nthe actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the\nfellowship, this separation, the RFC process\n[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).\n\n## History\n\nThis repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,\nnamely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus. Read more about the merge and its history\n[here](https://polkadot-public.notion.site/Polkadot-SDK-FAQ-fbc4cecc2c46443fb37b9eeec2f0d85f).\n",

Its successor is available [here](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/Amethyst-Android).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* [Introduction](#introduction)\n* [Getting PojavLauncher](#getting-pojavlauncher)\n* [Building](#building)\n    * [Quick Build (Recommended)](#quick-build-recommended)\n    * [Detailed Build](#detailed-build)\n* [Current Status](#current-status)\n* [Known Issues](#known-issues)\n* [FAQ](#faq)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [Support](#support)\n* [License](#license)\n* [Credits & Dependencies](#credits--dependencies)\n* [Roadmap](#roadmap)\n\n## Introduction\n\n* PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk)\n* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 1.21 snapshots (including Combat Test versions)\n* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported.\n* This repository contains source code for Android. For iOS/iPadOS, check out [PojavLauncher_iOS](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS).\n\n## Getting PojavLauncher\n\nYou can get PojavLauncher via three methods:\n\n1. **Releases:** Download the prebuilt app from our [stable releases](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases) or [automatic builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions).\n2. **Google Play:** Get it from Google Play by clicking on this badge: [![Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kdt.pojavlaunch)\n3. **Build from Source:** Follow the [building instructions](#building) below.\n\n## Building\n\n### Quick Build (Recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to build PojavLauncher is to use the pre-built JREs provided by our CI.\n\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher.git`\n2. Build the launcher: `./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug` (Use `gradlew.bat` on Windows)\n\nThe built APK will be located in `app_pojavlauncher/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.\n\n### Detailed Build\n\nIf you need more control over the build process, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Download the `jre8-pojav` artifact from our [CI auto builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions).  This package contains pre-built JREs for all supported architectures.  If you need to build the JRE yourself, follow the instructions in the [android-openjdk-build-multiarch](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch) repository.\n\n2. **LWJGL:** The build instructions for the custom LWJGL are available over the [LWJGL repository](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3).\n\n3. **Language List:** Because languages are auto-added by Crowdin, you need to run the language list generator before building. In the project directory, run:\n   * Linux/macOS:\n     ```bash\n     chmod +x scripts/languagelist_updater.sh\n     bash scripts/languagelist_updater.sh\n     ```\n   * Windows:\n     ```batch\n     scripts\\languagelist_updater.bat\n     ```\n\n4. **Build GLFW stub:** `./gradlew :jre_lwjgl3glfw:build`\n\n5. **Build the launcher:** `./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug` (Replace `gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` on Windows).\n\n## Current Status\n\n* [x] OpenJDK 8 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64\n* [x] OpenJDK 17 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64\n* [x] OpenJDK 21 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64\n* [x] Headless mod installer\n* [x] Mod installer with GUI\n* [x] OpenGL in OpenJDK environment\n* [x] OpenAL (works on most devices)\n* [x] Support for Minecraft 1.12.2 and below\n* [x] Support for Minecraft 1.13 and above\n* [x] Support for Minecraft 1.17 (22w13a) and above\n* [x] Game surface zooming\n* [x] New input pipe rewritten to native code\n* [x] Rewritten entire controls system\n* [ ] More to come!\n\n## Known Issues\n\nSee our [issue tracker](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/issues) for a list of known issues and their current status.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee our [wiki](https://pojavlauncherteam.github.io/) for more information.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. For example, you can help improve the [wiki](https://pojavlauncherteam.github.io/), contribute to the [translations](https://crowdin.com/project/pojavlauncher), or submit bug reports and feature requests.\n\nAny code change should be submitted as a pull request.

Additionally there is save button in the top menu.\n\n#### How do I save files to SD Cards?\nBrowse to the start folder of your SD Card and press the + button (using file browser or the menu option). Now press the plus button and follow the steps in the dialog. Afterwards Markor's file browser won't strike out filenames anymore and files are writable.\n\n![sdcard-mount](doc/assets/2019-05-06-sdcard-mount.webp)\n\n#### How to synchronize files?\nMarkor is and will stay an offline focused application. It works with sync synchronization apps, they have to do syncing respectively.\nSync clients known to work in combination include BitTorrent Sync, Dropbox, FolderSync, OwnCloud, NextCloud, Seafile, Syncthing, Syncopoli and others.  \nThe project recommendation is Syncthing. [-> Guide for Syncthing](doc/2020-04-04-syncthing-file-sync-setup-how-to-use-with-markor.md)\n\n#### What is Notebook?\nThe root folder of your files! Markor starts with this folder at the main screen and allows you to browse files. You can work at any (accessible) file & location with Markor.\n\n#### What is ToDo?\nYour main to-do list file in todo.txt format. You can access it by swiping once at the main screen, by selecting todo.txt at Notebook, or by using the dedicated launcher. You can also open it from Notebook or other apps! You will also have the option to create a to-do task when sharing text into Markor when the text is just one line. The location of this file is freely choosable and independent from the Notebook directory.\n\n#### What is QuickNote?\nThe fastest and easiest way to take notes! QuickNote is a file in Markdown format with a freely choosable file location. You can access it by swiping twice at the main screen, by selecting QuickNote at Notebook, or by using the dedicated launcher. The location of this file is freely choosable and independent from the Notebook directory.\n\n#### How can I encrypt my notes?\nYou have to set a master password in Settings/General/File encryption password and toggle \"Encrypt file content\" when you create a note that you want encrypted.\nIf you want to use a different password for a different file you will have to change the master password before you create that file.\nMarkor remembers locally only the last used password and automatically decrypts only the content of the files that use the most recent password, if you don't want markor to automatically decrypt any file you can set the master password to some random string. \n\n#### Launchers\nA launcher is a \"start menu option\" in your devices launcher (=appdrawer / start menu). When Markor is installed you have the start menu option for Markor. When the Markor settings option \"Launcher (Special Documents)\" is enabled, you get the additional start menu options for ToDo and QuickNote. Note that a device restart is required when you change this option.\n\n## Format: Markdown\n#### What is Markdown?\nA general purpose markup format for documents of all kinds. As Markdown gets converted to HTML prior displaying a rendered view, you can also include HTML in the text, thus you can do everything web browsers can do.\n\nCommonMark is the specification that the markdown parser used in Markor implements.\n\n| **Resources** | |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| [CommonMark tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)           | Learn Markdown in 10 minutes |\n| [CommonMark help](http://commonmark.org/help/)                        | Quick reference and interactive tutorial for learning Markdown. |\n| [CommonMark Spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/)                        | CommonMark Markdown Specification |\n| [daringfireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) | Syntax documentation the Markdown creator |\n\n\n#### Links to files that contains spaces\nMost Markdown applications use URL encoding for links, so does Markor. This means replace every space` ` with `%20`. This ensures that your Markdown content is compatible with most other Markdown applications.<br/><br/>\n\nMarkor has a dedicated button for adding links and file references, which automatically applies this appropiate format.  Take a look at this [video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6735650/63089879-e6aa9400-bf48-11e9-87c1-78a1ba1c444f.gif) to find out where the file reference button is located and how to use it.<br/><br/>\n\nExample: `[alt](my cool file.md)` ⮕ `[alt](my%20cool%20file.md)`.\n\n#### Can I use Markor in class to write down equations? (Math)\nYes, Markor has advanced functionalities for math! Enable the feature by checking Settings»Format»Markdown»Math.<br/><br/>\n\nMarkor's [markdown-reference.md](samples/markor-markdown-reference.md) template (available from new file dialog) showcases some examples.  \nLearn more about available functions and symbols here: [1](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html), [2](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html)\n\n\n## Format: todo.txt\n#### What is todo.txt?\nTodo.txt is a simple text format for todo. Each line of text is a task. The idea comes from [Gina Trapani](https://github.com/ginatrapani).\n\n| **Resources** | |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| [Homepage](http://todotxt.org/)                                                       | Todo.txt's home      |\n| [Format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt/blob/master/README.md)                   | Syntax documentation |\n| [User Documentation](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli/wiki/User-Documentation) | User documentation   |\n\n\n![todotxt](doc/assets/todotxt-format-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n![todotxt](doc/assets/todotxt-format.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n\n#### How to mark a task done?\nDone tasks are marked by a `x ` in begining of the line and can optionally be moved to a done/archive file.\n\n#### What is a context (@)?\n  With contexts you can mark a situation or place. You may use it to categorize your todos. Context is part of todo.txt format, add `@` in front of a word to create one.  \n  Examples: @home @work\n\n#### What is a project (+)?\n  With projects you can group tasks by a specific project. You may use it to tag your todos with recognizable meta information. Context is part of todo.txt format, add `+` in front of a word to create one.  \n  Examples: +video +download +holidayPlanning\n\n",

By\nmaking robust banking technology openly available, it lowers barriers for\ninstitutions and innovators to reach underserved and unbanked populations.\n\nHave a look at the [documentation](https://fineract.apache.org/docs/current), the [wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT) or at the [FAQ](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91554327), if this README does not answer what you are looking for.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY\n=========\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this project, but perhaps don't quite know how and where to get started, please [join our developer mailing list](http://fineract.apache.org/#contribute), listen into our conversations, chime into threads, or just send us a \"Hello!\" introduction email; we're a friendly bunch, and look forward to hearing from you. A more informal alternative is the [Fineract Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T0F5GHE8Y/C028634A61L) (thank you, Mifos, for supporting the Slack channel!).\n\nFor the developer wiki, see [Contributor's Zone](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Contributor%27s+Zone). Maybe [these how-to articles](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/How-to+articles) help you to get started.\n\nIn any case visit [our JIRA Dashboard](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12335824) to find issues to work on, see what others are doing, or open new issues.\n\nIn the moment you get started writing code, please consult our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, where you will find more information on subjects like coding style, testing and pull requests.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n============\n* min. 16GB RAM and 8 core CPU\n* `MariaDB >= 11.5.2` or `PostgreSQL >= 17.0`\n* `Java >= 21` (Azul Zulu JVM is tested by our CI on GitHub Actions)\n\nTomcat (min. v10) is only required, if you wish to deploy the Fineract WAR to a separate external servlet container.  You do not need to install Tomcat to run Fineract. We recommend the use of the self-contained JAR, which transparently embeds a servlet container using Spring Boot.\n\n\nSECURITY\n============\nFor a list of known vulnerabilities, see [Apache Fineract Security Reports](https://fineract.apache.org/security.html).\n\nIf you believe you have found a new vulnerability, [let us know privately](https://fineract.apache.org/#contribute).\n\nFor details about security during development and deployment, see the documentation [here](https://fineract.apache.org/docs/current/#_security).\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n============\n\nThe following how-to's assume you have Java installed, you cloned the repository (or downloaded and extracted a [specific version](https://github.com/apache/fineract/releases)) and you have a [database server](#database-and-tables) (MariaDB or PostgreSQL) running.\n\nHow to run for local development\n---\n\nRun the following commands in this order:\n```bash\n./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_tenants\n./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_default\n./gradlew devRun\n```\n\nThis creates two databases and builds and runs Fineract, which will be listening for API requests on port 8443 (by default) now.\n\nConfirm Fineract is ready with, for example:\n\n```bash\ncurl --insecure https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/actuator/health\n```\n\nTo test authenticated endpoints, include credentials in your request:\n\n```bash\ncurl --location \\\n  https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/api/v1/clients \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --header 'Fineract-Platform-TenantId: default' \\\n  --header 'Authorization: Basic bWlmb3M6cGFzc3dvcmQ='\n```\n\nHow to run for production\n---\nRunning Fineract to try it out is relatively easy. If you intend to use it in a production environment, be aware that a proper deployment can be complex, costly, and time-consuming. Considerations include: Security, privacy, compliance, performance, service availability, backups, and more. The Fineract project does not provide a comprehensive guide for deploying Fineract in production. You might need skills in enterprise Java applications and more. Alternatively, you could pay a vendor for Fineract deployment and maintenance. You will find tips and tricks for deploying and securing Fineract in our official documentation and in the community-maintained wiki.\n\n\nHow to build the JAR file\n---\nBuild a modern, cloud native, fully self contained JAR file:\n```bash\n./gradlew clean bootJar\n```\nThe JAR will be created in the `fineract-provider/build/libs` directory.\nAs we are not allowed to include a JDBC driver in the built JAR, download a JDBC driver of your choice. For example:\n```bash\nwget https://dlm.mariadb.com/4174416/Connectors/java/connector-java-3.5.2/mariadb-java-client-3.5.2.jar\n```\nStart the JAR and specify the directory containing the JDBC driver using the loader.path option, for example:\n```bash\njava -Dloader.path=. -jar fineract-provider/build/libs/fineract-provider.jar\n```\nThis does not require an external Tomcat.\n\nThe tenants database connection details are configured [via environment variables (as with Docker container)](#instructions-to-run-using-docker-or-podman), e.g. like this:\n```bash\nexport FINERACT_HIKARI_PASSWORD=verysecret\n...\njava -jar fineract-provider.jar\n```\n\nHow to build the WAR file\n---\nBuild a traditional WAR file:\n```bash\n./gradlew :fineract-war:clean :fineract-war:war\n```\nThe WAR will be created in the `fineract-war/build/libs` directory. Afterwards deploy the WAR to your Tomcat Servlet Container.\n\nWe recommend using the JAR instead of the WAR file deployment, because it's much easier.\n\n\nHow to run using Docker or Podman\n---\n\nIt is possible to do a 'one-touch' installation of Fineract using containers (AKA \"Docker\").\nThis includes the database running in the container.\n\nAs prerequisites, you must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine; see\n[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\n\nAlternatively, you can also use [Podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod)\n(e.g. via `dnf install podman-docker`), and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/)\n(e.g. via `pip3 install podman-compose`) instead of Docker.\n\nTo run a new Fineract instance on Linux you can simply:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git\ncd fineract\n./gradlew :fineract-provider:jibDockerBuild -x test\n```\nOn Windows, do this instead:\n```cmd\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git --config core.autocrlf=input\ncd fineract\ngradlew :fineract-provider:jibDockerBuild -x test\n```\nInstall the Loki log driver and start:\n```bash\ndocker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest \\\n  --alias loki --grant-all-permissions\ndocker compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up -d\n```\nThe Fineract (back-end) should be running at https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/ now.\nWait for https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/actuator/health to return `{\"status\":\"UP\"}`.\nYou must go to https://localhost:8443 and remember to accept the self-signed SSL certificate of the API once in your browser.\n\n[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract) has a pre-built container image of this project, built continuously.\n\nYou must specify the MySQL tenants database JDBC URL by passing it to the `fineract` container via environment\nvariables; please consult the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) for exact details how to specify those.\n\nThe logfiles and the Java Flight Recorder output are available in `PROJECT_ROOT/build/fineract/logs`. If you use IntelliJ then you can double-click on the `.jfr` file and open it with the IDE. You can also download [Azul Mission Control](https://www.azul.com/products/components/azul-mission-control/) to analyze the Java Flight Recorder file.\n\nNOTE: If you have issues with the file permissions and Docker Compose then you might need to change the variable values for `FINERACT_USER` and `FINERACT_GROUP` in `PROJECT_ROOT/config/docker/env/fineract-common.env`. You can find out what values you need to put there with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nid -u ${USER}\nid -g ${GROUP}\n```\n\nPlease make sure that you are not checking in your changed values. The defaults should work for most people.\n\n\nHow to run on Kubernetes\n---\n\n### General Clusters\n\nYou can also run Fineract using containers on a Kubernetes cluster.\nMake sure you set up and connect to your Kubernetes cluster.\nYou can follow [this](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Install+and+configure+kubectl+and+Google+Cloud+SDK+on+ubuntu+16.04) guide to set up a Kubernetes cluster on GKE. Make sure to replace `apache-fineract-cn` with `apache-fineract`\n\nNow e.g. from your Google Cloud shell, run the following commands:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git\ncd fineract/kubernetes\n./kubectl-startup.sh\n```\n\nTo shutdown and reset your Cluster, run:\n```bash\n./kubectl-shutdown.sh\n```\n\n### Using Minikube\n\nAlternatively, you can run fineract on a local kubernetes cluster using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).\nAs prerequisite you must have `minikube` and `kubectl` installed on your machine; see\n[Minikube & Kubectl install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).\n\nTo run a new Fineract instance on Minikube you can simply:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git\ncd fineract/kubernetes\nminikube start\n./kubectl-startup.sh\n```\n\nWait for all pods to be ready:\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -w\n```\n\nOnce all pods are running, access the Mifos web application:\n```bash\nminikube service mifos-community\n```\n\nThis opens the Mifos X web application in your browser. The nginx reverse proxy in the mifos-community pod forwards API requests to the fineract-server backend.\n\n**Default credentials:**\n- Username: `mifos`\n- Password: `password`\n\nYou can also access the Fineract API directly:\n```bash\nminikube service fineract-server --url --https\n```\n\nFineract is now running at the printed URL, which you can check e.g. using:\n```bash\nhttp --verify=no --timeout 240 --check-status get $(minikube service fineract-server --url --https)/fineract-provider/actuator/health\n```\n\nTo check the status of your containers on your local minikube Kubernetes cluster, run:\n```bash\nminikube dashboard\n```\n\nYou can check Fineract logs using:\n```bash\nkubectl logs deployment/fineract-server\n```\n\nYou can check Mifos web app logs using:\n```bash\nkubectl logs deployment/mifos-community\n```\n\nTo shutdown and reset your cluster, run:\n```bash\n./kubectl-shutdown.sh\n```\n\n\nHow to enable External Message Broker (ActiveMQ or Apache Kafka)\n---\n\nThere are two use-cases where external message broker is needed:\n - External Business Events / Reliable Event Framework\n - Executing Partitioned Spring Batch Jobs\n\nExternal Events are business events, e.g.: `ClientCreated`, which might be important for third party systems. Apache Fineract supports ActiveMQ (or other JMS compliant brokers) and Apache Kafka endpoints for sending out Business Events. By default, they are not emitted.\n\nIn case of a large deployment with millions of accounts, the Close of Business Day Spring Batch job may run several hours. In order to speed up this task, remote partitioning of the job is supported. The Manager node partitions breaks up the COB job into smaller pieces (sub tasks), which then can be executed on multiple Worker nodes in parallel. The worker nodes are notified either by ActiveMQ or Kafka regarding their new sub tasks.\n\n### ActiveMQ\n\nJMS based messaging is disabled by default. In `docker-compose-postgresql-activemq.yml` an example is shown, where ActiveMQ is enabled. In that configuration one Spring Batch Manager instance and two Spring Batch Worker instances are created.\nSpring based events should be disabled and jms based event handling should be enabled. Furthermore, proper broker JMS URL should be configured.\n\n```\n      FINERACT_REMOTE_JOB_MESSAGE_HANDLER_JMS_ENABLED=true\n      FINERACT_REMOTE_JOB_MESSAGE_HANDLER_SPRING_EVENTS_ENABLED=false\n      FINERACT_REMOTE_JOB_MESSAGE_HANDLER_JMS_BROKER_URL=tcp://activemq:61616\n```\n\nFor additional ActiveMQ related configuration please take a look to the `application.properties` where the supported configuration parameters are listed with their default values.\n\n### Kafka\n\nKafka support is also disabled by default. In `docker-compose-postgresql-kafka.yml` an example is shown, where self-hosted Kafka is enabled for both External Events and Spring Batch Remote Job execution.\n\nDuring the development Fineract was tested with PLAINTEXT Kafka brokers without authentication and with AWS MSK using IAM authentication. The extra [JAR file](https://github.com/aws/aws-msk-iam-auth/releases) required for IAM authentication is already added to the classpath.\nAn example MSK setup can be found in `docker-compose-postgresql-kafka-msk.yml`.\n\nThe full list of supported Kafka related properties is documented in the [Fineract Platform documentation](https://fineract.apache.org/docs/current/).\n\n\nDATABASE AND TABLES\n===================\n\nYou can run the required version of the database server in a container, instead of having to install it, like this:\n\n    docker run --name mariadb-11.5 -p 3306:3306 -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql -d mariadb:11.5.2\n\nand stop and destroy it like this:\n\n    docker rm -f mariadb-11.5\n\nBeware that this container database keeps its state inside the container and not on the host filesystem.  It is lost when you destroy (rm) this container.  This is typically fine for development.  See [Caveats: Where to Store Data on the database container documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) regarding how to make it persistent instead of ephemeral.\n\n\nMySQL/MariaDB and UTC timezone\n---\nWith release `1.8.0` we introduced improved date time handling in Fineract. Date time is stored in UTC, and UTC timezone enforced even on the JDBC driver, e. g. for MySQL:\n\n```\nserverTimezone=UTC&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&sessionVariables=time_zone='-00:00'\n```\n\nIf you use MySQL as Fineract database, the following configuration is highly recommended:\n\n* Run the application in UTC (the default command line in our Docker image has the necessary parameters already set)\n* Run the MySQL database server in UTC (if you use managed services like AWS RDS, then this should be the default anyway, but it would be good to double-check)\n\nIn case Fineract and MySQL do not run in UTC, MySQL might save date time values differently from PostgreSQL\n\nExample scenario: If the Fineract instance runs in timezone: GMT+2, and the local date time is 2022-08-11 17:15 ...\n* ... then PostgreSQL saves the LocalDateTime as is: 2022-08-11 17:15\n* ... and MySQL saves the LocalDateTime in UTC: 2022-08-11 15:15\n* ... but when we read the date time from PostgreSQL or from MySQL, both systems give us the same value: 2022-08-11 17:15 GMT+2\n\nIf a previously used Fineract instance didn't run in UTC (backward compatibility), all prior dates will be read wrongly by MySQL. This can cause issues, when you run the database migration scripts.\n\nRecommendation: Shift all dates in your database by the timezone offset that your Fineract instance used.\n\n\nCONNECTION POOL CONFIGURATION\n=======\n\nPlease check `application.properties` to see which connection pool settings can be tweaked. The associated environment variables are prefixed with `FINERACT_HIKARI_*`. You can find more information about specific connection pool settings at the [HikariCP Github repository](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP?tab=readme-ov-file#gear-configuration-knobs-baby).\n\nNOTE: We keep backwards compatibility until one of the next releases to ensure that things are working as expected. Environment variables prefixed `fineract_tenants_*` can still be used to configure the database connection, but we strongly encourage using `FINERACT_HIKARI_*` with more options.\n\n\nVERSIONS\n============\n\nA release version is derived from source control. The version will include `-SNAPSHOT` unless the current branch looks like a release or release maintenance branch. See `gitVersioning` settings in `build.gradle` for details.\n\nThe latest stable release can be viewed on the develop branch: [Latest Release on Develop](https://github.com/apache/fineract/tree/develop \"Latest Release\").\n\nThe progress of this project can be viewed in the left hand navigation under [this page of the wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Fineract+Releases)\n\n\nLICENSE\n============\n\nThis project is licensed under [Apache License Version 2.0](https://github.com/apache/fineract/blob/develop/APACHE_LICENSETEXT.md).\n\nThe Connector/J JDBC Driver client library from [MariaDB](https://www.mariadb.org) is licensed under the LGPL.\nThe library is often used in development when running integration tests that use the Liquibase library. That JDBC\ndriver is however not distributed with the Fineract product and is not required to use the product.\nIf you are a developer and object to using the LGPL licensed Connector/J JDBC driver,\nsimply do not run the integration tests that use the Liquibase library and use another JDBC driver.\nAs discussed in [LEGAL-462](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-462), this project therefore\ncomplies with the [Apache Software Foundation third-party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).\n\n\nPLATFORM API\n============\n\nFineract does not provide a UI, but provides an API. Running Fineract locally, the Swagger documentation can be accessed under `https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/swagger-ui/index.html`. A live version can be accessed via [this Sandbox](https://sandbox.mifos.community/fineract-provider/swagger-ui/index.html) (not hosted by us).\n\nApache Fineract supports client code generation using [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) based on the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). For more instructions on how to generate client code, check [this section](https://fineract.apache.org/docs/current/#_generate_api_client) of the Fineract documentation. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlVd-0YAo6c) documents the use of the Swagger-UI.\n",

      "readme": "# Gson\n\nGson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.\nGson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.\n\nThere are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals.\n\n> [!NOTE]\\\n> Gson is currently in maintenance mode; existing bugs will be fixed, but large new features will likely not be added. If you want to add a new feature, please first search for existing GitHub issues, or create a new one to discuss the feature and get feedback.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> Gson's main focus is on Java. Using it with other JVM languages such as Kotlin or Scala might work fine in many cases, but language-specific features such as Kotlin's non-`null` types or constructors with default arguments are not supported. This can lead to confusing and incorrect behavior.\\\n> When using languages other than Java, prefer a JSON library with explicit support for that language.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> Gson is not a recommended library for interacting with JSON on Android. The open-ended reflection in the Gson runtime doesn't play nicely with shrinking/optimization/obfuscation passes that Android release apps should perform.\\\n> If your app or library may be running on Android, consider using [Kotlin Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/docs/basic-serialization.md#basics) or [Moshi's Codegen](https://github.com/square/moshi?tab=readme-ov-file#codegen),\n> which use code generation instead of reflection. This avoids Gson's runtime crashes when optimizations are applied (usually due to the fields missing or being obfuscated), and results in faster performance on Android devices.\n> The Moshi APIs may be more familiar to users who already know Gson.\n> If you still want to use Gson and attempt to avoid these crashes, you can see how to do so [here](Troubleshooting.md#proguard-r8).\n\n### Goals\n  * Provide simple `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa\n  * Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON\n  * Extensive support of Java Generics\n  * Allow custom representations for objects\n  * Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)\n\n### Download\n\nGradle:\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n  implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.13.2'\n}\n```\n\nMaven:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>\n  <artifactId>gson</artifactId>\n  <version>2.13.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n[Gson jar downloads](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.google.code.gson/gson) are available from Maven Central.\n\n![Build Status](https://github.com/google/gson/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)\n\n### Requirements\n#### Minimum Java version\n- Gson 2.12.0 and newer: Java 8\n- Gson 2.9.0 to 2.11.0: Java 7\n- Gson 2.8.9 and older: Java 6\n\nDespite supporting older Java versions, Gson also provides a JPMS module descriptor (module name `com.google.gson`) for users of Java 9 or newer.\n\n#### JPMS dependencies (Java 9+)\nThese are the optional Java Platform Module System (JPMS) JDK modules which Gson depends on.\nThis only applies when running Java 9 or newer.\n\n- `java.sql` (optional since Gson 2.8.9)\\\nWhen this module is present, Gson provides default adapters for some SQL date and time classes.\n\n- `jdk.unsupported`, respectively class `sun.misc.Unsafe` (optional)\\\nWhen this module is present, Gson can use the `Unsafe` class to create instances of classes without no-args constructor.\nHowever, care should be taken when relying on this. `Unsafe` is not available in all environments and its usage has some pitfalls,\nsee [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()).\n\n#### Minimum Android API level\n\n- Gson 2.11.0 and newer: API level 21\n- Gson 2.10.1 and older: API level 19\n\nOlder Gson versions may also support lower API levels, however this has not been verified.\n\n### Documentation\n  * [API Javadoc](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson): Documentation for the current release\n  * [User guide](UserGuide.md): This guide contains examples on how to use Gson in your code\n  * [Troubleshooting guide](Troubleshooting.md): Describes how to solve common issues when using Gson\n  * [Releases and change log](https://github.com/google/gson/releases): Latest releases and changes in these versions; for older releases see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)\n  * [Design document](GsonDesignDocument.md): This document discusses issues we faced while designing Gson. It also includes a comparison of Gson with other Java libraries that can be used for Json conversion\n\nPlease use the ['gson' tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gson), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/google/gson/discussions) or the [google-gson Google group](https://groups.google.com/group/google-gson) to discuss Gson or to post questions.\n\n### ProGuard / R8\n\nSee the details in the related section in the [Troubleshooting guide](Troubleshooting.md#proguard-r8).\n\n### Related Content Created by Third Parties\n  * [Gson Tutorial](https://www.studytrails.com/java/json/java-google-json-introduction/) by `StudyTrails`\n  * [Gson Tutorial Series](https://futurestud.io/tutorials/gson-getting-started-with-java-json-serialization-deserialization) by `Future Studio`\n  * [Gson API Report](https://abi-laboratory.pro/java/tracker/timeline/gson/)\n\n### Building\n\nGson uses Maven to build the project:\n```\nmvn clean verify\n```\n\nJDK 17 or newer is required for building, JDK 21 is recommended. Newer JDKs are currently not supported for building (but are supported when _using_ Gson).\n\n### Contributing\n\nSee the [contributing guide](https://github.com/google/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\\nPlease perform a quick search to check if there are already existing issues or pull requests related to your contribution.\n\nKeep in mind that Gson is in maintenance mode. If you want to add a new feature, please first search for existing GitHub issues, or create a new one to discuss the feature and get feedback.\n\n### License\n\nGson is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).\n\n```\nCopyright 2008 Google Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis is not an officially supported Google product.\n",

Other boms\n|\n+-- bundles   Official openHAB extensions\n|   +-- org.openhab.binding.airquality\n|   +-- org.openhab.binding.astro\n|   +-- ...\n|\n+-- features  Part of the runtime dependency resolver (\"Karaf features\")\n|\n+-- itests    Integration tests. Those tests require parts of the framework to run.\n|   +-- org.openhab.binding.astro.tests\n|   +-- org.openhab.binding.avmfritz.tests\n|   +-- ...\n|\n+-- src/etc   Auxilary buildsystem files: The license header for automatic checks for example\n+-- tools     Static code analyser instructions\n|\n+-- CODEOWNERS  This file assigns people to directories so that they are informed if a pull-request\n                would modify their add-ons.\n```\n\n### Command line build\n\nTo build all add-ons from the command-line, type in:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install\n```\n\nMost of the time you do not need to build all bindings, but only the binding you are working on.\nTo simply build only your binding use the `-pl` option.\nFor example to build only the astro binding:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install -pl :org.openhab.binding.astro\n```\n\nIf you have a binding that has dependencies that are dynamically as specified in the feature.xml you can create a `.kar` instead of a `.jar` file.\nA `.kar` file will include the feature.xml and when added to openHAB will load and activate any dependencies specified in the feature.xml file.\nTo create a `.kar` file run Maven with the goal `karaf:kar`:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install karaf:kar -pl :org.openhab.binding.astro\n```\n\nTo improve build times you can add the following options to the command:\n\n| Option                        | Description                                         |\n| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| `-DskipChecks`                | Skip the static analysis (Checkstyle, FindBugs)     |\n| `-DskipTests`                 | Skip the execution of tests                         |\n| `-Dmaven.test.skip=true`      | Skip the compilation and execution of tests         |\n| `-Dfeatures.verify.skip=true` | Skip the Karaf feature verification                 |\n| `-Dspotless.check.skip=true`  | Skip the Spotless code style checks                 |\n| `-o`                          | Work offline so Maven does not download any updates |\n| `-T 1C`                       | Build in parallel, using 1 thread per core          |\n| `-pl :<add-on directory>`     | Build a single add-on                               |\n\nFor example you can skip checks and tests during development with:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install -DskipChecks -DskipTests -pl :org.openhab.binding.astro\n```\n\nAdding these options improves the build time but could hide problems in your code.\nParallel builds are also less easy to debug and the increased load may cause timing sensitive tests to fail.\n\n#### Translations\n\nAdd-on translations are managed via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/openhab-addons).\nThe English translation is taken from the openHAB-addons GitHub repo and automatically imported in Crowdin when changes are made to the English i18n properties file.\nWhen translations are added or updated and approved in Crowdin, a pull request is automatically created by Crowdin.\nTherefore translations should not be edited in the openHAB-addons repo, but only in Crowdin.\nOtherwise translation are overridden by the automatic process.\n\nTo fill the English properties file run the following Maven command on an add-on:\n\n```shell\nmvn i18n:generate-default-translations\n```\n\nThis command can also update the file when things or channel are added or updated.\n\nIn some cases the command does not work, and requires the full plug-in name.\nIn that case use:\n\n```shell\nmvn org.openhab.core.tools:i18n-maven-plugin:5.0.0:generate-default-translations\n```\n\n#### Code Quality\n\nTo check if your code is following the [code style](https://www.openhab.org/docs/developer/guidelines.html#b-code-formatting-rules-style) run:\n\n```shell\nmvn spotless:check\n```\n\nTo reformat your code so it conforms to the code style you can run:\n\n```shell\nmvn spotless:apply\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nWhen your add-on also has an integration test in the `itests` directory, you may need to update the runbundles in the `itest.bndrun` file when the Maven dependencies change.\nMaven can resolve the integration test dependencies automatically by executing:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install -DwithResolver -DskipChecks\n```\n\nThe build generates a `.jar` file per bundle in the respective bundle `/target` directory.\n\n### How to develop via an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n\nWe have assembled some step-by-step guides for different IDEs on our developer documentation website:\n\n<https://www.openhab.org/docs/developer/#setup-the-development-environment>\n\nHappy coding!\n",

For more information, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/).\n\nAdditionally, example code might theoretically modify or delete existing AWS resources. As a matter of due diligence, do the following:\n\n- Be aware of the resources that these examples create or delete.\n- Be aware of the costs that might be charged to your account as a result.\n- Back up your important data.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThis repository thrives on your contributions! ❤️ To get involved, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). 🙏\n\n# Requests\n\nRequests for examples can be made via [Issue tracker](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=type%2Fenhancement&projects=&template=enhancement.yaml&title=%5BEnhancement%5D%3A+%3CDESCRIPTIVE+TITLE+HERE%3E).\n\n## How we prioritize contributions and requests\nOur team reviews all requests, evaluating them for the following:\n- Clarity\n- Relevance\n- Feasibility\n\n**All examples requests should be made as early as possible. For larger examples, this should be at least two months in advance of the required date.**\n\nBased on the evaluation, we determine the priority of each request and allocate resources accordingly. We prioritize requests that are clear, relevant, and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. An accompanying high quality PR increases the chance we can address the request.\n\nPlease note that some requests, such as bug fixes and security issues, take priority over new code examples. Additionally, we have finite resources and our own priorities that guide the development of code examples. If you have any questions or would like to contribute, please refer to our [contribution guide](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Tributaries\n\nThe AWS Documentation includes source code examples from several additional sources.
