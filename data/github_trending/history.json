      "readme": "[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/valkey-io/valkey/graph/badge.svg?token=KYYSJAYC5F)](https://codecov.io/gh/valkey-io/valkey)\n\nThis project was forked from the open source Redis project right before the transition to their new source available licenses.\n\nThis README is just a fast *quick start* document. More details can be found under [valkey.io](https://valkey.io/)\n\n# What is Valkey?\n\nValkey is a high-performance data structure server that primarily serves key/value workloads.\nIt supports a wide range of native structures and an extensible plugin system for adding new data structures and access patterns.\n\n# Building Valkey using `Makefile`\n\nValkey can be compiled and used on Linux, macOS, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD.\nWe support big endian and little endian architectures, and both 32 bit\nand 64 bit systems.\n\nIt may compile on Solaris derived systems (for instance SmartOS) but our\nsupport for this platform is *best effort* and Valkey is not guaranteed to\nwork as well as in Linux, macOS, and \\*BSD.\n\nIt is as simple as:\n\n    % make\n\nTo build with TLS support, you'll need OpenSSL development libraries (e.g.\nlibssl-dev on Debian/Ubuntu).\n\nTo build TLS support as Valkey built-in:\n\n    % make BUILD_TLS=yes\n\nTo build TLS as Valkey module:\n\n    % make BUILD_TLS=module\n\nNote that sentinel mode does not support TLS module.\n\nTo build with experimental RDMA support you'll need RDMA development libraries\n(e.g. librdmacm-dev and libibverbs-dev on Debian/Ubuntu).\n\nTo build RDMA support as Valkey built-in:\n\n    % make BUILD_RDMA=yes\n\nTo build RDMA as Valkey module:\n\n    % make BUILD_RDMA=module\n\nTo build with systemd support, you'll need systemd development libraries (such\nas libsystemd-dev on Debian/Ubuntu or systemd-devel on CentOS) and run:\n\n    % make USE_SYSTEMD=yes\n\nSince Valkey version 8.1, `fast_float` has been introduced as an optional\ndependency, which can speed up sorted sets and other commands that use\nthe double datatype. To build with `fast_float` support, you'll need a\nC++ compiler and run:\n\n    % make USE_FAST_FLOAT=yes\n\nTo build Valkey without the Lua engine:\n\n    % make BUILD_LUA=no\n\nTo append a suffix to Valkey program names, use:\n\n    % make PROG_SUFFIX=\"-alt\"\n\nYou can build a 32 bit Valkey binary using:\n\n    % make 32bit\n\nAfter building Valkey, it is a good idea to test it using:\n\n    % make test\n\nThe above runs the main integration tests. Additional tests are started using:\n\n    % make test-unit     # Unit tests\n    % make test-modules  # Tests of the module API\n    % make test-sentinel # Valkey Sentinel integration tests\n    % make test-cluster  # Valkey Cluster integration tests\n\nMore about running the integration tests can be found in\n[tests/README.md](tests/README.md) and for unit tests, see\n[src/unit/README.md](src/unit/README.md).\n\n## Performance monitoring\n\nValkey Performance Dashboards provide a consolidated view of throughput trends across versions, helping contributors validate improvements and identify regressions quickly.\n\n- [Performance Overview](https://valkey.io/performance/) - Compare throughput across Valkey versions\n- [Unstable Branch Dashboard](https://perf-dashboard.valkey.io/public-dashboards/3e45bf8ded3043edaa941331cd1a94e2) - Track performance of all commits in the unstable branch\n\n## Fixing build problems with dependencies or cached build options\n\nValkey has some dependencies which are included in the `deps` directory.\n`make` does not automatically rebuild dependencies even if something in\nthe source code of dependencies changes.\n\nWhen you update the source code with `git pull` or when code inside the\ndependencies tree is modified in any other way, make sure to use the following\ncommand in order to really clean everything and rebuild from scratch:\n\n    % make distclean\n\nThis will clean: jemalloc, lua, libvalkey, linenoise and other dependencies.\n\nAlso if you force certain build options like 32bit target, no C compiler\noptimizations (for debugging purposes), and other similar build time options,\nthose options are cached indefinitely until you issue a `make distclean`\ncommand.\n\n## Fixing problems building 32 bit binaries\n\nIf after building Valkey with a 32 bit target you need to rebuild it\nwith a 64 bit target, or the other way around, you need to perform a\n`make distclean` in the root directory of the Valkey distribution.\n\nIn case of build errors when trying to build a 32 bit binary of Valkey, try\nthe following steps:\n\n* Install the package libc6-dev-i386 (also try g++-multilib).\n* Try using the following command line instead of `make 32bit`:\n  `make CFLAGS=\"-m32 -march=native\" LDFLAGS=\"-m32\"`\n\n## Allocator\n\nSelecting a non-default memory allocator when building Valkey is done by setting\nthe `MALLOC` environment variable. Valkey is compiled and linked against libc\nmalloc by default, with the exception of jemalloc being the default on Linux\nsystems. This default was picked because jemalloc has proven to have fewer\nfragmentation problems than libc malloc.\n\nTo force compiling against libc malloc, use:\n\n    % make MALLOC=libc\n\nTo compile against jemalloc on Mac OS X systems, use:\n\n    % make MALLOC=jemalloc\n\n## Monotonic clock\n\nBy default, Valkey will build using the POSIX clock_gettime function as the\nmonotonic clock source.  On most modern systems, the internal processor clock\ncan be used to improve performance.  Cautions can be found here:\n    http://oliveryang.net/2015/09/pitfalls-of-TSC-usage/\n\nTo build with support for the processor's internal instruction clock, use:\n\n    % make CFLAGS=\"-DUSE_PROCESSOR_CLOCK\"\n\n## Verbose build\n\nValkey will build with a user-friendly colorized output by default.\nIf you want to see a more verbose output, use the following:\n\n    % make V=1\n\n# Running Valkey\n\nTo run Valkey with the default configuration, just type:\n\n    % cd src\n    % ./valkey-server\n\nIf you want to provide your valkey.conf, you have to run it using an additional\nparameter (the path of the configuration file):\n\n    % cd src\n    % ./valkey-server /path/to/valkey.conf\n\nIt is possible to alter the Valkey configuration by passing parameters directly\nas options using the command line. Examples:\n\n    % ./valkey-server --port 9999 --replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379\n    % ./valkey-server /etc/valkey/6379.conf --loglevel debug\n\nAll the options in valkey.conf are also supported as options using the command\nline, with exactly the same name.\n\n# Running Valkey with TLS:\n\n## Running manually\n\nTo manually run a Valkey server with TLS mode (assuming `./utils/gen-test-certs.sh`\nwas invoked so sample certificates/keys are available):\n\n* TLS built-in mode:\n    ```\n    ./src/valkey-server --tls-port 6379 --port 0 \\\n        --tls-cert-file ./tests/tls/valkey.crt \\\n        --tls-key-file ./tests/tls/valkey.key \\\n        --tls-ca-cert-file ./tests/tls/ca.crt\n    ```\n\n* TLS module mode:\n    ```\n    ./src/valkey-server --tls-port 6379 --port 0 \\\n        --tls-cert-file ./tests/tls/valkey.crt \\\n        --tls-key-file ./tests/tls/valkey.key \\\n        --tls-ca-cert-file ./tests/tls/ca.crt \\\n        --loadmodule src/valkey-tls.so\n    ```\n\nNote that you can disable TCP by specifying `--port 0` explicitly.\nIt's also possible to have both TCP and TLS available at the same time,\nbut you'll have to assign different ports.\n\nUse `valkey-cli` to connect to the Valkey server:\n```\n./src/valkey-cli --tls \\\n    --cert ./tests/tls/valkey.crt \\\n    --key ./tests/tls/valkey.key \\\n    --cacert ./tests/tls/ca.crt\n```\n\nSpecifying `--tls-replication yes` makes a replica connect to the primary.\n\nUsing `--tls-cluster yes` makes Valkey Cluster use TLS across nodes.\n\n# Running Valkey with RDMA:\n\nNote that Valkey Over RDMA is an experimental feature.\nIt may be changed or removed in any minor or major version.\nCurrently, it is only supported on Linux.\n\n* RDMA built-in mode:\n    ```\n    ./src/valkey-server --protected-mode no \\\n         --rdma-bind 192.168.122.100 --rdma-port 6379\n    ```\n\n* RDMA module mode:\n    ```\n    ./src/valkey-server --protected-mode no \\\n         --loadmodule src/valkey-rdma.so --rdma-bind 192.168.122.100 --rdma-port 6379\n    ```\n\nIt's possible to change bind address/port of RDMA by runtime command:\n\n    192.168.122.100:6379> CONFIG SET rdma-port 6380\n\nIt's also possible to have both RDMA and TCP available, and there is no\nconflict of TCP(6379) and RDMA(6379), Ex:\n\n    % ./src/valkey-server --protected-mode no \\\n         --loadmodule src/valkey-rdma.so --rdma-bind 192.168.122.100 --rdma-port 6379 \\\n         --port 6379\n\nNote that the network card (192.168.122.100 of this example) should support\nRDMA. To test a server supports RDMA or not:\n\n    % rdma res show (a new version iproute2 package)\nOr:\n\n    % ibv_devices\n\n\n# Playing with Valkey\n\nYou can use valkey-cli to play with Valkey. Start a valkey-server instance,\nthen in another terminal try the following:\n\n    % cd src\n    % ./valkey-cli\n    valkey> ping\n    PONG\n    valkey> set foo bar\n    OK\n    valkey> get foo\n    \"bar\"\n    valkey> incr mycounter\n    (integer) 1\n    valkey> incr mycounter\n    (integer) 2\n    valkey>\n\n# Installing Valkey\n\nIn order to install Valkey binaries into /usr/local/bin, just use:\n\n    % make install\n\nYou can use `make PREFIX=/some/other/directory install` if you wish to use a\ndifferent destination.\n\n_Note_: For compatibility with Redis, we create symlinks from the Redis names (`redis-server`, `redis-cli`, etc.) to the Valkey binaries installed by `make install`.\nThe symlinks are created in same directory as the Valkey binaries.\nThe symlinks are removed when using `make uninstall`.\nThe creation of the symlinks can be skipped by setting the makefile variable `USE_REDIS_SYMLINKS=no`.\n\n`make install` will just install binaries in your system, but will not configure\ninit scripts and configuration files in the appropriate place. This is not\nneeded if you just want to play a bit with Valkey, but if you are installing\nit the proper way for a production system, we have a script that does this\nfor Ubuntu and Debian systems:\n\n    % cd utils\n    % ./install_server.sh\n\n_Note_: `install_server.sh` will not work on macOS; it is built for Linux only.\n\nThe script will ask you a few questions and will setup everything you need\nto run Valkey properly as a background daemon that will start again on\nsystem reboots.\n\nYou'll be able to stop and start Valkey using the script named\n`/etc/init.d/valkey_<portnumber>`, for instance `/etc/init.d/valkey_6379`.\n\n# Building using `CMake`\n\nIn addition to the traditional `Makefile` build, Valkey supports an alternative, **experimental**, build system using `CMake`.\n\nTo build and install `Valkey`, in `Release` mode (an optimized build), type this into your terminal:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build-release\ncd $_\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/valkey\nsudo make install\n# Valkey is now installed under /opt/valkey\n```\n\nOther options supported by Valkey's `CMake` build system:\n\n## Special build flags\n\n- `-DBUILD_TLS=<yes|no>` enable TLS build for Valkey. Default: `no`\n- `-DBUILD_RDMA=<no|module>` enable RDMA module build (only module mode supported). Default: `no`\n- `-DBUILD_MALLOC=<libc|jemalloc|tcmalloc|tcmalloc_minimal>` choose the allocator to use. Default on Linux: `jemalloc`, for other OS: `libc`\n- `-DBUILD_SANITIZER=<address|thread|undefined>` build with address sanitizer enabled. Default: disabled (no sanitizer)\n- `-DBUILD_UNIT_TESTS=[yes|no]`  when set, the build will produce the executable `valkey-unit-tests`. Default: `no`\n- `-DBUILD_TEST_MODULES=[yes|no]`  when set, the build will include the modules located under the `tests/modules` folder. Default: `no`\n- `-DBUILD_EXAMPLE_MODULES=[yes|no]`  when set, the build will include the example modules located under the `src/modules` folder. Default: `no`\n\n## Common flags\n\n- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<Debug|Release...>` define the build type, see CMake manual for more details\n- `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/installation/path` override this value to define a custom install prefix. Default: `/usr/local`\n- `-G\"<Generator Name>\"` generate build files for \"Generator Name\". By default, CMake will generate `Makefile`s.\n\n## Verbose build\n\n`CMake` generates a user-friendly colorized output by default.\nIf you want to see a more verbose output, use the following:\n\n```bash\nmake VERBOSE=1\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nDuring the `CMake` stage, `CMake` caches variables in a local file named `CMakeCache.txt`. All variables generated by Valkey\nare removed from the cache once consumed (this is done by calling to `unset(VAR-NAME CACHE)`). However, some variables,\nlike the compiler path, are kept in cache. To start a fresh build either remove the cache file `CMakeCache.txt` from the\nbuild folder, or delete the build folder completely.\n\n**It is important to re-run `CMake` when adding new source files.**\n\n## Integration with IDE\n\nDuring the `CMake` stage of the build, `CMake` generates a JSON file named `compile_commands.json` and places it under the\nbuild folder. This file is used by many IDEs and text editors for providing code completion (via `clangd`).\n\nA small caveat is that these tools will look for `compile_commands.json` under the Valkey's top folder.\nA common workaround is to create a symbolic link to it:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/valkey/\n# We assume here that your build folder is `build-release`\nln -sf $(pwd)/build-release/compile_commands.json $(pwd)/compile_commands.json\n```\n\nRestart your IDE and voila\n\n# Code contributions\n\nPlease see the [CONTRIBUTING.md][2].

On Windows 11, it comes pre-installed with the system.\n> However, on Windows 10, the WebView runtime is included with the `setup.exe` installer. Additionally, Microsoft Edge\n> is necessary to function correctly. Some users may have modified their system and removed Edge, so please ensure both\n> Edge and the WebView runtime are installed on your system.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> On fresh installations of Windows, the app might show a white or dark screen. You only need to update your Windows\n> through Windows Update and restart your PC.\n\nYou can choose from different installation options based on your preference:\n\n### Microsoft Store <em>(recommended)</em>\n\nDownload the latest version from the [Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P67C2D4T9FB?ocid=pdpshare) page.\nThis is the recommended option because you will receive updates and a secure version of the program.\n\n_**Note**_: It may take around 1 to 3 business days for changes to be reflected in the Microsoft Store, as updates are\napproved by real people in the store.\n\n### Winget\n\nInstall the latest version using:\n\n```pwsh\nwinget install --id Seelen.SeelenUI\n```\n\nThis option also uses the signed `.msix` package and ensures you have the latest secure version. Similar to the\nMicrosoft Store, it may take around 1 to 3 business days for changes to be reflected in Winget, as updates are approved\nby real people in the `winget-pkg` project.\n\n### .msix Installer\n\nDownload the `.msix` installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/eythaann/seelen-ui/releases) page. This package is\nsigned, ensuring a secure installation. This is the same option as the Microsoft Store but is a portable installer.\n\n### .exe Installer\n\nDownload the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/eythaann/seelen-ui/releases) page and run the\n`setup.exe` installer. This option is less recommended as the installer is not signed, which may cause it to be flagged\nas a potential threat by some antivirus programs. The `setup.exe` is updated more quickly than the Microsoft Store or\nWinget versions and also it receives notifications updates on new release.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed or extracted, simply open the program. The easy-to-use and intuitive GUI will guide you through the\nconfiguration process. Customize your desktop environment effortlessly.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor in-depth details on various aspects of Seelen UI, explore the following documents:\n\n- [Languages](./documentation/languages.md) - Information regarding translations.\n- [Toolbar](./documentation/toolbar.md) - Details about customizing and using the toolbar.\n- [Themes](https://seelen.io/blog/seelen-ui-theme-tutorial) - Guidance on creating and applying themes.\n- [Window Manager](./documentation/window_manager.md) - Instructions on configuring the window manager.\n- [Project](./documentation/project.md) - General information about the project and its structure.\n\n## Upcoming Features\n\nI’m excited to share some upcoming features for Seelen UI! Here’s a glimpse of what’s planned for the future:\n\n### ~~App Launcher~~ ✅\n\nI’m planning to develop an app launcher inspired by [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) on Linux. This feature\nwill provide a sleek and highly customizable way to quickly access your applications.\n\n![App Launcher Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adi1090x/files/master/rofi/previews/colorful/main.gif) _Image\ncourtesy of [rofi-themes](https://github.com/dctxmei/rofi-themes)_\n\n### Customizable Popup Widgets\n\nI aim to introduce a set of fully customizable popup widgets, similar to the features available in\n[EWW](https://github.com/elkowar/eww). These widgets will be highly configurable and adaptable to your needs, providing\nan enhanced and interactive way to manage your desktop environment.\n\n![Customizable Widgets Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adi1090x/widgets/main/previews/dashboard.png) _Image\ncourtesy of [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/widgets)_\n\n### Custom Alt + Tab (Task Switching)\n\nAn upgraded Alt + Tab system for task switching is on the horizon. This will offer a more visually appealing and\nfunctional experience, allowing for smoother transitions between open applications and windows.\n\n### Custom Virtual Desktops Viewer and Animations\n\nI’m also working on a custom virtual desktops viewer and dynamic animations to improve navigation between different\nworkspaces. This will provide a more intuitive and immersive multitasking experience.\n\nStay tuned for more updates as I develop these features. I appreciate your support and enthusiasm!\n\nHappy customizing!\n\nThe Seelen UI Team\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!\n\n- Read the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING) to get started with terms.\n- Read the [Project Documentation](documentation/project.md) to understand the project structure and how to use it.\n\n## License\n\nSee the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor inquiries and support, please contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ABfASx5ZAJ).\n\n## Sponsors\n\nWe're grateful for the support of our sponsors who help make Seelen UI possible.\n\n|                                                                                                         Sponsor                                                                                                          | Description                                                                                                  |\n| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [![DigitalOcean](https://web-platforms.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/WWW/Badge%201.svg)](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=955c7335abf5&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge) | **DigitalOcean** provides cloud infrastructure services that power our development and testing environments. |\n|                                                                [![SignPath](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34448643?s=60)](https://signpath.io/)                                                                | **SignPath** provides free code signing certificates, ensuring secure and trusted releases for our users.    |\n\n## See you later\n\n```\n                 .      .&     _,x&\"``\n                  & .   &'  ;.&&'\n            &.  . &.&     .0&&&;&\"\"`\n       .

It can handle up to 2M tokens of context directly (~100k per file), and can index directories with 20M tokens or more using tree-sitter project maps.\r\n\r\n🔬  **A cumulative diff review sandbox** keeps AI-generated changes separate from your project files until they are ready to go. Command execution is controlled so you can easily roll back and debug. Plandex helps you get the most out of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project.\r\n\r\n🧠  **Combine the best models** from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and open source providers to build entire features and apps with a robust terminal-based workflow.\r\n\r\n🚀  Plandex is capable of <strong>full autonomy</strong>—it can load relevant files, plan and implement changes, execute commands, and automatically debug—but it's also highly flexible and configurable, giving developers fine-grained control and a step-by-step review process when needed.\r\n\r\n💪  Plandex is designed to be resilient to <strong>large projects and files</strong>. If you've found that others tools struggle once your project gets past a certain size or the changes are too complex, give Plandex a shot.\r\n\r\n## Smart context management that works in big projects\r\n\r\n- 🐘 **2M token effective context window** with default model pack. Plandex loads only what's needed for each step.\r\n\r\n- 🗄️ **Reliable in large projects and files.** Easily generate, review, revise, and apply changes spanning dozens of files.\r\n\r\n- 🗺️ **Fast project map generation** and syntax validation with tree-sitter. Supports 30+ languages.\r\n\r\n- 💰 **Context caching** is used across the board for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models, reducing costs and latency.\r\n\r\n## Tight control or full autonomy—it's up to you\r\n\r\n- 🚦 **Configurable autonomy:** go from full auto mode to fine-grained control depending on the task.\r\n\r\n- 🐞 **Automated debugging** of terminal commands (like builds, linters, tests, deployments, and scripts). If you have Chrome installed, you can also automatically debug browser applications.\r\n\r\n## Tools that help you get production-ready results\r\n\r\n- 💬 **A project-aware chat mode** that helps you flesh out ideas before moving to implementation. Also great for asking questions and learning about a codebase.\r\n\r\n- 🧠 **Easily try + combine models** from multiple providers. Curated model packs offer different tradeoffs of capability, cost, and speed, as well as open source and provider-specific packs.\r\n\r\n- 🛡️ **Reliable file edits** that prioritize correctness. While most edits are quick and cheap, Plandex validates both syntax and logic as needed, with multiple fallback layers when there are problems.\r\n\r\n- 🔀 **Full-fledged version control** for every update to the plan, including branches for exploring multiple paths or comparing different models.\r\n\r\n- 📂 **Git integration** with commit message generation and optional automatic commits.\r\n\r\n## Dev-friendly, easy to install\r\n\r\n- 🧑‍💻 **REPL mode** with fuzzy auto-complete for commands and file loading. Just run `plandex` in any project to get started.\r\n\r\n- 🛠️ **CLI interface** for scripting or piping data into context.\r\n\r\n- 📦 **One-line, zero dependency CLI install**. Dockerized local mode for easily self-hosting the server. Cloud-hosting options for extra reliability and convenience.\r\n\r\n## Workflow  🔄\r\n\r\n<img src=\"images/plandex-workflow.png\" alt=\"Plandex workflow\" width=\"100%\"/>\r\n\r\n## Examples  🎥\r\n\r\n  <br/>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-_76U_nK0Y\">\r\n    <img src=\"images/plandex-browser-debug-yt.png\" alt=\"Plandex Browser Debugging Example\" width=\"800\">\r\n  </a>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Install  📥\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -sL https://plandex.ai/install.sh | bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** Windows is supported via [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

You'll be asked if you want to connect a subscription the first time you run Plandex.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Get started  🚀\r\n\r\nFirst, `cd` into a **project directory** where you want to get something done or chat about the project. Make a new directory first with `mkdir your-project-dir` if you're starting on a new project.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd your-project-dir\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a new project, you might also want to initialize a git repo. Plandex doesn't require that your project is in a git repo, but it does integrate well with git if you use it.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit init\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow start the Plandex REPL in your project:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nplandex\r\n```\r\n\r\nor for short:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npdx\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- ☁️ _If you're using Plandex Cloud, you'll be prompted at this point to start a trial._\r\n\r\nThen just give the REPL help text a quick read, and you're ready go. The REPL starts in _chat mode_ by default, which is good for fleshing out ideas before moving to implementation. Once the task is clear, Plandex will prompt you to switch to _tell mode_ to make a detailed plan and start writing code. -->\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Docs  🛠️\r\n\r\n### [👉  Full documentation.](https://docs.plandex.ai/)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Discussion and discord  💬\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to give your feedback, ask questions, report a bug, or just hang out:\r\n\r\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/plandex-ai)\r\n- [Discussions](https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/discussions)\r\n- [Issues](https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex/issues)\r\n\r\n## Follow and subscribe\r\n\r\n- [Follow @PlandexAI](https://x.com/PlandexAI)\r\n- [Follow @Danenania](https://x.com/Danenania) (Plandex's creator)\r\n- [Subscribe on YouTube](https://x.com/PlandexAI)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Contributors  👥\r\n\r\n⭐️  Please star, fork, explore, and contribute to Plandex.

On Mac system:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-server-chart\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@antv/mcp-server-chart\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOn Window system:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-server-chart\": {\n      \"command\": \"cmd\",\n      \"args\": [\"/c\", \"npx\", \"-y\", \"@antv/mcp-server-chart\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, you can use it on [aliyun](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/?tab=mcp#/mcp-market/detail/antv-visualization-chart), [modelscope](https://www.modelscope.cn/mcp/servers/@antvis/mcp-server-chart), [glama.ai](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/@antvis/mcp-server-chart), [smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/server/@antvis/mcp-server-chart) or others with HTTP, SSE Protocol.\n\n## 🚰 Run with SSE or Streamable transport\n\n### Run directly\n\nInstall the package globally.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @antv/mcp-server-chart\n```\n\nRun the server with your preferred transport option:\n\n```bash\n# For SSE transport (default endpoint: /sse)\nmcp-server-chart --transport sse\n\n# For Streamable transport with custom endpoint\nmcp-server-chart --transport streamable\n```\n\nThen you can access the server at:\n\n- SSE transport: `http://localhost:1122/sse`\n- Streamable transport: `http://localhost:1122/mcp`\n\n### Docker deploy\n\nEnter the docker directory.\n\n```bash\ncd docker\n```\n\nDeploy using docker-compose.\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nThen you can access the server at:\n\n- SSE transport: `http://localhost:1123/sse`\n- Streamable transport: `http://localhost:1122/mcp`\n\n## 🎮 CLI Options\n\nYou can also use the following CLI options when running the MCP server. Command options by run cli with `-H`.\n\n```plain\nMCP Server Chart CLI\n\nOptions:\n  --transport, -t  Specify the transport protocol: \"stdio\", \"sse\", or \"streamable\" (default: \"stdio\")\n  --host, -h       Specify the host for SSE or streamable transport (default: localhost)\n  --port, -p       Specify the port for SSE or streamable transport (default: 1122)\n  --endpoint, -e   Specify the endpoint for the transport:\n                   - For SSE: default is \"/sse\"\n                   - For streamable: default is \"/mcp\"\n  --help, -H       Show this help message\n```\n\n## ⚙️ Environment Variables\n\n| Variable             | Description                                                | Default                                      | Example                                       |\n| -------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| `VIS_REQUEST_SERVER` | Custom chart generation service URL for private deployment | `https://antv-studio.alipay.com/api/gpt-vis` | `https://your-server.com/api/chart`           |\n| `SERVICE_ID`         | Service identifier for chart generation records            | -                                            | `your-service-id-123`                         |\n| `DISABLED_TOOLS`     | Comma-separated list of tool names to disable              | -                                            | `generate_fishbone_diagram,generate_mind_map` |\n\n### 📠 Private Deployment\n\n`MCP Server Chart` provides a free chart generation service by default. For users with a need for private deployment, they can try using `VIS_REQUEST_SERVER` to customize their own chart generation service.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-server-chart\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@antv/mcp-server-chart\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"VIS_REQUEST_SERVER\": \"<YOUR_VIS_REQUEST_SERVER>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can use AntV's project [GPT-Vis-SSR](https://github.com/antvis/GPT-Vis/tree/main/bindings/gpt-vis-ssr) to deploy an HTTP service in a private environment, and then pass the URL address through env `VIS_REQUEST_SERVER`.\n\n- **Method**: `POST`\n- **Parameter**: Which will be passed to `GPT-Vis-SSR` for rendering. Such as, `{ \"type\": \"line\", \"data\": [{ \"time\": \"2025-05\", \"value\": 512 }, { \"time\": \"2025-06\", \"value\": 1024 }] }`.\n- **Return**: The return object of HTTP service.\n  - **success**: `boolean` Whether generate chart image successfully.\n  - **resultObj**: `string` The chart image url.\n  - **errorMessage**: `string` When `success = false`, return the error message.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The private deployment solution currently does not support geographic visualization chart generation include 3 tools: `geographic-district-map`, `geographic-path-map`, `geographic-pin-map`.\n\n### 🗺️ Generate Records\n\nBy default, users are required to save the results themselves, but we also provide a service for viewing the chart generation records, which requires users to generate a service identifier for themselves and configure it.\n\nUse Alipay to scan and open the mini program to generate a personal service identifier (click the \"My\" menu below, enter the \"My Services\" page, click the \"Generate\" button, and click the \"Copy\" button after success):\n\n<img alt=\"my service identifier website\" width=\"240\" src=\"https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_dxq8v0/afts/img/dASoTLt6EywAAAAARqAAAAgADu43AQFr/fmt.webp\" />\n\nNext, you need to add the `SERVICE_ID` environment variable to the MCP server configuration. For example, the configuration for Mac is as follows (for Windows systems, just add the `env` variable):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"AntV Map\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@antv/mcp-server-chart\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"SERVICE_ID\": \"***********************************\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAfter updating the MCP Server configuration, you need to restart your AI client application and check again whether you have started and connected to the MCP Server successfully. Then you can try to generate the map again. After the generation is successful, you can go to the \"My Map\" page of the mini program to view your map generation records.\n\n<img alt=\"my map records website\" width=\"240\" src=\"https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_dxq8v0/afts/img/RacFR7emR3QAAAAAUkAAAAgADu43AQFr/original\" />\n\n### 🎛️ Tool Filtering\n\nYou can disable specific chart generation tools using the `DISABLED_TOOLS` environment variable. This is useful when certain tools have compatibility issues with your MCP client or when you want to limit the available functionality.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"mcp-server-chart\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@antv/mcp-server-chart\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"DISABLED_TOOLS\": \"generate_fishbone_diagram,generate_mind_map\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Available tool names for filtering** See the [✨ Features](#-features).\n\n## 🔨 Development\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nBuild the server:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nStart the MCP server:\n\n```bash\nnpm run start\n```\n\nStart the MCP server with SSE transport:\n\n```bash\nnode build/index.js -t sse\n```\n\nStart the MCP server with Streamable transport:\n\n```bash\nnode build/index.js -t streamable\n```\n\n## 📄 License\n\nMIT@[AntV](https://github.com/antvis).\n",

In addition, it removes the need\nto run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support\nopen-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to\nmultiple open-source or commercial back-ends.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.\n- Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.\n- Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.\n- Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.\n- Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.\n\n## Community\n\nThe OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the [#otel-collector](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W)\nchannel on the CNCF Slack and [meets once a week](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs) via\nvideo calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:\n\n- meet the humans behind the project\n- get an opinion about specific proposals\n- look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack\n- get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously\n\nWe rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to\nallow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:\n\nTuesday:\n\n- [17:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700)\n\nWednesday:\n\n- [09:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900)\n- [05:00 PT](https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500)\n\nContributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points.\nPost a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong\nreasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to\nidentify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.\n\nRemember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the\nrelevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull\nrequest where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous\ncalls and don't want them to feel excluded.\n\n## Supported OTLP version\n\nThis code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0,\nconsidered Stable. [See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability\ndefinition\nhere.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition)\n\n## Stability levels\n\nSee [Stability Levels and versioning](docs/component-stability.md) for more details.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nWhen used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).\nRemoving support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.\n\nSupport for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:\n\n1. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.\n2. The first release after the release of a new Go minor version `N` will remove support for Go version `N-2`.\n\nOfficial OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.\n\n## Verifying the images signatures\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To verify a signed artifact or blob, first [install Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/), then follow the instructions below.\n\nWe are signing the images `otel/opentelemetry-collector` and `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` using [sigstore cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:\n\n```console\n$ cosign verify \\\n  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/<RELEASE_TAG> \\\n  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \\\n  <OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE>\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n- `<RELEASE_TAG>`: is the release that you want to validate\n- `<OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE>`: is the image that you want to check\n\nExample:\n\n```console\n$ cosign verify --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/v0.98.0 --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0\n\nVerification for ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.98.0 --\nThe following checks were performed on each of these signatures:\n  - The cosign claims were validated\n  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline\n  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates\n\n[{\"critical\":{\"identity\":{\"docker-reference\":\"ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/opentelemetry-collector-contrib\"},\"image\":{\"docker-manifest-digest\":\"sha256:5cea85bcbc734a3c0a641368e5a4ea9d31b472997e9f2feca57eeb4a147fcf1a\"},\"type\":\"cosign

Must be placed manually into web browsers; the Chromium and Thunderbird versions usually won't auto-update.\n\n***\n\nuBlock Origin (uBO) is a CPU and memory-efficient [wide-spectrum content blocker][Blocking] for Chromium and Firefox. It blocks ads, trackers, coin miners, popups, annoying anti-blockers, malware sites, etc., by default using [EasyList][EasyList], [EasyPrivacy][EasyPrivacy], [Peter Lowe's Blocklist][Peter Lowe's Blocklist], [Online Malicious URL Blocklist][Malicious Blocklist], and uBO [filter lists][uBO Filters]. There are many other lists available to block even more. Hosts files are also supported. uBO uses the EasyList filter syntax and [extends][Extended Syntax] the syntax to work with custom rules and filters.\n\nYou may easily unselect any preselected filter lists if you think uBO blocks too much. For reference, Adblock Plus installs with only EasyList, ABP filters, and Acceptable Ads enabled by default.\n\nIt is important to note that using a blocker is **NOT** [theft]. Do not fall for this creepy idea. The _ultimate_ logical consequence of `blocking = theft` is the criminalization of the inalienable right to privacy.\n\nAds, \"unintrusive\" or not, are just the visible portion of the privacy-invading means entering your browser when you visit most sites. **uBO's primary goal is to help users neutralize these privacy-invading methods** in a way that welcomes those users who do not wish to use more technical means.\n\n***\n\n* [Documentation](#documentation)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n  * [Firefox](#firefox)\n  * [Thunderbird](#thunderbird)\n  * [Chromium](#chromium)\n  * [All Programs](#all-programs)\n  * [Enterprise Deployment](#enterprise-deployment)\n* [Release History](#release-history)\n* [Translations](#translations)\n* [About](#about)\n\n## Documentation\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Basic Mode</th>\n            <th>Advanced Mode</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>The <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface\">simple popup user interface</a> for an install-it-and-forget-it type of installation that is configured optimally by default.</td>\n            <td>The <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide\">advanced popup user interface</a> includes a point-and-click firewall that is configurable on a per-site basis.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/585534/232531044-c4ac4dd5-0b60-4c1e-aabb-914be04b846c.png\"/></a></td>\n            <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"><a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/585534/232531439-a8f81cc3-6622-45c4-8b32-7348cecf6e98.png\"/></a></td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nVisit the [Wiki][Wiki] for documentation.\n\nFor support, questions, or help, visit [/r/uBlockOrigin][Reddit].\n\n## Installation\n\n[Required Permissions][Permissions]\n\n#### Firefox\n\n[Firefox Add-ons][Mozilla]\n\n[Development Builds][Beta]\n\nuBO [works best][Works Best] on Firefox and is available for desktop and Android versions.\n\n#### Thunderbird\n\n[Thunderbird Add-ons][Thunderbird]\n\nIn Thunderbird, uBlock Origin does not affect emails, just feeds.\n\n#### Chromium\n\n[Chrome Web Store][Chrome]\n\n[Microsoft Edge Add-ons][Edge] (Published by [Nicole Rolls][Nicole Rolls] until version 1.62.

It is developed to meet the needs of modern web platforms for viewing and sharing media. It can be used to build a small to medium video and media portal within minutes.\n\nIt is built mostly using the modern stack Django + React and includes a REST API.\n\nA demo is available at https://demo.mediacms.io\n\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediacms-io/mediacms/main/docs/images/index.jpg\" width=\"340\">\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediacms-io/mediacms/main/docs/images/video.jpg\" width=\"340\">\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediacms-io/mediacms/main/docs/images/embed.jpg\" width=\"340\">\n</p>\n\n## Features\n- **Complete control over your data**: host it yourself!\n- **Modern technologies**: Django/Python/Celery, React.\n- **Support for multiple publishing workflows**: public, private, unlisted and custom\n- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: create RBAC categories and connect users to groups with view/edit access on their media\n- **Automatic transcription**: through integration with Whisper running locally\n- **Multiple media types support**: video, audio,  image, pdf\n- **Multiple media classification options**: categories, tags and custom\n- **Multiple media sharing options**: social media share, videos embed code generation\n- **Video Trimmer**: trim video, replace, save as new or create segments\n- **SAML support**: with ability to add mappings to system roles and groups\n- **Easy media searching**: enriched with live search functionality\n- **Playlists for audio and video content**: create playlists, add and reorder content\n- **Responsive design**: including light and dark themes\n- **Advanced users management**: allow self registration, invite only, closed.\n- **Configurable actions**: allow download, add comments, add likes, dislikes, report media\n- **Configuration options**: change logos, fonts, styling, add more pages\n- **Enhanced video player**: customized video.js player with multiple resolution and playback speed options\n- **Multiple transcoding profiles**: sane defaults for multiple dimensions (144p, 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p) and multiple profiles (h264, h265, vp9)\n- **Adaptive video streaming**: possible through HLS protocol\n- **Subtitles/CC**: support for multilingual subtitle files\n- **Scalable transcoding**: transcoding through priorities. Experimental support for remote workers\n- **Chunked file uploads**: for pausable/resumable upload of content\n- **REST API**: Documented through Swagger\n- **Translation**: Most of the CMS is translated to a number of languages\n\n## Example cases\n\n- **Universities, schools, education.** Administrators and editors keep what content will be published, students are not distracted with advertisements and irrelevant content, plus they have the ability to select either to stream or download content.\n- **Organization sensitive content.** In cases where content is sensitive and cannot be uploaded to external sites.\n- **Build a great community.** MediaCMS can be customized (URLs, logos, fonts, aesthetics) so that you create a highly customized video portal for your community!\n- **Personal portal.** Organize, categorize and host your content the way you prefer.\n\n\n## Philosophy\n\nWe believe there's a need for quality open source web applications that can be used to build community portals and support collaboration.\nWe have three goals for MediaCMS: a) deliver all functionality one would expect from a modern system, b) allow for easy installation and maintenance, c) allow easy customization and addition of features.\n\n\n## License\n\nMediaCMS is released under [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 license](LICENSE.txt).\nCopyright Markos Gogoulos.\n\n\n## Support and paid services\n\nWe provide custom installations, development of extra functionality, migration from existing systems, integrations with legacy systems, training and support. Checkout our [services page](https://mediacms.io/#services/) for more information.\n\n### Commercial Hostings\n**Elestio**\n\nYou can deploy MediaCMS on Elestio using one-click deployment. Elestio supports MediaCMS by providing revenue share so go ahead and click below to deploy and use MediaCMS.\n\n[![Deploy on Elestio](https://elest.io/images/logos/deploy-to-elestio-btn.png)](https://elest.io/open-source/mediacms)\n\n## Hardware considerations\n\nFor a small to medium installation, with a few hours of video uploaded daily, and a few hundreds of active daily users viewing content, 4GB Ram / 2-4 CPUs as minimum is ok. For a larger installation with many hours of video uploaded daily, consider adding more CPUs and more Ram.\n\nIn terms of disk space, think of what the needs will be. A general rule is to multiply by three the size of the expected uploaded videos (since the system keeps original versions, encoded versions plus HLS), so if you receive 1G of videos daily and maintain all of them, you should consider a 1T disk across a year (1G * 3 * 365).\n\nIn order to support automatic transcriptions through Whisper, consider more CPUs.\n\n## Installation / Maintanance\n\nThere are two ways to run MediaCMS, through Docker Compose and through installing it on a server via an automation script that installs and configures all needed services. Find the related pages:\n\n- [Single Server](docs/admins_docs.md#2-server-installation) page\n- [Docker Compose](docs/admins_docs.md#3-docker-installation) page\n\n  A complete guide can be found on the blog post [How to self-host and share your videos in 2021](https://medium.com/@MediaCMS.io/how-to-self-host-and-share-your-videos-in-2021-14067e3b291b).\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Users documentation](docs/user_docs.md) page\n* [Administrators documentation](docs/admins_docs.md) page\n* [Developers documentation](docs/developers_docs.md) page\n* [Configuration](docs/admins_docs.md#5-configuration) page\n* [Transcoding](docs/transcoding.md) page\n* [Developer Experience](docs/dev_exp.md) page\n* [Media Permissions](docs/media_permissions.md) page\n\n\n## Technology\n\nThis software uses the following list of awesome technologies: Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, uWSGI, React, Fine Uploader, video.js, FFMPEG, Bento4\n\n\n## Who is using it\n- **Multiple Universities** for hosting educational videos\n- **Cinemata** non-profit media, technology and culture organization - https://cinemata.org\n- **Critical Commons** public media archive and fair use advocacy network - https://criticalcommons.org\n- **American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists** - https://surgeryu.org/\n\n\n## How to contribute\n\nIf you like the project, here's a few things you can do\n- Hire us, for custom installations, training, support, maintenance work\n- Suggest us to others that are interested to hire us\n- Write a blog post/article about MediaCMS\n- Share on social media about the project\n- Open issues, participate on [discussions](https://github.com/mediacms-io/mediacms/discussions), report bugs, suggest ideas\n- [Show and tell](https://github.com/mediacms-io/mediacms/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) how you are using the project\n- Star the project\n- Add functionality, work on a PR, fix an issue!\n\n\n## Contact\n\ninfo@mediacms.io\n",

It works on _Linux_, _Windows_, and _macOS_.\n\n![screenshot](assets/screenshot-debian-600.jpg)\n\nIt focuses on:\n\n - **lightness**: native, displays only the device screen\n - **performance**: 30~120fps, depending on the device\n - **quality**: 1920×1080 or above\n - **low latency**: [35~70ms][lowlatency]\n - **low startup time**: ~1 second to display the first image\n - **non-intrusiveness**: nothing is left installed on the Android device\n - **user benefits**: no account, no ads, no internet required\n - **freedom**: free and open source software\n\n[lowlatency]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/pull/646\n\nIts features include:\n - [audio forwarding](doc/audio.md) (Android 11+)\n - [recording](doc/recording.md)\n - [virtual display](doc/virtual_display.md)\n - mirroring with [Android device screen off](doc/device.md#turn-screen-off)\n - [copy-paste](doc/control.md#copy-paste) in both directions\n - [configurable quality](doc/video.md)\n - [camera mirroring](doc/camera.md) (Android 12+)\n - [mirroring as a webcam (V4L2)](doc/v4l2.md) (Linux-only)\n - physical [keyboard][hid-keyboard] and [mouse][hid-mouse] simulation (HID)\n - [gamepad](doc/gamepad.md) support\n - [OTG mode](doc/otg.md)\n - and more…\n\n[hid-keyboard]: doc/keyboard.md#physical-keyboard-simulation\n[hid-mouse]: doc/mouse.md#physical-mouse-simulation\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThe Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).\n\n[Audio forwarding](doc/audio.md) is supported for API >= 30 (Android 11+).\n\nMake sure you [enabled USB debugging][enable-adb] on your device(s).\n\n[enable-adb]: https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable\n\nOn some devices (especially Xiaomi), you might get the following error:\n\n```\nInjecting input events requires the caller (or the source of the instrumentation, if any) to have the INJECT_EVENTS permission.\n```\n\nIn that case, you need to enable [an additional option][control] `USB debugging\n(Security Settings)` (this is an item different from `USB debugging`) to control\nit using a keyboard and mouse. Rebooting the device is necessary once this\noption is set.\n\n[control]: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/70#issuecomment-373286323\n\nNote that USB debugging is not required to run scrcpy in [OTG mode](doc/otg.md).\n\n\n## Get the app\n\n - [Linux](doc/linux.md)\n - [Windows](doc/windows.md) (read [how to run](doc/windows.md#run))\n - [macOS](doc/macos.md)\n\n\n## Must-know tips\n\n - [Reducing resolution](doc/video.md#size) may greatly improve performance\n   (`scrcpy -m1024`)\n - [_Right-click_](doc/mouse.md#mouse-bindings) triggers `BACK`\n - [_Middle-click_](doc/mouse.md#mouse-bindings) triggers `HOME`\n - <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> toggles [fullscreen](doc/window.md#fullscreen)\n - There are many other [shortcuts](doc/shortcuts.md)\n\n\n## Usage examples\n\nThere are a lot of options, [documented](#user-documentation) in separate pages.\nHere are just some common examples.\n\n - Capture the screen in H.265 (better quality), limit the size to 1920, limit\n   the frame rate to 60fps, disable audio, and control the device by simulating\n   a physical keyboard:\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --video-codec=h265 --max-size=1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio --keyboard=uhid\n    scrcpy --video-codec=h265 -m1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio -K  # short version\n    ```\n\n - Start VLC in a new virtual display (separate from the device display):\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --new-display=1920x1080 --start-app=org.videolan.vlc\n    ```\n\n - Record the device camera in H.265 at 1920x1080 (and microphone) to an MP4\n   file:\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --video-source=camera --video-codec=h265 --camera-size=1920x1080 --record=file.mp4\n    ```\n\n - Capture the device front camera and expose it as a webcam on the computer (on\n   Linux):\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --video-source=camera --camera-size=1920x1080 --camera-facing=front --v4l2-sink=/dev/video2 --no-playback\n    ```\n\n - Control the device without mirroring by simulating a physical keyboard and\n   mouse (USB debugging not required):\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --otg\n    ```\n\n - Control the device using gamepad controllers plugged into the computer:\n\n    ```bash\n    scrcpy --gamepad=uhid\n    scrcpy -G  # short version\n    ```\n\n## User documentation\n\nThe application provides a lot of features and configuration options.

Please consider donating on [Github](https://github.com/sponsors/Fredolx), [Paypal](https://paypal.me/fredolx) or directly by [crypto](#donate-crypto-thank-you)\nI've been developing and maintaining this project alone and for entirely for free over the past 2 years. I am in dire need of support to continue developing this project. I've never added annoying donation pop-ups or anything of the sort to make sure you have the fastest and cleanest IPTV experience and I'm committed to keep this project FREE & OPEN-SOURCE. To keep that commitment, I need your support!\n\n![Image of the app](https://github.com/Fredolx/open-tv/blob/main/screenshots/demo1.png)\n\n## Features:\n- Import your IPTV channels from any source (M3U File, M3U link, Xtream) 🗃️\n- Record while watching 🎥\n- Multi IPTV sources 🎊\n- Control the UI from a TV remote 📺\n- Super low RAM usage, crazy speeds, and instant search 🚅\n- Refresh your sources when you need it 🔄\n- Add channels to favorites 🌟\n- Make your own custom channels\n- Share your custom channels with friends\n- Re-stream channels to friends or other devices (phone, tv)\n\n## Prerequisites\nIf you are on Windows or use the flatpak on Linux; SKIP THIS PART. \n\nThe app depends on mpv, ffmpeg and yt-dlp. \nIf you are on MacOS, you must use Brew or MacPorts to install those dependencies. \n\nOn Fedora, you must add rpmfusion to install those packages.\n\nOn Debian or LTS distro, I would strongly suggest using a backport for yt-dlp.\n\nThe Windows build **comes with mpv included** (.msi), but you can still install mpv from a package manager of your choice to always have the latest version installed\n\n```\nbrew install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #MacOS\nsudo dnf install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #Fedora\nsudo zypper install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #OpenSUSE\nsudo pacman -Syu mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #Arch\nsudo apt install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp #Debian/Ubuntu\nscoop install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp # Windows\nchoco install mpv ffmpeg yt-dlp # Windows alternative\n```\n\n## Feedback\nFeel free to submit any kind of feedback by creating a new issue.\n\n## Hotkeys\n* F1: Help\n* Ctrl + a: Show all channels\n* Ctrl + s: Show categories\n* Ctrl + d: Show favorites\n* Ctrl + f: Search\n* Ctrl + q: Enable/Disable livestreams\n* Ctrl + w: Enable/Disable movies\n* Ctrl + e: Enable/Disable series\n* Backspace/Esc: Go back\n* Arrow keys/Tab/Shift+Tab: Navigation\n\nIf you have a tv remote or air mouse that has slightly different bindings for general nav (back, up, down, left, right),\nplease open an issue and I will add them if it's feasible. Otherwise, you can still use hwdb to make them match OpenTV's bindings.\n\n## Settings explained\n\n**Stream Caching**\n\nWhy enabling:\n  - If you have a slow internet connection/IPTV provider causing the stream to pause often\n\nWhy disabling: \n  - If the stream often drops completely. It will prevent the stream from jumping too far ahead/behind\n  - If you have a good internet/provider and want lower latency\n  - Can prevent some weird bugs/slowdowns\n\n## Donate Crypto (Thank you!)\nBTC:\n```\nbc1q7v27u4mrxhtqzl97pcp4vl52npss760epsheu3\n```\n\nETH:\n```\n0x171D5B628eff75c98c141aD5584FffA209274365\n```\n\nLTC:\n```\nltc1qzxgp2grt9ayvpv0dur7lgzgf88yp09h2ytmga0\n```\n\nBCH:\n```\nbitcoincash:qz4mauqyytkvhp9yze0qhgn2nnlv4z5glckyysxg2n\n```\n\nSOL:\n```\nAM7roSrxBKrS5mG7q6aXnQHZKh3ArtBxvG3x1B1VjKhj\n```\n\nBNB:\n```\n0x0C8C5217a8044b3736aD82CCFB9f099597b65253\n```\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nOpen TV is an independent open-source project created to provide a fast and powerful IPTV experience.

      "readme": "<h1><img src=\"https://img.fortawesome.com/349cfdf6/fa-free-logo.svg\" alt=\"Font Awesome Free\" width=\"50%\"></h1>\n\n> Version 7\n\nFont Awesome is the Internet's icon library and toolkit, used by millions of\ndesigners, developers, and content creators.\n\n## Documentation\n\nLearn how to get started with Font Awesome and then dive deeper into other and advanced topics:\n\n[Docs for version 7](https://fontawesome.com/docs)\n\n### Where did Font Awesome 6, 5, 4 (or 3) go?\n\nNow that Font Awesome 7 has been released we are marking version 6 as Long Term\nSupport (LTS). Version 6 will get critical bug fixes only. Version 3, 4, and 5 are\nnow end-of-life and we don't plan on releasing any further versions of these.\n\nYou can see a complete list of versions on [our Versions\npage](https://fontawesome.com/versions).\n\n## Change log\n\nThe change log for releases is now [available directly on our site](https://fontawesome.com/docs/changelog/).\n\nLooking for older versions of Font Awesome? Check the [releases](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases).\n\n## Upgrading\n\nFrom time-to-time we'll have special upgrading instructions from one version to the next.\n\n- [Web upgrading guide](https://docs.fontawesome.com/upgrade/upgrade-on-web)\n- [Desktop upgrading guide](https://docs.fontawesome.com/upgrade/upgrade-on-desktop)\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nWe will behave ourselves if you behave yourselves. For more details see our\n[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read through our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  Included\nare directions for opening issues.\n\n## Versioning\n\nFont Awesome will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered\nwith the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit https://semver.org.\n\n**The major version \"7\" is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore\nwe deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**\n\n* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing\n  icon\n* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks\n  backward compatibility\n* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will\n  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md\n* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons\n* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward\n  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases\n\n## License\n\nFont Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for\ncommercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.\n\n- Icons — CC BY 4.0 License\n  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons packaged as .svg and .js files types.\n- Fonts — SIL OFL 1.1 License\n  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OFL license applies to all icons packaged as web and desktop font files.\n- Code — MIT License\n  - In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and non-icon files.\n\nAttribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font\nAwesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient\nattribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these\nfiles normally.\n\nWe've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work\nto remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to\nlearn about Font Awesome.\n\n## Team\n\nhttps://github.com/orgs/FortAwesome/people\n",

Built with a modern plugin architecture, it provides a comprehensive set of self-contained tools organized into workflow-based directories, plus MCP resources for efficient data access, enabling programmatic interaction with Xcode projects, simulators, devices, and Swift packages through a standardized interface.\n\n![xcodebuildmcp2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8961d5db-f7ed-4e60-bbb8-48bfd0bc1353)\n<caption>Using Cursor to build, install, and launch an app on the iOS simulator while capturing logs at run-time.</caption>\n\n## Why?\n\nThe XcodeBuild MCP tool exists primarily to streamline and standardise interaction between AI agents and Xcode projects. By providing dedicated tools for common Xcode operations, it removes reliance on manual or potentially incorrect command-line invocations.\n\nThis ensures a reliable and efficient development process, allowing agents to seamlessly leverage Xcode's capabilities while reducing the risk of configuration errors.\n\nCritically, this MCP enables AI agents to independently validate code changes by building projects, inspecting errors, and iterating autonomously. In contrast to user-driven tools like Sweetpad, XcodeBuild MCP empowers agents to automate these workflows effectively.\n\n## Features\n\nThe XcodeBuildMCP server provides the following tool capabilities:\n\n### Xcode project management\n- **Discover Projects**: Xcode projects and workspaces discovery\n- **Build Operations**: Platform-specific build tools for macOS, iOS simulator, and iOS device targets\n- **Project Information**: Tools to list schemes and show build settings for Xcode projects and workspaces\n- **Clean Operations**: Clean build products using xcodebuild's native clean action\n- **Incremental build support**: Lightning fast builds using incremental build support (experimental, opt-in required)\n- **Project Scaffolding**: Create new iOS and macOS projects from modern templates with workspace + SPM package architecture, customizable bundle identifiers, deployment targets, and device families\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n- **Build Packages**: Build Swift packages with configuration and architecture options\n- **Run Tests**: Execute Swift package test suites with filtering and parallel execution\n- **Run Executables**: Execute package binaries with timeout handling and background execution support\n- **Process Management**: List and stop long-running executables started with Swift Package tools\n- **Clean Artifacts**: Remove build artifacts and derived data for fresh builds\n\n### Simulator management\n- **Simulator Control**: List, boot, and open simulators\n- **App Lifecycle**: Complete app management - install, launch, and stop apps on simulators\n- **Log Capture**: Capture run-time logs from a simulator\n- **UI Automation**: Interact with simulator UI elements\n- **Screenshot**: Capture screenshots from a simulator\n- **Video Capture**: Start/stop simulator video capture to MP4 (AXe v1.1.0+)\n\n### Device management\n- **Device Discovery**: List connected physical Apple devices over USB or Wi-Fi\n- **App Lifecycle**: Complete app management - build, install, launch, and stop apps on physical devices\n- **Testing**: Run test suites on physical devices with detailed results and cross-platform support\n- **Log Capture**: Capture console output from apps running on physical Apple devices\n- **Wireless Connectivity**: Support for devices connected over Wi-Fi networks\n\n### App utilities\n- **Bundle ID Extraction**: Extract bundle identifiers from app bundles across all Apple platforms\n- **App Lifecycle Management**: Complete app lifecycle control across all platforms\n  - Launch apps on simulators, physical devices, and macOS\n  - Stop running apps with process ID or bundle ID management\n  - Process monitoring and control for comprehensive app management\n\n### MCP Resources\n\nFor clients that support MCP resources XcodeBuildMCP provides efficient URI-based data access:\n\n- **Simulators Resource** (`xcodebuildmcp://simulators`): Direct access to available iOS simulators with UUIDs and states\n- **Devices Resource** (`xcodebuildmcp://devices`): Direct access to connected physical Apple devices with UDIDs and states\n- **Doctor Resource** (`xcodebuildmcp://doctor`): Direct access to environment information such as Xcode version, macOS version, and Node.js version\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- macOS 14.5 or later\n- Xcode 16.x or later\n- Node 18.x or later\n\n> Video capture requires the bundled AXe binary (v1.1.0+). Run `npm run bundle:axe` once locally before using `record_sim_video`. This is not required for unit tests.\n\nConfigure your MCP client\n\n#### One click install\n\nFor a quick install, you can use the following links:\n\n[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=XcodeBuildMCP&config=eyJ0eXBlIjoic3RkaW8iLCJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IHhjb2RlYnVpbGRtY3BAbGF0ZXN0IiwiZW52Ijp7IklOQ1JFTUVOVEFMX0JVSUxEU19FTkFCTEVEIjoiZmFsc2UiLCJYQ09ERUJVSUxETUNQX1NFTlRSWV9ESVNBQkxFRCI6ImZhbHNlIn19)\n\n[<img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-VS_Code?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=0098FF\" alt=\"Install in VS Code\">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=XcodeBuildMCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22xcodebuildmcp%40latest%22%5D%7D)\n\n[<img alt=\"Install in VS Code Insiders\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5\">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=XcodeBuildMCP&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22-y%22%2C%22xcodebuildmcp%40latest%22%5D%7D&quality=insiders)\n\n#### General installation\n\nMost MCP clients (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Claude Desktop etc) have standardised on the following JSON configuration format, just add the the following to your client's JSON configuration's `mcpServers` object:\n\n```json\n\"XcodeBuildMCP\": {\n  \"command\": \"npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"-y\",\n    \"xcodebuildmcp@latest\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Specific client installation instructions\n\n##### OpenAI Codex CLI\n\nCodex uses a toml configuration file to configure MCP servers. To configure XcodeBuildMCP with [OpenAI's Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), add the following configuration to your Codex CLI config file:\n\n```toml\n[mcp_servers.XcodeBuildMCP]\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"-y\", \"xcodebuildmcp@latest\"]\nenv = { \"INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED\" = \"false\", \"XCODEBUILDMCP_SENTRY_DISABLED\" = \"false\" }\n```\n\nIf you see tool calls timing out in Codex (for example, `timed out awaiting tools/call after 60s`), increase the Codex tool timeout in your config:\n\n```toml\ntool_timeout_sec = 600\n```\n\nFor more information see [OpenAI Codex MCP Server Configuration](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/config.md#connecting-to-mcp-servers) documentation.\n\n##### Claude Code CLI\n\nTo use XcodeBuildMCP with [Claude Code](https://code.anthropic.com), you can add it via the command line:\n\n```bash\n# Add XcodeBuildMCP server to Claude Code\nclaude mcp add XcodeBuildMCP npx xcodebuildmcp@latest\n\n# Or with environment variables\nclaude mcp add XcodeBuildMCP npx xcodebuildmcp@latest -e INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED=false -e XCODEBUILDMCP_SENTRY_DISABLED=false\n```\n\n##### Smithery\n\nXcodeBuildMCP runs as a local (stdio) server when installed via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP). You can configure it in the Smithery session UI or via environment variables.\n\n```bash\n# Claude Desktop / Claude Code\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP --client claude\n\n# Cursor\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP --client cursor\n\n# VS Code\nnpx -y @smithery/cli install @cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP --client vscode\n```\n\nIf your client isn't listed, run `npx smithery install --help` to see supported values for `--client`.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Please note that XcodeBuildMCP will request xcodebuild to skip macro validation. This is to avoid errors when building projects that use Swift Macros.\n\n#### MCP Compatibility\n\nXcodeBuildMCP supports both MCP tools, resources and sampling. At time of writing the following editors have varying levels of MCP feature support:\n\n| Editor | Tools | Resources | Samplng |\n|--------|-------|-----------|---------|\n| **VS Code** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| **Cursor** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Windsurf** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Claude Code** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\n| **Claude Desktop** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\n\n## Incremental build support\n\nXcodeBuildMCP includes experimental support for incremental builds. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`:\n\nTo enable incremental builds, set the `INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`:\n\nExample MCP configuration:\n```json\n\"XcodeBuildMCP\": {\n  ...\n  \"env\": {\n    \"INCREMENTAL_BUILDS_ENABLED\": \"true\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Please note that incremental builds support is currently highly experimental and your mileage may vary. Please report any issues you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cameroncooke/XcodeBuildMCP/issues).\n\n## Workflow Selection\n\nBy default, XcodeBuildMCP loads all tools at startup. If you want a smaller tool surface for a specific workflow, set `XCODEBUILDMCP_ENABLED_WORKFLOWS` to a comma-separated list of workflow directory names. The `session-management` workflow is always auto-included since other tools depend on it.\n\nExample MCP client configuration:\n```json\n\"XcodeBuildMCP\": {\n  ...\n  \"env\": {\n    \"XCODEBUILDMCP_ENABLED_WORKFLOWS\": \"simulator,device,project-discovery\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Available Workflows:**\n- `device` (7 tools) - iOS Device Development\n- `simulator` (12 tools) - iOS Simulator Development\n- `simulator-management` (5 tools) - Simulator Management\n- `swift-package` (6 tools) - Swift Package Manager\n- `project-discovery` (5 tools) - Project Discovery\n- `macos` (6 tools) - macOS Development\n- `ui-testing` (11 tools) - UI Testing & Automation\n- `logging` (4 tools) - Log Capture & Management\n- `project-scaffolding` (2 tools) - Project Scaffolding\n- `utilities` (1 tool) - Project Utilities\n- `doctor` (1 tool) - System Doctor\n\n## Session-aware opt-out\n\nBy default, XcodeBuildMCP uses a session-aware mode: the LLM (or client) sets shared defaults once (simulator, device, project/workspace, scheme, etc.), and all tools reuse them—similar to choosing a scheme and simulator in Xcode’s UI so you don’t repeat them on every action. This cuts context bloat not just in each call payload, but also in the tool schemas themselves (those parameters don’t have to be described on every tool).\n\nIf you prefer the older, explicit style where each tool requires its own parameters, set `XCODEBUILDMCP_DISABLE_SESSION_DEFAULTS=true`. This restores the legacy schemas with per-call parameters while still honoring any session defaults you choose to set.\n\nExample MCP client configuration:\n```json\n\"XcodeBuildMCP\": {\n  ...\n  \"env\": {\n    \"XCODEBUILDMCP_DISABLE_SESSION_DEFAULTS\": \"true\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLeave this unset for the streamlined session-aware experience; enable it to force explicit parameters on each tool call.\n\n## Code Signing for Device Deployment\n\nFor device deployment features to work, code signing must be properly configured in Xcode **before** using XcodeBuildMCP device tools:\n\n1. Open your project in Xcode\n2. Select your project target\n3. Go to \"Signing & Capabilities\" tab\n4. Configure \"Automatically manage signing\" and select your development team\n5. Ensure a valid provisioning profile is selected\n\n> **Note**: XcodeBuildMCP cannot configure code signing automatically. This initial setup must be done once in Xcode, after which the MCP device tools can build, install, and test apps on physical devices.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues with XcodeBuildMCP, the doctor tool can help identify the problem by providing detailed information about your environment and dependencies.\n\n### Doctor Tool\n\nThe doctor tool is a standalone utility that checks your system configuration and reports on the status of all dependencies required by XcodeBuildMCP. It's particularly useful when reporting issues.\n\n```bash\n# Run the doctor tool using npx\nnpx --package xcodebuildmcp@latest xcodebuildmcp-doctor\n```\n\nThe doctor tool will output comprehensive information about:\n\n- System and Node.js environment\n- Xcode installation and configuration\n- Required dependencies (xcodebuild, AXe, etc.)\n- Environment variables affecting XcodeBuildMCP\n- Feature availability status\n\nWhen reporting issues on GitHub, please include the full output from the doctor tool to help with troubleshooting.\n\n## Privacy\n\nThis project uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error monitoring and diagnostics. Sentry helps us track issues, crashes, and unexpected errors to improve the reliability and stability of XcodeBuildMCP.\n\n### What is sent to Sentry?\n- Only error-level logs and diagnostic information are sent to Sentry by default.\n- Error logs may include details such as error messages, stack traces, and (in some cases) file paths or project names. You can review the sources in this repository to see exactly what is logged.\n\n### Opting Out of Sentry\n- If you do not wish to send error logs to Sentry, you can opt out by setting the environment variable `XCODEBUILDMCP_SENTRY_DISABLED=true`.\n\nExample MCP client configuration:\n```json\n\"XcodeBuildMCP\": {\n  ...\n  \"env\": {\n    \"XCODEBUILDMCP_SENTRY_DISABLED\": \"true\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Demos\n\n### Autonomously fixing build errors in Cursor\n![xcodebuildmcp3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/173e6450-8743-4379-a76c-de2dd2b678a3)\n\n### Utilising the new UI automation and screen capture features\n\n![xcodebuildmcp4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17300a18-f47a-428a-aad3-dc094859c1b2)\n\n### Building and running iOS app in Claude Desktop\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c08d75-8be6-4857-b4d0-9350b26ef086\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-5.x-blue.svg)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) [![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/node->=18.x-brightgreen.svg)](https://nodejs.org/)\n\nContributions are welcome!

They store a lot of your personal data - ranging from ideas, music taste, content, political opinions, and much more than you think.\n\nThis project is aimed at improving the users' privacy by being independent from Google and bypassing their data collection.\n\nTherefore, the app is using the [Piped API](https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped), which uses proxies to circumvent Google's data collection and includes some other additional features.\n\nIf you have questions or need help, please make sure to read the [FAQ](https://libre-tube.github.io/#faq) before asking for help at the community channels. The [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#LibreTube:matrix.org) is considered as the main communication channel, all other forums or social media accounts are maintained by volunteers from the community but not the developer(s).\n\n<h2 align=\"left\">\n<sub>\n<img  src=\"assets/readme/phone.svg\"\n      height=\"30\"\n      width=\"30\">\n</sub>\nScreenshots\n</h2>\n\n<div style=\"width:100%; display:flex; justify-content:space-between;\">\n\n[<img src=\"fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_1.jpg\" width=19% alt=\"Home\">](fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_1.jpg)\n[<img src=\"fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_2.jpg\" width=19% alt=\"Home\">](fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_2.jpg)\n[<img src=\"fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_3.jpg\" width=19% alt=\"Subscriptions\">](fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_3.jpg)\n[<img src=\"fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_4.jpg\" width=19% alt=\"Library\">](fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_4.jpg)\n[<img src=\"fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_9.jpg\" width=19% alt=\"Channel Overview\">](fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/Screenshot_9.jpg)\n\n* More screenshots can be found [here](https://github.com/libre-tube/LibreTube/blob/master/SCREEN_SHOT.md)\n\n</div>\n\n<h2 align=\"left\">\n<sub>\n<img  src=\"assets/readme/feature.svg\"\n      height=\"30\"\n      width=\"30\">\n</sub>\nFeatures\n</h2>\n\n- [x] No Ads or Tracking\n- [x] Subscriptions\n- [x] Subscription Groups\n- [x] User Playlists\n- [x] Playlist Bookmarks\n- [x] Watch/Search History\n- [x] SponsorBlock\n- [x] ReturnYouTubeDislike\n- [x] DeArrow\n- [x] Downloads\n- [x] Background playback\n- [x] User Accounts via Piped (optional)\n\n<h2 align=\"left\">\n<sub>\n<img  src=\"assets/readme/community.svg\"\n      height=\"30\"\n      width=\"30\">\n</sub>\nContributing\n</h2>\n\nWhether you have ideas, translations, design changes, code cleaning or really heavy code changes, help is always welcome.

Piped acts as a middleman server between you and YouTube in this case, which prevents YouTube from accessing personal information such as your IP address. \nAdditionally, using Piped allows you to sync your subscriptions between LibreTube and Piped, which can be used on desktop too.\n\nWhile LibreTube only supports YouTube, NewPipe also allows the use of other platforms like SoundCloud, PeerTube, Bandcamp and media.ccc.de.<br>\nBoth are great clients for watching YouTube videos. It depends on the individual's use case which one fits their needs better.\n\n<h2 align=\"left\">\n<sub>\n<img  src=\"assets/readme/privacy.svg\"\n      height=\"30\"\n      width=\"30\">\n</sub>\nPrivacy Policy and Disclaimer\n</h2>\n\n\nLibreTube aims to protect the privacy of its users.

Those tests require parts of the framework to run.\n|   +-- org.openhab.binding.astro.tests\n|   +-- org.openhab.binding.avmfritz.tests\n|   +-- ...\n|\n+-- src/etc   Auxilary buildsystem files: The license header for automatic checks for example\n+-- tools     Static code analyser instructions\n|\n+-- CODEOWNERS  This file assigns people to directories so that they are informed if a pull-request\n                would modify their add-ons.\n```\n\n### Command line build\n\nTo build all add-ons from the command-line, type in:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install\n```\n\nMost of the time you do not need to build all bindings, but only the binding you are working on.\nTo simply build only your binding use the `-pl` option.\nFor example to build only the astro binding:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install -pl :org.openhab.binding.astro\n```\n\nIf you have a binding that has dependencies that are dynamically as specified in the feature.xml you can create a `.kar` instead of a `.jar` file.\nA `.kar` file will include the feature.xml and when added to openHAB will load and activate any dependencies specified in the feature.xml file.\nTo create a `.kar` file run Maven with the goal `karaf:kar`:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install karaf:kar -pl :org.openhab.binding.astro\n```\n\nTo improve build times you can add the following options to the command:\n\n| Option                        | Description                                         |\n| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| `-DskipChecks`                | Skip the static analysis (Checkstyle, FindBugs)     |\n| `-DskipTests`                 | Skip the execution of tests                         |\n| `-Dmaven.test.skip=true`      | Skip the compilation and execution of tests         |\n| `-Dfeatures.verify.skip=true` | Skip the Karaf feature verification                 |\n| `-Dspotless.check.skip=true`  | Skip the Spotless code style checks                 |\n| `-o`                          | Work offline so Maven does not download any updates |\n| `-T 1C`                       | Build in parallel, using 1 thread per core          |\n| `-pl :<add-on directory>`     | Build a single add-on                               |\n\nFor example you can skip checks and tests during development with:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install -DskipChecks -DskipTests -pl :org.openhab.binding.astro\n```\n\nAdding these options improves the build time but could hide problems in your code.\nParallel builds are also less easy to debug and the increased load may cause timing sensitive tests to fail.\n\n#### Translations\n\nAdd-on translations are managed via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/openhab-addons).\nThe English translation is taken from the openHAB-addons GitHub repo and automatically imported in Crowdin when changes are made to the English i18n properties file.\nWhen translations are added or updated and approved in Crowdin, a pull request is automatically created by Crowdin.\nTherefore translations should not be edited in the openHAB-addons repo, but only in Crowdin.\nOtherwise translation are overridden by the automatic process.\n\nTo fill the English properties file run the following Maven command on an add-on:\n\n```shell\nmvn i18n:generate-default-translations\n```\n\nThis command can also update the file when things or channel are added or updated.\n\nIn some cases the command does not work, and requires the full plug-in name.\nIn that case use:\n\n```shell\nmvn org.openhab.core.tools:i18n-maven-plugin:5.0.0:generate-default-translations\n```\n\n#### Code Quality\n\nTo check if your code is following the [code style](https://www.openhab.org/docs/developer/guidelines.html#b-code-formatting-rules-style) run:\n\n```shell\nmvn spotless:check\n```\n\nTo reformat your code so it conforms to the code style you can run:\n\n```shell\nmvn spotless:apply\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nWhen your add-on also has an integration test in the `itests` directory, you may need to update the runbundles in the `itest.bndrun` file when the Maven dependencies change.\nMaven can resolve the integration test dependencies automatically by executing:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean install -DwithResolver -DskipChecks\n```\n\nThe build generates a `.jar` file per bundle in the respective bundle `/target` directory.\n\n### How to develop via an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n\nWe have assembled some step-by-step guides for different IDEs on our developer documentation website:\n\n<https://www.openhab.org/docs/developer/#setup-the-development-environment>\n\nHappy coding!\n",

It\nis the alternative to Lenovo Vantage or Legion Zone (both Windows only).\n\nIt allows you to control features like the fan curve, power mode, power limits, rapid charging, and more. This has been achieved through reverse engineering and disassembling the ACPI firmware, as well as the firmware and memory of the embedded controller (EC).\n\n:star: **Please star this repository if this is useful or might be useful in the future.**\n\n:star2: **My goal is to merge the driver into the main Linux kernel so it comes automatically with Linux and no recompilation is required after a Linux update**\n\n:boom: **Starring shows that this is useful to me and the Linux community so hopefully a merge into the Kernel is possible.**\n\n## :rocket: Features\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img height=\"300\" style=\"float: center;\" src=\"doc/assets/fancurve_gui.jpg\" alt=\"fancurve\">\n    <img height=\"300\" style=\"float: center;\" src=\"doc/assets/psensor.png\" alt=\"psensor\">\n    <img height=\"300\" style=\"float: center;\" src=\"doc/assets/powermode.png\" alt=\"powermode\">\n</p>\n\n- [X] Light on RAM and CPU and without telemetry\n- [X] Fully controllable using scripts or from the command-line\n- [X] Simple GUI replacement for Lenovo Vantage: Fan curve, FN Lock, Win Key, Touchpad Power, Camera Power, Battery Conservation, Rapid Charging, Charge output from always on USB, Display Overdrive, Y-Logo LED Light, IO-Port LED Light, Hybrid Mode (GSync), CPU and GPU Overclock:\n    - Switch battery conservation mode; keep battery at 60% when on AC to prolong battery life (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=441057)\n    - Toggle Fn lock; Use special function on F1-F12 keys without pressing the Fn key\n    - Enable or disable touchpad\n- [X] Set a fully featured custom fan curve with up to 10 points:\n  - Set temperature points for when the fan speed (level) should change\n  - Use CPU, GPU and IC temperature to control the fan all at the same it\n  - Set the fan speed (RPM) at each level\n  - Even allows speed below 1600 RPM\n  - Set minimum temperature for each level that must be fallen below before slowing down the fans again\n  - Set acceleration and deceleration for each the fan when the fan speed should increase or decrease\n  - Save and load presets for different modes\n- [X] Lock and unlock the fan controller and fan speed\n- [X] Switch power mode (quiet, balanced, performance) using software\n  - Now you can do it using software in your system settings\n  - Changing with `Fn+Q` is also possible\n  - Depending on your desktop environment, you could automatically switch to quiet mode if you are on battery or performance mode when on AC power (e.g. KDE's Energy Saving settings)\n  - Switch between different fan profiles depending on the power profile (See: [Lenovo Legion Laptop Support Daemon](#lenovo-legion-laptop-support-daemonlegiond))\n- [X] Monitor fan speeds and temperatures (CPU, GPU, IC) using the now available sensors\n- [X] Enable or disable automatic switching to a \"Mini Fan Curve\" if temperatures are low for a long time\n\n## :mega: Overview\n\n- it comes with a driver (kernel module) that implements the Linux standard interfaces (sysfs, debugfs, hwmon)\n- using standard Linux interfaces makes it is compatible with the command line/file interface or standard GUI tools like psensor\n- compared to vendor tools for Windows, it even allows to set the fan curve. This allows to keep the fans\n  slowly and quietly running instead of constantly switching between fans off and loud fans. Perfect for quiet office work. :office:\n\n## :package: Available Packages\n\n- Debian/Ubuntu:\n  - Debian repo (for now): [here](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/lenovolegionlinux)\n- Fedora/RHEL Base Distros:\n    - Official Fedora COPR: [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mrduarte/LenovoLegionLinux/)\n- Arch Base Distros:\n    - [lenovolegionlinux-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lenovolegionlinux-git)\n    - [lenovolegionlinux-dkms-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lenovolegionlinux-dkms-git)\n- Gentoo Base Distros:\n    - [GURU Overlay](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/proj/guru.git)\n    - [ebuild](https://gpo.zugaina.org/sys-firmware/lenovolegionlinux)\n- [NixOS](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=lenovo-legion)\n\n[^1]: Build with latest commit every day at midnight GMT\n\n## :pushpin: Confirmed Compatible Models\n\n# If you have a 2022 or 2023 model, please help testing the new features [here](https://github.com/johnfanv2/LenovoLegionLinux/issues/46).\n\n# If you have a light in the lid (Y-logo) or at the IO-ports (all Legion 7), please help testing controlling it  [here](https://github.com/johnfanv2/LenovoLegionLinux/issues/54).\n\n**Other Lenovo Legion models from 2020 to 2023 probably also work.

Just reinstall kernel headers, e.g. in Debian:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install --reinstall linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n```\n\n### Build and Test Instruction\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/johnfanv2/LenovoLegionLinux.git\ncd LenovoLegionLinux/kernel_module\nmake\nsudo make reloadmodule\n```\n\n**For further instructions, problems, and tests see `Initial Usage Testing` below. Do them first before a permanent installation.**\n\nExpected result:\n\n- `make` finishes without displaying `Error`\n\nUnexpected result:\n\n- `make` aborts with an error\n- an error of kind `/lib/modules/XXXXXXXX/build: No such file or directory` like the following below. This means that the linux-headers are not installed properly for the current kernel. Please check your currrent kernel with `uname -r` and install linux-headers for it. Then there will be a directory `/lib/modules/XXXXXXXX/` where XXXXXX is the current kernel version, e.g. `5.19.0-28-generic` or `6.2.9-arch1-1`. If you have just updated your packages a restart might help or see https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=135931, https://forum.manjaro.org/t/missing-build-directory-in-5-15-16-1-manjaro-headers/101793.\n\n```text\nmake[1]: *** /lib/modules/6.2.9-arch1-1/build: No such file or directory.  Stop.\nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/home/user/LenovoLegionLinux/kernel_module'\nmake: *** [Makefile:13: all] Error 2\n```\n\n### Permanent Install Instruction\n\nAfter successfully building and testing (see below), run from the folder `LenovoLegionLinux/kernel_module`\n\n```bash\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\n**You must recompile and reinstall it again with above commands after each kernel update, as usual for external kernel modules.**\nI want to get it merged into the mainline Linux kernel, so this is not needed anymore. So please star this repository :)\n\n### Uninstall Instruction\n\nGo to the folder `LenovoLegionLinux/kernel_module`\n\n```bash\nmake\nsudo make uninstall\n```\n\n### Installing via DKMS\n\n> DKMS is a utility that eliminates the need to manually rebuild and reinstall the driver after every kernel update. DKMS will do the reinstallation automatically.\n\nYou must first install the package to with DKMS. See Requirements section.\n\n```\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/src/LenovoLegionLinux-1.0.0\nsudo cp ./kernel_module/* /usr/src/LenovoLegionLinux-1.0.0 -r\nsudo dkms add -m LenovoLegionLinux -v 1.0.0\nsudo dkms build -m LenovoLegionLinux -v 1.0.0\n```\n\nOr via makefile\n\n```\ncd kernel_module\nsudo make dkms # Don't forget to run as root\n```\n\n#### Secure boot\n\nIf you want the driver to work with secure boot, then follow the steps described here\nhttps://github.com/dell/dkms#secure-boot or here https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/User:Krin/Secure_Boot,_full_disk_encryption,_and_TPM2_unlocking_install#Secure_boot. Note that this is a little more advanced. For initial testing, just load the module as described in the steps above or disable secure boot.\n\n### Uninstalling via DKMS\n\n```\nsudo dkms remove -m LenovoLegionLinux -v 1.0.0\nreboot\n```\n\n### Permanently Patching the Kernel\n\nThis is only useful for advanced users that build there own kernel.\nA automatically generated patch is provided on the release page whenver a stable milestone has been reached: [Releases](https://github.com/johnfanv2/LenovoLegionLinux/releases)\n\n## :octocat: Initial Usage Testing\n\nPlease note:\n\n- Please test in the given order; try to fix a failed text before going to the next.\n- These tests are manual and in the terminal because this is an early version of this tool\n- You can copy-and-paste the commands. Paste with `Ctrl+Shift+V` inside the terminal.\n\n### Quick Test: Module is properly loaded\n\n```bash\n# After you have run from folder LenovoLegionLinux/kernel_module (for non DKMS)\nsudo make reloadmodule \n\n# Check the kernel log\nsudo dmesg\n```\n\nExpected result:\n\n- You should see a line like the following like `legion PNP0C09:00: legion_laptop loaded for this device`. `PNP0C09` might be replaced by other text.\n\nUnexpected result:\n\n- `insmod: ERROR: could not insert module legion-laptop.ko: Invalid module format` after running `make reloadmodule`\n- `legion PNP0C09:00: legion_laptop not loaded for this device`. The kernel module was not loaded properly. Redo first test.\n- `insmod: ERROR: could not insert module legion-laptop.ko: Key was rejected by service`: because you enable secure boot, you cannot load kernel modules.   Disable secure boot (in BIOS) or sign the kernel module with a private key.\n- if you see the following, the driver was not tested for your laptop model; please raise an issue with the maintainer if you think it should be compatible. If you want to try it anyhow with your model use `sudo make forcereloadmodule`\n\n```text\n[126675.495983] legion PNP0C09:00: Module not usable for this laptop because it is not in allowlist.

See `Creating and Setting your own Fan Curve` below.\n\n### Test: Finish\n\n- If you are satisfied with the test results, then you can install the kernel module permanently (see above).\n- Create a GitHub Issue and report if the test work or fail.\n  - Please include exact laptop model\n  - If errors occurred, include output of commands.\n- You also might to want to star this repository\n\n## :computer: Normal Usage\n\n**you have to install the kernel module permanently (see above), otherwise you must reload it manually after each restart**\n\n### Temperature and Fan Monitoring\n\nThe temperatures and fan speeds should be displayed in any graphical tool that monitors them, e.g. psensor. You have to install it first before running:\n\n```bash\npsensor\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img height=\"450\" style=\"float: center;\" src=\"doc/assets/psensor.png\" alt=\"psensor\">\n</p>\n\n### Changing and Setting your own Fan Curve with the Python GUI\n\nStart the GUI as root\n\n```bash\n# run from folder LenovoLegionLinux\nsudo python/legion_linux/legion_linux/legion_gui.py\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img height=\"450\" style=\"float: center;\" src=\"doc/assets/fancurve_gui.jpg\" alt=\"fancurve\">\n</p>\n\n- with `Read from HW` you can read the current fan curve that is saved in the hardware and display it.\n- you can edit the values of the fancurve. They will not applied to hardware until your press `Apply to HW`\n- press `Apply to HW` to write the currently displayed fancurve to hardware and activate it\n- you can load and save a fancurve to a preset. Select the preset with the drop-down menu and press `Load from Preset` or `Save to preset`.\n- loading a preset will just display it. You still have to press `Apply to HW` to activate it\n- presets are stored in a yaml file in `/root/.config/legion_linux/`. You can edit them also manually.\n- the number of points is fixed depending on power mode. Deactivated points are currently displayed as `0`s.\n- lock fan controller: enabling this will freeze the current fan speed and the temperatures used to control the fan controller\n\nUnexpected:\n\n- an error is displayed or everything is `0`: kernel module not loaded or installed (see above) or not compatible (do manual tests from above)\n- an value is not accepted when `Write to HW`: the value is out-of-range and was not accepted by hardware\n\n### Changing and Setting your own Fan Curve with the Python CLI\n\nYou can do the same as the GUI from a CLI program. It will access the same presets.\n\n```bash\n# run from folder LenovoLegionLinux\nsudo python/legion_linux/legion_linux/legion_cli.py\n```\n\n```text\nusage: legion_cli.py [-h] {fancurve-write-preset-to-hw,fancurve-write-hw-to-preset,fancurve-write-file-to-hw,fancurve-write-hw-to-file} ...\n\nLegion CLI\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n\nsubcommands:\n  {fancurve-write-preset-to-hw,fancurve-write-hw-to-preset,fancurve-write-file-to-hw,fancurve-write-hw-to-file}\n    fancurve-write-preset-to-hw\n                        Write fan curve from preset to hardware\n    fancurve-write-hw-to-preset\n                        Write fan curve from hardware to preset\n    fancurve-write-file-to-hw\n                        Write fan curve from file to hardware\n    fancurve-write-hw-to-file\n                        Write fan curve from hardware to file\n```\n\n### Creating and Setting your own Fan Curve with Script\n\nJust run the script to set the fan curve. It is in the folder `LenovoLegionLinux`.\n\n```bash\n# Go to folder LenovoLegionLinux and run it. It should output \"Writing fancurve successful!\" if it finishes successful\nsudo ./setmyfancurve.sh\n# And check new fan curve\nsudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/legion/fancurve\n```\n\nOpen the file `setmyfancurve.sh` and edit it to adapt the values in the script to create your own fan curve. Follow the description in the file.\n\nUnexpected output:\n\n- `bash: ./setmyfancurve.sh: Permission denied`: You have to make the script executable with `chmod +x ./setmyfancurve` first\n- script does not end with \"fancurve set\": maybe path to hwmon changed; Please report this\n\nNote:\n\n- **If you want to reset your fan curve, just toggle with Ctrl+Q or Fn+Q the power mode or restart and everything is gone.**\n- Currently, there is no GUI available.\n- Currently, the hardware resets the fan curve randomly or if you change power mode, suspend, or restart. Just run the script again.\n- You might want to create different scripts for different usages. Just copy it and adapt the values.\n\n### Change power mode from software\n\nFor this to work, you must install the kernel module permanently (see above). Alternatively, you can restart the the power daemon (`systemctl restart power-profiles-daemon.service` in Ubuntu) after reloading the kernel module (see above).\n\n#### Modify/Control with GUI\n\nWith the GUI, the current power mode can be changed by selecting the mode in the box labeled with `Power mode/platform profile`.\n\n#### Modify/Control with Widget\n\nIn Ubuntu/Gnome go to `Settings->Power->Power Mode/Power Saving Option` or the applet in the top right.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img height=\"450\" style=\"float: center;\" src=\"doc/assets/powermode.png\" alt=\"psensor\">\n</p>\nAutomatic change of power mode can be changed in the settings of the distribution ( in Ubuntu).\n\n#### Modify with CLI\n\n```bash\n# List all profiles (power-saver = quiet= blue)\npowerprofilesctl list\n\n#   performance:\n#     Driver:     platform_profile\n#     Degraded:   no\n\n#   balanced:\n#     Driver:     platform_profile\n\n# * power-saver:\n#     Driver:     platform_profile\n\n# Set a profile, e.g. power-saver=quiet\npowerprofilesctl set power-saver\n# or balanced\npowerprofilesctl set balanced\n# or performance\npowerprofilesctl set performance\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also directly access it on a lower level:\n\n```bash\n# Access current profile\ncat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile\n\n# Change current profile (AS ROOT): available modes quiet, balanced, performance, balanced-performance\n# quiet = power-saver\necho quiet > /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile\n# or balanced\necho balanced > /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile\n# or performance\necho performance > /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile\n# or custom-mode = balanced-performance (not available on all models); the LED should turn pink/purple\necho balanced-performance > /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile\n```\n\n#### Custom Power Mode\n\nIf you model support the custom power mode, then you can:\n\n- enter custom power mode\n- LED should turn pink/purple\n- customnize CPU/GPU boost and TGP settings\n\nYou can change to it with in the GUI: Open the GUI and select \"Custom Mode\" for power profile. Alternativley, you can change to it with in the command line with:\n\n```bash\necho balanced-performance > /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile\n```\n\nUnfortunately, the `power-profile-deamon` or `powerprofilesctl` currently do not support this mode.\n\n### Enable or disable the mini fan curve\n\nIf the laptop stays cool for a longer time, it will enable the \"mini fan curve\", a special fan curve with only a few points. It will usually spin the fans. You can enable or disable that. If you want to use your configured fan curve in any case, disable it. The mini fan curve is not available on all models (you will see error for mini fan curve when running `cat /sys/kernel/debug/legion/fancurve`).\n\nWith the GUI, the mini fan curve is enabled/disabled by checking/unchecking the box `Minifancurve if cold` and pressing `Apply to HW`.\n\n### Lenovo Legion Laptop Support Daemon(legiond)\n\nThe LLL Daemon is supported in Systemd and OpenRC(Experimental).\nIf you install LLL manually(not throngh the package manager), you may need to run the [systemd_install.sh](extra/systemd_install.sh) unside the extra folder.\n\nThis Daemon allow to chnage automatically bettwen fan profiles set in the gui depending of the power mode and if the laptop is or not plug in:\nThese are the profiles avaiable:\n\n- quiet-battery - Fan Profile on quiet mode on battery\n- balance-battery - Fan Profile on balance mode on battery\n- balanced-performance-battery - Fan Profile on custom mode on battery\n- quiet-ac - Fan Profile on quiet mode on charger\n- balance-ac - Fan Profile on balance mode on charger\n- balanced-performance-ac - Fan Profile on custom mode on charger\n- performance-ac - Fan Profile on performance mode on charger\n\nExample profiles are [here](extra/service/profiles) can also be set via the gui for easy set up:\n1 - Set the `Fan Curve` you like to use\n2 - Chose on the profile above in `Fancurve Preset` and hit Sate to Preset (will ask for you password)\n3 - Set all the profiles\n4 - Go to the `Automation` tab and enable the option `Lenovo Legion Laptop Support Daemon Enable`\n\nThis systemd service also have extras features that can be activated by editing [legiond.ini](extra/service/legiond.ini) located /etc/legion_linux/legiond.ini:\n\n- cpu_control - activate use of RyzenADJ on AMD or undervolt on Intel to make custom cpu setting for each power mode\n  - bat_bp - Custom Cpu setting for custom mode on battery\n  - ac_bp - Custom Cpu setting for custom mode on charger\n  - bat_q - Custom Cpu setting for quiet mode on battery\n  - ac_q - Custom Cpu setting for quiet mode on charger\n  - bat_b - Custom Cpu setting for balance mode on battery\n  - ac_b - Custom Cpu setting for balance mode on charger\n  - ac_p - Custom Cpu setting for performance mode on charger\n- gpu_control:\n  - nvidia - use ```nvidia-smi -pl``` command to change the TDP of the GPU (only work on driver 525 and lower)\n  - radeon - use ```rocm-smi --setpoweroverdrive``` command to change the TDP of the GPU\n\n    - tdp_bat_bp - Custom GPU TDP for custom mode on battery\n    - tdp_ac_bp - Custom GPU TDP for custom mode on charger\n    - tdp_bat_q - Custom GPU TDP for quiet mode on battery\n    - tdp_ac_q - Custom GPU TDP for quiet mode on charger\n    - tdp_bat_b - Custom GPU TDP for balance mode on battery\n    - tdp_ac_b - Custom GPU TDP for balance mode on charger\n    - tdp_ac_p - Custom GPU TDP for performance mode on charger\n  - Note: The default values in the .env file are from RTX 3070\n\nNOTE: `legiond.service` depends on `acpid.service` and if you enable `legiond.service`, `acpid.service` should be started automatically.\nIf your CPU tweaks often get reset to default, enable `legiond-cpuset.timer` to override it.\n\nSee [README.org](extra/service/legiond/README.org)\n\n### Lock and Unlock the Fan Controller and Fan Speed\n\nYou can lock the current fan speed. If it is locked, the fan speed will stays constant and does not react to temperature changes. You might want to lock the fan at a high speed during a game. I would not recommend keeping it locked all the time. If your fan controller gets locked accidentally, e.g. by Windows tools, you can unlock it. A locked fan controller might be the reason for a non-working fan control. If the fan controller is locked, the additional temperature sensors are not updated anymore and also stay constant.\n\nWith the GUI, the fan controller is locked by checking the box `Lock fan controller` and pressing `Apply to HW`.\n\n### Set Speed to Maximum Fan Speed\n\nThe fan can be set to maximum fan speed regardless of temperature. This is sometimes called extreme cooling mode or dust cleaning mode. Do not enable this for long periods of time, because it might degrade your fans faster.\n\nWith the GUI, the current fan speed is set to the maximum possible value by checking `Set speed to maximum fan speed` and pressing `Apply to HW`.\n\nThis is currently not available in many models.\n\n### Set Battery Conservation Mode to Prolong Battery Life when AC is plugged in\n\nYou can enable battery conservation mode. When conservation mode is enabled, the constant charging of the battery is disabled when the AC (charger) is plugged in. It will try to keep your battery state of charge at around 50%. This is said to prolong the battery life.\n\nWith the GUI, the battery conservation is enabled by checking the box `Battery conservation` (changes should apply immediately).\n\n### Toggle Fn lock to use special functions on F1-F12 keys without pressing Fn key\n\nYou can lock the Fn keys. You can do it by pressing Fn+Esc. This should also toggle the light in the Esc key (if available in your model).\nIf enabled, the special functions, e.g. increase sound volume on F3, is triggered without pressing Fn.\n\nWith the GUI, the Fn-lock is enabled/disabled by checking/unchecking the box `Fn Lock` (changes should apply immediately).\n\n### Enable/Disable Touch Pad\n\nYou can enable or disable the touch pad. You can do it by pressing Fn+F10 (or similar).\n\nWith the GUI, the touch pad is enabled/disabled by checking/unchecking the box `Touch Pad Enabled` (changes should apply immediately).\n\n### Keyboard Backlight\n\n- 4 Zone RGB backlight: please use https://github.com/4JX/L5P-Keyboard-RGB\n- off/on white backlight or off/medium/bright white backlight: supported by this software but can be controlled by all programs for LED control in linux\n\n## Known Bugs\n\nSome bugs cannot be fixed due to the firmware in the hardware:\n\n- size of fan curve cannot be changed (size is 10 on performance mode, 9 otherwise) but you can practically disable points by setting the temperature limits to 127, as already done when writing to `auto_points_size`\n\n## :clap: Credits\n\n### Basis of this work\n\nThank you for your work on Windows tools that were the basis of the Linux support:\n\n* [SmokelessCPU](https://github.com/SmokelessCPUv2), for reverse engineering the embedded controller firmware\n  and finding the direct IO control method to communicate with the embedded controller\n* [FanFella](https://github.com/SmokelessCPUv2), for finding the address to lock or unlock the fan controller\n* [Bartosz Cichecki](https://github.com/BartoszCichecki), for creating [LenovoLegionToolkit](https://github.com/BartoszCichecki/LenovoLegionToolkit), a Windows tool for newer Legion models that controls the Laptop with ACPI/WMI methods.

Only they are relevant for the fan controller.\nThey are provided by the new kernel module and otherwise not accessible because they are read from the embedded controller.\n\n### What are the new fan speed sensors?\n\nThey report the fan speed in revolutions per minute (rpm). They are provided by the new kernel module and otherwise not accessible because they are read from the embedded controller.\n\n### What temperatures are used for controlling the fan speed?\n\nThe CPU, GPU, and \"IC\" temperature is used. These are (usually) additional sensors that are different from the temperature sensors that are reported when you do not use the kernel model. In particular, the \"IC\" temperature limit might be set to a low value which results in almost-always running fans.\n\n### My CPU and GPU temperatures are low but the fan is still running?\n\nSee above. In particular, the  \"IC\" temperature sensor.\n\n### Is the fan speed controlled by power consumption?\n\nI have no reason to believe that. As far as I know and observed, only the temperatures are used.\n\n### My fans do not spin up, never stop, or never change speed (after using other tools)?\n\nIf they always have roughly constant speed, maybe you have locked the fan controller, often called locking fan speed.\nYou can unlock/lock the fan speed controller in the GUI (see above). I would recommend not locking them. Doing\na BIOS/UEFI update usually also unlocks it. But beware and consider making a BIOS (re)-update.\n\nIf the fans never spin up fast even under hight load, the fan controller might be locked (above). Additionally,\nalso check that the reported temperatures for CPU (or GPU) really increase under load. Only, the temperatures\n\"CPU Temperature\", \"GPU Temperature\", and \"IC Temperature\" are used for fan control. These, are used internally\nby the fan controller in hardware.\n\nIf otherwise the fans never stop, you might have set a very low upper temperature limit for CPU, GPU or IC. Many\nmodels also come with a low temperature limit even on quiet mode, so fans never really turn off. You can just increase the temperature\nlimits for the lowest level.\n\n### The fans are loud when idle.\n\nSee above.\n\n### The fans turn on when doing light work like browsing.\n\nEven when browsing there might be small bursts of work for the CPU. So it gets hot for a short time and the fans turn on. You can:\n\n- Change the fan curve, in particular increase temperature limit and increase acceleration time\n- Disable CPU boost mode\n- Also see above\n\n### The reported temperatures do not change or seem wrong.\n\nSee above.\n\n### Even under high load, the fans are not going fast enough.\n\nSee above.\n\n### After a BIOS update something, e.g. the fan controls, does not work anymore?\n\nMaybe there was a problem during the BIOS update. Downgrade to an older version again. Then test it with the old version. Then do the BIOS upgrade again and check with the version.\n\n### How to do a BIOS upgrade or reset the embedded controller to fix a problem?\n\nThe easiest way is to downgrade to a older version and then upgrade to the current version again. Also test it with the old version.\nYou can also just try reset the embedded controller by:\n\n- Shutdown laptop, unplug everything (charger, USB, ...)\n- Press AND hold power button for 60 seconds; keep holding even if it turns on\n- After 60 seconds, release power button\n- Press power button shortly to turn laptop on\n\n### What does quiet, balanced, or performance mode do?\n\nYou can switch the mode by pressing Fn+Q and it will change the mode in the firmware and the color of the LED, even without any driver support (= without this kernel module).\n\nChanging power mode without Lenovo Legion Linux is purely implemented in hardware:\n\n- The color of LED changes.\n- Fan curve in embedded controller changes.\n- Other purely hardware configs might also change, but I have not observed one.\n- ~~As far as I know, power saving or performance of CPU does not change, as this is controlled by kernel or tools like cpupower~~\n- An analysis of the ACPI firmware, which is \"stored in hardware\", shows that some power options, e.g. the STAPM limit, of the CPU and GPU are changed via ACPI calls. This can be observed by changing power mode with Fn+Q and checking CPU power limits, e.g. with `ryzenadj` for AMD CPUs. ~~However, no changes to the GPU power limits are observed on NVIDIA GPUs, which might indicate that the integration of ACPI and GPU driver is faulty on Linux~~ On driver 535+, GPU power limits for nvidia changes on battery power (40w on quiet and 50w on balanced for RTX 3070), on power adapter, the power limit are allways set to max on peformance (reported by `nvidia-smi`), but more power is allowed to the GPU on performance or custom mode in demanding GPU tasks. If the GPU power limit on performance mode is stuck on 80W compared to 115W/130W on Windows, you're affected by this bug: [NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules#483](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/483).\n- Without Lenovo Legion Linux, the kernel or other system tools will not know that you have changed the power mode.\n\nChanging power mode **with** Lenovo Legion Linux:\n\n- It changes all of the above.\n- Additionally the driver in Lenovo Legion Linux makes this information available to the kernel and other services like the Power Profiles daemon; Those can, if configured, change the performance of the CPU or GPU.\n\nOn Windows it is similar: Changing the power mode is reported to the system or tools like Vantage which change the power plan.\n\n### Should I use balanced mode or performance for gaming?\n\nThe difference in usable performance (FPS) is minimal. Use performance mode to get the utmost highest performance, otherwise use the balanced mode.\n\n### One fan runs at full speed all the time. What should I do?\n\nFirst check that the fan curve is set properly and this is **not** a misconfiguration. Then check if the temperatures used for fan control (see: [\"new temperatures\"](#what-are-the-new-fan-speed-sensors)) have low values on idle. If just one fan is on full speed but the other one is controlled according to fan curve, then you should [reset the BIOS and EC controller](#how-to-do-a-bios-upgrade-or-reset-the-embedded-controller-to-fix-a-problem).\n\n### What is \"advanced thermal optimization\" in the BIOS?\n\nYou can change the fan curve and minimal fan speed that are programmed into the hardware:\n\n- `off`: Turn off the fan if cold enough\n- `level 1`: Minimal fan speed level 1\n- `level 2`: Minimal fan speed level 2\n- `level 3`: Minimal fan speed level 3\n\nAlso see: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Gaming-Laptops/Legion-7-Bios-What-is-advanced-thermal-optimization/m-p/5079357\n\n### I don't use GNOME. How do I get a nice widget for changing the power mode?\n\nThe power mode can be changed using Fn+Q.\n\nIf you use KDE, the power mode can be changed from the \"Battery And Brightness\" icon.\n\nIf you don't need a GUI, you could [use the commandline](#modify-with-cli).\n\nFor other desktop environments:\nThis driver makes power mode changing available to tools like `power-profiles-daemon`.\n\nFirst you should try changing from the terminal, see [\"Powermode -> Modify with CLI\"](#modify-with-cli). If it works, then install `power-profiles-daemon`.\n\nA graphical GNOME applet uses `power-profiles-daemon` to change the power mode using software. It is not provided by this tool, but is a standard tool already integrated into GNOME.\n\nFor KDE, there is the graphical tool `powerdevil`, which also uses `power-profiles-daemon` internally.\n\n### It almost works, but (some) temperature sensor/changing point in fan control or (some) fan speed is not working. What should I do?\n\nFirst, try to [reset the embedded controller](#how-to-do-a-bios-upgrade-or-reset-the-embedded-controller-to-fix-a-problem) OR do a BIOS update/downgrade to reset everything.\n\n### It does not work after a kernel update.\n\nOption 1: Recompile/reinstall the module, see: [Permanent Install Instructions](#permanent-install-instruction).\nOption 2: Use DKMS to automate this process for every kernel update, see: [Installing via DKMS](#installing-via-dkms)\n\n### My screen is dimmed after a time of inactivity even if I disabled that in Ubuntu. How to fix that? (GNOME)\n\n```bash\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-brightness 100\n```\n\nSee: https://old.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/utle2w/ubuntu_2204_is_there_a_way_to_disable_screen/\n\n### How to power down the dGPU while not in use and use the iGPU for power saving instead?\n\nThis describes _a way_ to configure and use it on Ubuntu using X11. It configures it such that\neverything runs on iGPU if not otherwise selected.\n- Check that Hybrid Mode is enabled in the BIOS.\n- Check that X11 is used and not Wayland:\n```bash\n# It should output something like: \"x11\"\necho $XDG_SESSION_TYPE\n```\n- Install `prime` and select \"on-demand\". A restart might be needed:\n```bash\nsudo prime-select on-demand\n```\n- Check with `nvidia-smi` that no programs run on the dGPU:\n```bash\nsudo nvidia-smi\n```\n  Note that the one process `0   N/A  N/A  ***  G   /usr/lib/xorg/Xorg   4MiB` is ok. Moreover, note\n  that running `nvidia-smi` powers up the GPU for some time.\n- Allow `d3cold` mode:\n```bash\n# Note: Only one of the commands would work; depending on the path to the device which is your GPU\necho 1 > /sys/devices/pci0000\\:00/0000\\:00\\:01.1/d3cold_allowed \necho 1 > /sys/devices/pci0000\\:00/0000\\:00\\:01.0/d3cold_allowed \n```\nCheck that GPU Runtime `D3` status is enabled:\n```bash\nsudo cat /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0000:01:00.0/power\n```\n- Check the current state of the GPU:\n```bash\n# Note: Only one of the commands would work; depending on the path to the device which is your GPU\n# It should output \"D3cold\":\ncat /sys/devices/pci0000\\:00/0000\\:00\\:01.0/power_state\ncat /sys/devices/pci0000\\:00/0000\\:00\\:01.1/power_state \n```\n- Run `nvidia-smi`, which powers the GPU up for some time. Check the `power_state` again. It should go to `D0` and then go to `D3cold` after some time. Compared to `nvidia-smi`, running `cat /sys/devices/pci0000\\:00/0000\\:00\\:01.1/power_state ` does not seem to wake up the GPU.\n\n\n```bash\nsudo cat /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0000:01:00.0/power\n```\n\n\n\n## :question: Unanswered Questions\n\n- What exactly is the third temperature? Currently, it is currently called IC Temperature.\n- Is \"quiet mode\" suitable for gaming?\n\n## :information_desk_person: Overview for Developers\n\nThe software consists of two parts:\n\n- Kernel module in the `kernel_module` folder:\n  - Accesses the embedded controller by writing to its memory\n  - Creates new \"files\": `/sys/kernel/debug/legion/fancurve`, `/sys/module/legion_laptop/drivers/platform\\:legion/PNP0C09\\:00/powermode` ,\n    `/sys/class/hwmon/X/temp1_input`, `/sys/class/hwmon/X/pwmY_auto_pointZ_pwm`, ... that allows to\n    read the temperatue sensors, control the fan curve, change power mode etc.\n- Python packages in the `python` folder:\n  - `legion.py`: A Python module to modify the fan curve and other settings from Python; Encapsulate reading and writing to the \"files\" provided by the above kernel module and other modules like `ideapad_laptop`; All changes from `legion_gui.py` and `legion_cli.py` goes through this Python module.\n  - `legion_gui.py`: a GUI program that uses `legion.py` to change setttings.\n  - `legion_cli.py`: a CLI program that uses `legion.py` to change setttings.\n\n## Legal Matters\n\nReference to any Lenovo products, services, processes, or other information and/or use of Lenovo Trademarks does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation thereof by Lenovo.\n\nThe use of Lenovo®, Lenovo Legion™, Yoga®, IdeaPad® or other trademarks within this website and associated tools and libraries is only to provide a recognisable identifier to users to enable them to associate that these tools will work with Lenovo laptops.\n",

See: [default-config.toml](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#default-config)\n- CLI first (manpages and shell completion included)\n- Doesn't require disabling SIP (System Integrity Protection)\n- [Proper multi-monitor support](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#multiple-monitors) (i3-like paradigm)\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to get autoupdates (Preferred)\n\n```\nbrew install --cask nikitabobko/tap/aerospace\n```\n\nIn multi-monitor setup please make sure that monitors [are properly arranged](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#proper-monitor-arrangement).\n\nOther installation options: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#installation\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> By using AeroSpace, you acknowledge that it's not [notarized](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution).\n>\n> Notarization is a \"security\" feature by Apple.\n> You send binaries to Apple, and they either approve them or not.\n> In reality, notarization is about building binaries the way Apple likes it.\n>\n> I don't have anything against notarization as a concept.\n> I specifically don't like the way Apple does notarization.\n> I don't have time to deal with Apple.\n>\n> [Homebrew installation script](https://github.com/nikitabobko/homebrew-tap/blob/main/Casks/aerospace.rb) is configured to\n> automatically delete `com.apple.quarantine` attribute, that's why the app should work out of the box, without any warnings that\n> \"Apple cannot check AeroSpace for malicious software\"\n\n## Community, discussions, issues\n\nAeroSpace project doesn't accept Issues directly - we ask you to create a [Discussion](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions) first.\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.\n\nCommunity discussions happen at GitHub Discussions.\nThere you can discuss bugs, propose new features, ask your questions, show off your setup, or just chat.\n\nThere are 7 channels:\n-   [#all](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions).\n    [RSS](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions.atom?discussions_q=sort%3Adate_created).\n    Feed with all discussions.\n-   [#announcements](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/announcements).\n    [RSS](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/announcements.atom?discussions_q=category%3Aannouncements+sort%3Adate_created).\n    Only maintainers can post here.\n    Highly moderated traffic.\n-   [#announcements-releases](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/announcements-releases).\n    [RSS](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/announcements-releases.atom?discussions_q=category%3Aannouncements-releases+sort%3Adate_created).\n    Announcements about non-patch releases.\n    Only maintainers can post here.\n-   [#feature-ideas](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/feature-ideas).\n    [RSS](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/feature-ideas.atom?discussions_q=category%3Afeature-ideas+sort%3Adate_created).\n-   [#general](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/general).\n    [RSS](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/general.atom?discussions_q=sort%3Adate_created+category%3Ageneral).\n-   [#potential-bugs](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/potential-bugs).\n    [RSS](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/potential-bugs.atom?discussions_q=category%3Apotential-bugs+sort%3Adate_created).\n    If you think that you have encountered a bug, you can discuss your bugs here.\n-   [#questions-and-answers](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/questions-and-answers).\n    [RSS](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/discussions/categories/questions-and-answers.atom?discussions_q=category%3Aquestions-and-answers+sort%3Adate_created).\n    Everyone is welcome to ask questions.\n    Everyone is encouraged to answer other people's questions.\n\n## Project status\n\nPublic Beta. AeroSpace can be used as a daily driver, but expect breaking changes until 1.0 is reached.\n\nWhat stops us from 1.0 release:\n- [x] https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/131 Performance. Implement thread-per-application to circumvent macOS blocking AX API.\n- [ ] https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/1215 _Big refactoring_. Rewrite mutable double-linked core tree data structure to immutable single-linked persistent tree.\n  Important for: stability and potential performance\n  - [ ] https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/1216 The big refactoring will help us to fix stability issue that windows may randomly jump to the focused workspace\n  - [ ] https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/68 The big refactoring will help us to support macOS native tabs\n- [ ] https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/278 Implement shell-like combinators.\n  Ignore a lot of crazy fuss in the issue,\n  We are most probably going with the minimal approach to only introduce common shell-combinators: `||`, `&&`, `;` and `eval` command to send multiple commands in one go.\n- [ ] https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/1012 Investigate a possibility to use `CGEvent.tapCreate` API for global hotkeys\n  - [ ] https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/28 Maybe it will allow to distinguish left and right modifiers. Maybe not\n\nBig and important issues which will go after 1.0 release:\n- [ ] https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/2 sticky windows\n- [ ] https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/260 Dynamic TWM\n\n## Development\n\nA notes on how to setup the project, build it, how to run the tests, etc. can be found here: [dev-docs/development.md](./dev-docs/development.md)\n\n## Project values\n\n**Values**\n- AeroSpace is targeted at advanced users and developers\n- Keyboard centric\n- Breaking changes (configuration files, CLI, behavior) are avoided as much as possible, but it must not let the software stagnate.\n  Thus breaking changes can happen, but with careful considerations and helpful message.\n  [Semver](https://semver.org/) major version is bumped in case of a breaking change (It's all guaranteed once AeroSpace reaches 1.0 version, until then breaking changes just happen)\n- AeroSpace doesn't use GUI, unless necessarily\n  - AeroSpace will never provide a GUI for configuration.\n    For advanced users, it's easier to edit a configuration file in text editor rather than navigating through checkboxes in GUI.\n  - Status menu icon is ok, because visual feedback is needed\n- Provide _practical_ features. Fancy appearance features are not _practical_ (e.g. window borders, transparency, animations, etc.)\n- \"dark magic\" (aka \"private APIs\", \"code injections\", etc.) must be avoided as much as possible\n  - Right now, AeroSpace uses only a single private API to get window ID of accessibility object `_AXUIElementGetWindow`.\n    Everything else is [macOS public accessibility API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applicationservices/axuielement_h).\n  - AeroSpace will never require you to disable SIP (System Integrity Protection).\n  - The goal is to make AeroSpace easily maintainable, and resistant to macOS updates.\n\n**Non Values**\n- Play nicely with existing macOS features.\n  If limitations are imposed then AeroSpace won't play nicely with existing macOS features\n  (For example, AeroSpace doesn't acknowledge the existence of macOS Spaces, and it uses [emulation of its own workspaces](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#emulation-of-virtual-workspaces))\n- Ricing.\n  AeroSpace provides only a very minimal support for ricing - gaps and a few callbacks for integrations with bars.\n  The current maintainer doesn't care about ricing.\n  Ricing issues are not a priority, and they are mostly ignored.\n  The ricing stance can change only with the appearance of more maintainers.\n\n## macOS compatibility table\n\n|                                                                                | macOS 13 (Ventura) | macOS 14 (Sonoma) | macOS 15 (Sequoia) | macOS 26 (Tahoe) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |\n| AeroSpace binary runs on ...                                                   | +                  | +                 | +                  | +                |\n| AeroSpace debug build from sources is supported on ...                         |                    | +                 | +                  | +                |\n| AeroSpace release build from sources is supported on ...

Contributions are very welcome.\n\nLocal development and guidelines are available in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Default keybindings\n\nOn the first launch of GlazeWM, a default configuration can optionally be generated.\n\nBelow is a cheat sheet of all available commands and their default keybindings.\n\n![Infographic](/resources/assets/cheatsheet.png)\n\n## Config documentation\n\nThe [default config](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm/blob/main/resources/assets/sample-config.yaml) file is generated at `%userprofile%\\.glzr\\glazewm\\config.yaml`.\n\nTo use a different config file location, you can launch the GlazeWM executable with the CLI argument `--config=\"...\"`, like so:\n\n```sh\n./glazewm.exe start --config=\"C:\\<PATH_TO_CONFIG>\\config.yaml\"\n```\n\nOr pass a value for the `GLAZEWM_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable:\n\n```sh\nsetx GLAZEWM_CONFIG_PATH \"C:\\<PATH_TO_CONFIG>\\config.yaml\"\n```\n\nWith the benefit of using a custom path being that you can choose a different name for the config file, such as `glazewm.yaml`.\n\n### Config: General\n\n```yaml\ngeneral:\n  # Commands to run when the WM has started (e.g. to run a script or launch\n  # another application).\n  startup_commands: []\n\n  # Commands to run just before the WM is shutdown.\n  shutdown_commands: []\n\n  # Commands to run after the WM config has reloaded.\n  config_reload_commands: []\n\n  # Whether to automatically focus windows underneath the cursor.\n  focus_follows_cursor: false\n\n  # Whether to switch back and forth between the previously focused\n  # workspace when focusing the current workspace.\n  toggle_workspace_on_refocus: false\n\n  cursor_jump:\n    # Whether to automatically move the cursor on the specified trigger.\n    enabled: true\n\n    # Trigger for cursor jump:\n    # - 'monitor_focus': Jump when focus changes between monitors.\n    # - 'window_focus': Jump when focus changes between windows.\n    trigger: \"monitor_focus\"\n```\n\n### Config: Keybindings\n\nThe available keyboard shortcuts can be customized via the `keybindings` option. A keybinding consists of one or more key combinations and one or more commands to run when pressed.\n\nIt's recommended to use the alt key for keybindings. The Windows key is unfortunately a pain to remap, since the OS reserves certain keybindings (e.g. `lwin+l`).\n\n```yaml\nkeybindings:\n  # Command(s) to run.\n  - commands: [\"focus --workspace 1\"]\n\n    # Key combination(s) to trigger the keybinding.\n    bindings: [\"alt+1\"]\n\n  # Multiple commands can be run in a sequence (e.g. to move a window to a\n  # workspace + focus workspace).\n  - commands: [\"move --workspace 1\", \"focus --workspace 1\"]\n    bindings: [\"alt+shift+1\"]\n```\n\n**Full list of keys that can be used for

international keyboards treat the right-side alt key differently. For these keyboard layouts, use `ralt+ctrl` instead of `ralt` to bind the right-side alt key.\n\n### Config: Gaps\n\nThe gaps between windows can be changed via the `gaps` property in the config file. Inner and outer gaps are set separately.\n\n```yaml\ngaps:\n  # Gap between adjacent windows.\n  inner_gap: \"20px\"\n\n  # Gap between windows and the screen edge.\n  outer_gap:\n    top: \"20px\"\n    right: \"20px\"\n    bottom: \"20px\"\n    left: \"20px\"\n```\n\n### Config: Workspaces\n\nWorkspaces need to be predefined via the `workspaces` property in the config file. A workspace is automatically assigned to each monitor on startup.\n\n```yaml\nworkspaces:\n  # This is the unique ID for the workspace. It's used in keybinding\n  # commands, and is also the label shown in 3rd-party apps (e.g. Zebar) if\n  # `display_name` is not provided.\n  - name: \"1\"\n\n    # Optional override for the workspace label used in 3rd-party apps.\n    # Does not need to be unique.\n    display_name: \"Work\"\n\n    # Optionally force the workspace on a specific monitor if it exists.\n    # 0 is your leftmost screen, 1 is the next one to the right, and so on.\n    bind_to_monitor: 0\n\n    # Optionally prevent workspace from being deactivated when empty.\n    keep_alive: false\n```\n\n### Config: Window rules\n\nCommands can be run when a window is first launched. This is useful for adding window-specific behaviors like always starting a window as fullscreen or assigning to a specific workspace.\n\nWindows can be targeted by their process, class, and title. Multiple matching criteria can be used together to target a window more precisely.\n\n```yaml\nwindow_rules:\n  - commands: [\"move --workspace 1\"]\n    match:\n      # Move browsers to workspace 1.\n      - window_process: { regex: \"msedge|brave|chrome\" }\n\n  - commands: [\"ignore\"]\n    match:\n      # Ignores any Zebar windows.\n      - window_process: { equals: \"zebar\" }\n\n      # Ignores picture-in-picture windows for browsers.\n      # Note that *both* the title and class must match for the rule to run.\n      - window_title: { regex: \"[Pp]icture.in.[Pp]icture\" }\n        window_class: { regex: \"Chrome_WidgetWin_1|MozillaDialogClass\" }\n```\n\n### Config: Window effects\n\nVisual effects can be applied to windows via the `window_effects` option. Currently, colored borders are the only effect available with more to come in the future.\n\n> Note: Window effects are exclusive to Windows 11.\n\n```yaml\nwindow_effects:\n  # Visual effects to apply to the focused window.\n  focused_window:\n    # Highlight the window with a colored border.\n    border:\n      enabled: true\n      color: \"#0000ff\"\n\n  # Visual effects to apply to non-focused windows.\n  other_windows:\n    border:\n      enabled: false\n      color: \"#d3d3d3\"\n```\n\n### Config: Window behavior\n\nThe `window_behavior` config option exists to customize the states that a window can be in (`tiling`, `floating`, `minimized`, and `fullscreen`).\n\n```yaml\nwindow_behavior:\n  # New windows are created in this state whenever possible.\n  # Allowed values: 'tiling', 'floating'.\n  initial_state: \"tiling\"\n\n  # Sets the default options for when a new window is created. This also\n  # changes the defaults for when the state change commands, like\n  # `set-floating`, are used without any flags.\n  state_defaults:\n    floating:\n      # Whether to center floating windows by default.\n      centered: true\n\n      # Whether to show floating windows as always on top.\n      shown_on_top: false\n\n    fullscreen:\n      # Maximize the window if possible. If the window doesn't have a\n      # maximize button, then it'll be made fullscreen normally instead.\n      maximized: false\n```\n\n### Config: Binding modes\n\nBinding modes are used to modify keybindings while GlazeWM is running.\n\nA binding mode can be enabled with `wm-enable-binding-mode --name <NAME>` and disabled with `wm-disable-binding-mode --name <NAME>`.\n\n```yaml\nbinding_modes:\n  # When enabled, the focused window can be resized via arrow keys or HJKL.\n  - name: \"resize\"\n    keybindings:\n      - commands: [\"resize --width -2%\"]\n        bindings: [\"h\", \"left\"]\n      - commands: [\"resize --width +2%\"]\n        bindings: [\"l\", \"right\"]\n      - commands: [\"resize --height +2%\"]\n        bindings: [\"k\", \"up\"]\n      - commands: [\"resize --height -2%\"]\n        bindings: [\"j\", \"down\"]\n      # Press enter/escape to return to default keybindings.\n      - commands: [\"wm-disable-binding-mode --name resize\"]\n        bindings: [\"escape\", \"enter\"]\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: How do I run GlazeWM on startup?**\n\nCreate a shortcut for the executable by right-clicking on the GlazeWM executable -> `Create shortcut`. Put the shortcut in your startup folder, which you can get to by entering `shell:startup` in the top bar in File Explorer.\n\n**Q: How can I create `<insert layout>`?**\n\nYou can create custom layouts by changing the tiling direction with `alt+v`. This changes where the next window is placed _in relation to the current window_. If the current window's direction is horizontal, the new window will be placed to the right of it. If it is vertical, it will be placed below it. This also applies when moving windows; the tiling direction of the stationary window will affect where the moved window will be placed.\n\nCommunity-made scripts like [Dutch-Raptor/GAT-GWM](https://github.com/Dutch-Raptor/GAT-GWM) and [burgr033/GlazeWM-autotiling-python](https://github.com/burgr033/GlazeWM-autotiling-python) can be used to automatically change the tiling direction. Native support for automatic layouts isn't _currently_ supported.\n\n**Q: How do I create a rule for `<insert application>`?**\n\nTo match a specific application, you need a command to execute and either the window's process name, title, or class name. For example, if you use Flow-Launcher and want to make the settings window float, you can do the following:\n\n```yaml\nwindow_rules:\n  - commands: [\"set-floating\"]\n    match:\n      - window_process: { equals: \"Flow.Launcher\" }\n        window_title: { equals: \"Settings\" }\n```\n\nPrograms like Winlister or AutoHotkey's Window Spy can be useful for getting info about a window.\n\n**Q: How can I ignore GlazeWM's keybindings when `<insert application>` is focused?**\n\nThis isn't currently supported, however, the keybinding `alt+shift+p` in the default config is used to disable all other keybindings until `alt+shift+p` is pressed again.\n\n[discord-badge]: https://img.shields.io/discord/1041662798196908052.svg?logo=discord&colorB=7289DA\n[discord-link]: https://discord.gg/ud6z3qjRvM\n[downloads-badge]: https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/glzr-io/glazewm/total?logo=github&logoColor=white\n[downloads-link]: https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm/releases\n[issues-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/good_first_issues-7057ff\n[issues-link]: https://github.com/orgs/glzr-io/projects/4/views/1?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=good+first+issue\n[demo-video]: resources/assets/demo.webp\n",

These services offer numerical weather predictions that are free to download. However, working with these models can be challenging, as it requires expertise in binary file formats, grid-systems, projections, and the fundamentals of weather predictions.\n\nLike many other weather APIs, Open-Meteo integrates high-resolution local and global weather models. Over 2 TB of data are downloaded and processed daily from multiple national weather services. The collected data is then stored in local files using a customized file format and compression technique to enhance access to time-series data such as a 14-day temperature forecast.\n\nIn contrast to other weather APIs, Open-Meteo provides complete access to its source code, and all data sources are openly listed, crediting the national weather services for their work. With Docker or prebuilt Ubuntu packages, it is possible to launch your own weather API within minutes. By providing the source code, users can conduct detailed verifications of the weather data processing and even make modifications themselves. Contributions are highly encouraged and welcomed.\n\nThe API is available for non-commercial use at no cost. Despite being free of charge, the forecast accuracy is top-notch. The API utilizes a vast array of local weather models with rapid updates, ensuring that the most precise forecast is generated for any location globally.\n\n## Resources\n\n- All API documentation can be found on https://open-meteo.com.

Heavily work-in-progress, expect breaking changes.\n\n![Preview](.github/preview.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- Lightweight\n- Configurable\n- Mouse & clipboard support\n- Attachments\n- Notifications\n- 2-Factor & QR code authentication\n- Discord-flavored markdown\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prebuilt binaries\n\nYou can download and install a [prebuilt binary here](https://nightly.link/ayn2op/discordo/workflows/ci/main) for Windows, macOS, or Linux.\n\n### Package managers\n\n- Arch Linux: `yay -S discordo-git`\n- Gentoo (available on the guru repos as a live ebuild): `emerge net-im/discordo`\n- FreeBSD: `pkg install discordo` or via the ports system `make -C /usr/ports/net-im/discordo install clean`.\n- Nix: Add `pkgs.discordo` to `environment.systemPackages` or `home.packages`.\n\n- Windows (Scoop):\n\n```sh\nscoop bucket add vvxrtues https://github.com/vvirtues/bucket\nscoop install discordo\n```\n\n### Building from source\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/ayn2op/discordo\ncd discordo\ngo build .\n```\n\n### Wayland clipboard support\n\n`wl-clipboard` is required for clipboard support.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Password\n\n1. Run the `discordo` executable with no arguments.\n\n2. Enter your email and password and click on the \"Login\" button to continue.\n\n### Token\n\nProvide the `token` command-line flag to the executable. \n\n```sh\ndiscordo --token \"[REDACTED_SECRET]\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, set the value of the `DISCORDO_TOKEN` environment variable to the authentication token.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can manually set the token to the keyring using the instructions [here](#manually-adding-token-to-keyring).\n\n### QR\n\n1. Run the `discordo` executable with no arguments.\n\n2. Click on the \"Login with QR\" button.\n\n3. Follow the instructions in the QR Login screen.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration file allows you to configure and customize the behavior, keybindings, and theme of the application.\n\n- Unix: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/discordo/config.toml` or `$HOME/.config/discordo/config.toml`\n- Darwin: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/discordo/config.toml`\n- Windows: `%AppData%/discordo/config.toml`\n\nDiscordo uses the default configuration if a configuration file is not found in the aforementioned path; however, the default configuration file is not written to the path. [The default configuration can be found here](./internal/config/config.toml).\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Manually adding token to keyring\n\nDo this if you get the error:\n\n> failed to get token from keyring: secret not found in keyring\n\n#### Windows\n\nRun the following command in a terminal window. Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN` with your authentication token.\n\n```sh\ncmdkey /add:discordo /user:token /pass:YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN\n```\n\n#### MacOS\n\nRun the following command in a terminal window. Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN` with your authentication token.\n\n```sh\nsecurity add-generic-password -s discordo -a token -w \"YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN\"\n```\n\n#### Linux\n\n1. Start the keyring daemon.\n\n```sh\neval $(gnome-keyring-daemon --start)\nexport $(gnome-keyring-daemon --start)\n```\n\n2. Create the `login` keyring if it does not exist already. See [GNOME/Keyring](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME/Keyring) for more information.\n\n3. Run the following command to create the `token` entry.\n\n```sh\nsecret-tool store --label=\"Discord Token\" service discordo username token\n```\n\n4. When it prompts for the password, paste your token, and hit enter to confirm.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Automated user accounts or \"self-bots\" are against Discord's Terms of Service. I am not responsible for any loss caused by using \"self-bots\" or Discordo.\n",

      "readme": "# Cloudflare Gateway Pi-hole Scripts (CGPS)\n\n![Cloudflare Gateway Analytics screenshot showing a thousand blocked DNS requests](.github/images/gateway_analytics.png)\n\nCloudflare Gateway allows you to create custom rules to filter HTTP, DNS, and network traffic based on your firewall policies. This is a collection of scripts that can be used to get a similar experience as if you were using Pi-hole, but with Cloudflare Gateway - so no servers to maintain or need to buy a Raspberry Pi!\n\n## About the individual scripts\n\n- `cf_list_delete.js` - Deletes all lists created by CGPS from Cloudflare Gateway. This is useful for subsequent runs.\n- `cf_list_create.js` - Takes a blocklist.txt file containing domains and creates lists in Cloudflare Gateway\n- `cf_gateway_rule_create.js` - Creates a Cloudflare Gateway rule to block all traffic if it matches the lists created by CGPS.\n- `cf_gateway_rule_delete.js` - Deletes the Cloudflare Gateway rule created by CGPS. Useful for subsequent runs.\n- `download_lists.js` - Initiates blocklist and whitelist download.\n\n## Features\n\n- Support for basic hosts files\n- Full support for domain lists\n- Automatically cleans up filter lists: removes duplicates, invalid domains, comments and more\n- Works **fully unattended**\n- **Allowlist support**, allowing you to prevent false positives and breakage by forcing trusted domains to always be unblocked.\n- Experimental **SNI-based filtering** that works independently of DNS settings, preventing unauthorized or malicious DNS changes from bypassing the filter.\n- Optional health check: Sends a ping request ensuring continuous monitoring and alerting for the workflow execution, or messages a Discord webhook with progress.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. Node.js installed on your machine\n2. Cloudflare [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) account - the Free plan is enough. Use the Cloudflare [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/) for details.\n3. Cloudflare email, API **token** with Zero Trust read and edit permissions, and account ID. See [here](https://github.com/mrrfv/cloudflare-gateway-pihole-scripts/blob/main/extended_guide.md#cloudflare_api_token) for more information about how to create the token.\n4. A file containing the domains you want to block - **max 300,000 domains for the free plan** - in the working directory named `blocklist.txt`. Mullvad provides awesome [DNS blocklists](https://github.com/mullvad/dns-blocklists) that work well with this project. A script that downloads recommended blocklists, `download_lists.js`, is included.\n5. Optional: You can whitelist domains by putting them in a file `allowlist.txt`. You can also use the `get_recomended_whitelist.sh` Bash script to get the recommended whitelists.\n6. Optional: A Discord (or similar) webhook URL to send notifications to.\n\n### Running locally\n\n1. Clone this repository.\n2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.\n3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.\n4. If you haven't downloaded any filters yourself, run the `node download_lists.js` command to download recommended filter lists (OISD Small and AdAway; about 50 000 domains).\n5. Run `node cf_list_create.js` to create the lists in Cloudflare Gateway. This will take a while.\n6. Run `node cf_gateway_rule_create.js` to create the firewall rule in Cloudflare Gateway.\n7. Profit! Time is money after all. You can update the lists by repeating steps 4, 5 and 6.\n\n### Running in GitHub Actions\n\nThese scripts can be run using GitHub Actions so your filters will be automatically updated and pushed to Cloudflare Gateway. This is useful if you are using a frequently updated blocklist.\n\nPlease note that:\n- GitHub Actions wasn't intended to be used for this purpose, therefore the local options are recommended.\n- the GitHub Action downloads the recommended blocklists and whitelist by default. You can change this behavior by setting Actions variables.\n\n1. Create a new empty, private repository. Forking or public repositories are discouraged, but supported - although the script never leaks your API keys and GitHub Actions secrets are automatically redacted from the logs, it's better to be safe than sorry. There is **no need to use the \"Sync fork\" button** if you're doing that! The GitHub Action downloads the latest code regardless of what's in your forked repository.\n2. Create the following GitHub Actions secrets in your repository settings:\n   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API Token with Zero Trust read and edit permissions\n   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID\n   - `CLOUDFLARE_LIST_ITEM_LIMIT`: The maximum number of blocked domains allowed for your Cloudflare Zero Trust plan. Default to 300,000. Optional if you are using the free plan.\n   - `PING_URL`: /Optional/ The HTTP(S) URL to ping (using curl) after the GitHub Action has successfully updated your filters. Useful for monitoring.\n   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: /Optional/ The Discord (or similar) webhook URL to send notifications to. Good for monitoring as well.\n3. Create the following GitHub Actions variables in your repository settings if you desire:\n   - `ALLOWLIST_URLS`: Uses your own allowlists. One URL per line. Recommended allowlists will be used if this variable is not provided.\n   - `BLOCKLIST_URLS`: Uses your own blocklists. One URL per line. Recommended blocklists will be used if this variable is not provided.\n   - `BLOCK_PAGE_ENABLED`: Enable showing block page if host is blocked.\n4. Create a new file in the repository named `.github/workflows/main.yml` with the contents of `auto_update_github_action.yml` found in this repository. The default settings will update your filters every week at 3 AM UTC. You can change this by editing the `schedule` property.\n5. Enable GitHub Actions in your repository settings.\n\n### DNS setup for Cloudflare Gateway\n\n1. Go to your Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard, and navigate to Networks -> Resolvers & Proxies -> DNS locations.\n2. Click on the default location or create one if it doesn't exist.\n3. Configure your router or device based on the provided DNS addresses.\n\nAlternatively, you can install the Cloudflare WARP client and log in to Zero Trust. This method proxies your traffic over Cloudflare servers, meaning it works similarly to a commercial VPN. You need to do this if you want to use the SNI-based filtering feature, as it requires Cloudflare to inspect your raw traffic (HTTPS remains encrypted if \"TLS decryption\" is disabled).\n\n### Malware blocking\n\nThe default filter lists are only optimized for ad & tracker blocking because Cloudflare Zero Trust itself comes with much more advanced security features. It's recommended that you create your own Cloudflare Gateway firewall policies that leverage those features on top of CGPS.\n\n### Dry runs\n\nTo see if e.g. your filter lists are valid without actually changing anything in your Cloudflare account, you can set the `DRY_RUN` environment variable to 1, either in `.env` or the regular way. This will only print info such as the lists that would be created or the amount of duplicate domains to the console.\n\n**Warning:** This currently only works for `cf_list_create.js`.\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 -->\n## Why not...\n\n### Pi-hole or Adguard Home?\n\n- Complex setup to get it working outside your home\n- Requires a Raspberry Pi\n\n### NextDNS?\n\n- DNS filtering is disabled after 300,000 queries per month on the free plan\n\n### Cloudflare Gateway?\n\n- Requires a valid payment card or PayPal account\n- Limit of 300k domains on the free plan\n\n### a hosts file?\n\n- Potential performance issues, especially on [Windows](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/issues/93)\n- No filter updates\n- Doesn't work for your mobile device\n- No statistics on how many domains you've blocked\n\n## License\n\nMIT License.

If you just want to use the emulator as an end user, download the [**QtLauncher**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadps4-qtlauncher/releases) instead.\n\nIf you encounter problems or have doubts, do not hesitate to look at the [**Quickstart**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/wiki/I.-Quick-start-%5BUsers%5D).\\\nTo verify that a game works, you can look at [**shadPS4 Game Compatibility**](https://github.com/shadps4-compatibility/shadps4-game-compatibility).\\\nTo discuss shadPS4 development, suggest ideas or to ask for help, join our [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/bFJxfftGW6).\\\nTo get the latest news, go to our [**X (Twitter)**](https://x.com/shadps4) or our [**website**](https://shadps4.net/).\\\nYou can donate to the project via our [**Kofi page**](https://ko-fi.com/shadps4).\n\n# Status\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> shadPS4 is early in development, don't expect a flawless experience.\n\nCurrently, the emulator can successfully run games like [**Bloodborne**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sZgWyVflFM), [**Dark Souls Remastered**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3PA-Xwszts), [**Red Dead Redemption**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al7yz_5nLag), and many other games.\n\n# Why\n\nThis project began for fun. Given our limited free time, it may take some time before shadPS4 can run more complex games, but we're committed to making small, regular updates.\n\n# Building\n\n## Windows\n\nCheck the build instructions for [**Windows**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/building-windows.md).\n\n## Linux\n\nCheck the build instructions for [**Linux**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/building-linux.md).\n\n## macOS\n\nCheck the build instructions for [**macOS**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/building-macos.md).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> macOS users need at least macOS 15.4 to run shadPS4. Due to GPU issues there are currently heavy bugs on Intel Macs.\n\n# Usage examples\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> For a user-friendly GUI, download the [**QtLauncher**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadps4-qtlauncher/releases).\n\nTo get the list of all available commands and also a more detailed description of what each command does, please refer to the `--help` flag's output.\n\nBelow is a list of commonly used command patterns:\n```sh\nshadPS4 CUSA00001 # Searches for a game folder called CUSA00001 in the list of game install folders, and boots it.\nshadPS4 --fullscreen true --config-clean CUSA00001    # the game argument is always the last one,\nshadPS4 -g CUSA00001 --fullscreen true --config-clean # ...unless manually specified otherwise.\nshadPS4 /path/to/game.elf # Boots a PS4 ELF file directly. Useful if you want to boot an executable that is not named eboot.bin.\nshadPS4 CUSA00001 -- -flag1 -flag2 # Passes '-flag1' and '-flag2' to the game executable in argv.\n```\n\n# Debugging and reporting issues\n\nFor more information on how to test, debug and report issues with the emulator or games, read the [**Debugging documentation**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/documents/Debugging/Debugging.md).\n\n# Keyboard and Mouse Mappings\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Some keyboards may also require you to hold the Fn key to use the F\\* keys. Mac users should use the Command key instead of Control, and need to use Command+F11 for full screen to avoid conflicting with system key bindings.\n\n| Button | Function |\n|-------------|-------------|\nF10 | FPS Counter\nCtrl+F10 | Video Debug Info\nF11 | Fullscreen\nF12 | Trigger RenderDoc Capture\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Xbox and DualShock controllers work out of the box.\n\n| Controller button | Keyboard equivalent |\n|-------------|-------------|\nLEFT AXIS UP | W |\nLEFT AXIS DOWN | S |\nLEFT AXIS LEFT | A |\nLEFT AXIS RIGHT | D |\nRIGHT AXIS UP | I |\nRIGHT AXIS DOWN | K |\nRIGHT AXIS LEFT | J |\nRIGHT AXIS RIGHT | L |\nTRIANGLE | Numpad 8 or C |\nCIRCLE | Numpad 6 or B |\nCROSS | Numpad 2 or N |\nSQUARE | Numpad 4 or V |\nPAD UP | UP |\nPAD DOWN | DOWN |\nPAD LEFT | LEFT |\nPAD RIGHT | RIGHT |\nOPTIONS | RETURN |\nBACK BUTTON / TOUCH PAD | SPACE |\nL1 | Q |\nR1 | U |\nL2 | E |\nR2 | O |\nL3 | X |\nR3 | M |\n\nKeyboard and mouse inputs can be customized in the settings menu by clicking the Controller button, and further details and help on controls are  also found there. Custom bindings are saved per-game. Inputs support up to three keys per binding, mouse buttons, mouse movement mapped to joystick input, and more.\n\n\n# Firmware files\n\nshadPS4 can load some PlayStation 4 firmware files.\nThe following firmware modules are supported and must be placed in shadPS4's `sys_modules` folder.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n| Modules                 | Modules                 | Modules                 | Modules                 |  \n|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|  \n| libSceCesCs.sprx        | libSceFont.sprx         | libSceFontFt.sprx       | libSceFreeTypeOt.sprx   |\n| libSceJson.sprx         | libSceJson2.sprx        | libSceLibcInternal.sprx | libSceNgs2.sprx         |  \n| libSceUlt.sprx          |                         |                         |                         |\n\n</div>\n\n> [!Caution]\n> The above modules are required to run the games properly and must be dumped from your legally owned PlayStation 4 console.\n\n\n\n# Main team\n\n- [**georgemoralis**](https://github.com/georgemoralis)\n- [**psucien**](https://github.com/psucien)\n- [**viniciuslrangel**](https://github.com/viniciuslrangel)\n- [**roamic**](https://github.com/roamic)\n- [**squidbus**](https://github.com/squidbus)\n- [**frodo**](https://github.com/baggins183)\n- [**Stephen Miller**](https://github.com/StevenMiller123)\n- [**kalaposfos13**](https://github.com/kalaposfos13)\n\nLogo is done by [**Xphalnos**](https://github.com/Xphalnos)\n\n# Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute, please read the [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.\\\nOpen a PR and we'll check it :)\n\n\n# Special Thanks\n\nA few noteworthy teams/projects who've helped us along the way are:\n\n- [**Panda3DS**](https://github.com/wheremyfoodat/Panda3DS): A multiplatform 3DS emulator from our co-author wheremyfoodat.

Its successor is available [here](https://github.com/AngelAuraMC/Amethyst-Android).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* [Introduction](#introduction)\n* [Getting PojavLauncher](#getting-pojavlauncher)\n* [Building](#building)\n    * [Quick Build (Recommended)](#quick-build-recommended)\n    * [Detailed Build](#detailed-build)\n* [Current Status](#current-status)\n* [Known Issues](#known-issues)\n* [FAQ](#faq)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n* [Support](#support)\n* [License](#license)\n* [Credits & Dependencies](#credits--dependencies)\n* [Roadmap](#roadmap)\n\n## Introduction\n\n* PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk)\n* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 1.21 snapshots (including Combat Test versions)\n* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported.\n* This repository contains source code for Android. For iOS/iPadOS, check out [PojavLauncher_iOS](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS).\n\n## Getting PojavLauncher\n\nYou can get PojavLauncher via three methods:\n\n1. **Releases:** Download the prebuilt app from our [stable releases](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases) or [automatic builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions).\n2. **Google Play:** Get it from Google Play by clicking on this badge: [![Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kdt.pojavlaunch)\n3. **Build from Source:** Follow the [building instructions](#building) below.\n\n## Building\n\n### Quick Build (Recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to build PojavLauncher is to use the pre-built JREs provided by our CI.\n\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher.git`\n2. Build the launcher: `./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug` (Use `gradlew.bat` on Windows)\n\nThe built APK will be located in `app_pojavlauncher/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.\n\n### Detailed Build\n\nIf you need more control over the build process, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Download the `jre8-pojav` artifact from our [CI auto builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions).  This package contains pre-built JREs for all supported architectures.  If you need to build the JRE yourself, follow the instructions in the [android-openjdk-build-multiarch](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch) repository.\n\n2. **LWJGL:** The build instructions for the custom LWJGL are available over the [LWJGL repository](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3).\n\n3. **Language List:** Because languages are auto-added by Crowdin, you need to run the language list generator before building. In the project directory, run:\n   * Linux/macOS:\n     ```bash\n     chmod +x scripts/languagelist_updater.sh\n     bash scripts/languagelist_updater.sh\n     ```\n   * Windows:\n     ```batch\n     scripts\\languagelist_updater.bat\n     ```\n\n4. **Build GLFW stub:** `./gradlew :jre_lwjgl3glfw:build`\n\n5. **Build the launcher:** `./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug` (Replace `gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` on Windows).\n\n## Current Status\n\n* [x] OpenJDK 8 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64\n* [x] OpenJDK 17 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64\n* [x] OpenJDK 21 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64\n* [x] Headless mod installer\n* [x] Mod installer with GUI\n* [x] OpenGL in OpenJDK environment\n* [x] OpenAL (works on most devices)\n* [x] Support for Minecraft 1.12.2 and below\n* [x] Support for Minecraft 1.13 and above\n* [x] Support for Minecraft 1.17 (22w13a) and above\n* [x] Game surface zooming\n* [x] New input pipe rewritten to native code\n* [x] Rewritten entire controls system\n* [ ] More to come!\n\n## Known Issues\n\nSee our [issue tracker](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/issues) for a list of known issues and their current status.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee our [wiki](https://pojavlauncherteam.github.io/) for more information.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

      "readme": "# Moonlight PC\n\n[Moonlight PC](https://moonlight-stream.org) is an open source PC client for NVIDIA GameStream and [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine).\n\nMoonlight also has mobile versions for [Android](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios).\n\nYou can follow development on our [Discord server](https://moonlight-stream.org/discord) and help translate Moonlight into your language on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/moonlight/moonlight-qt/).\n\n [![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/build.yml?branch=master)](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\n [![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/total)](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/releases)\n [![Translation Status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/moonlight/-/moonlight-qt/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/moonlight/moonlight-qt/)\n\n## Features\n - Hardware accelerated video decoding on Windows, Mac, and Linux\n - H.264, HEVC, and AV1 codec support (AV1 requires Sunshine and a supported host GPU)\n - YUV 4:4:4 support (Sunshine only)\n - HDR streaming support\n - 7.1 surround sound audio support\n - 10-point multitouch support (Sunshine only)\n - Gamepad support with force feedback and motion controls for up to 16 players\n - Support for both pointer capture (for games) and direct mouse control (for remote desktop)\n - Support for passing system-wide keyboard shortcuts like Alt+Tab to the host\n \n## Downloads\n- [Windows, macOS, and Steam Link](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/releases)\n- [Snap (for Ubuntu-based Linux distros)](https://snapcraft.io/moonlight)\n- [Flatpak (for other Linux distros)](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.moonlight_stream.Moonlight)\n- [AppImage](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/releases)\n- [Raspberry Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/Installing-Moonlight-Qt-on-Raspberry-Pi-4)\n- [Generic ARM 32-bit and 64-bit Debian packages](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/Installing-Moonlight-Qt-on-ARM%E2%80%90based-Single-Board-Computers) (not for Raspberry Pi)\n- [Experimental RISC-V Debian packages](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/Installing-Moonlight-Qt-on-RISC%E2%80%90V-Single-Board-Computers)\n- [NVIDIA Jetson and Nintendo Switch (Ubuntu L4T)](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/Installing-Moonlight-Qt-on-Linux4Tegra-(L4T)-Ubuntu)\n\n### Nightly Builds\n- [Downloads](https://nightly.link/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt/workflows/build/master)\n\n#### Special Thanks\n\n[![Hosted By: Cloudsmith](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSS%20hosting%20by-cloudsmith-blue?logo=cloudsmith&style=flat-square)](https://cloudsmith.com)\n\nHosting for Moonlight's Debian and L4T package repositories is graciously provided for free by [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com).\n\n## Building\n\n### Windows Build Requirements\n* Qt 6.7 SDK or later (earlier versions may work but are not officially supported)\n* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (Community edition is fine)\n* Select **MSVC** option during Qt installation. MinGW is not supported.\n* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (only if building installers for non-development PCs)\n* Graphics Tools (only if running debug builds)\n  * Install \"Graphics Tools\" in the Optional Features page of the Windows Settings app.\n  * Alternatively, run `dism /online /add-capability /capabilityname:Tools.Graphics.DirectX~~~~0.0.1.0` and reboot.\n\n### macOS Build Requirements\n* Qt 6.7 SDK or later (earlier versions may work but are not officially supported)\n* Xcode 14 or later (earlier versions may work but are not officially supported)\n* [create-dmg](https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg) (only if building DMGs for use on non-development Macs)\n\n### Linux/Unix Build Requirements\n* Qt 6 is recommended, but Qt 5.12 or later is also supported (replace `qmake6` with `qmake` when using Qt 5).\n* GCC or Clang\n* FFmpeg 4.0 or later\n* Install the required packages:\n  * Debian/Ubuntu:\n    * Base Requirements: `libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libopus-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libssl-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libva-dev libvdpau-dev libxkbcommon-dev wayland-protocols libdrm-dev`\n    * Qt 6 (Recommended): `qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev libqt6svg6-dev qt6-wayland qml6-module-qtquick-controls qml6-module-qtquick-templates qml6-module-qtquick-layouts qml6-module-qtqml-workerscript qml6-module-qtquick-window qml6-module-qtquick`\n    * Qt 5: `qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-layouts qml-module-qtquick-window2 qml-module-qtquick2 qtwayland5`\n  * RedHat/Fedora (RPM Fusion repo required):\n    * Base Requirements: `openssl-devel SDL2-devel SDL2_ttf-devel ffmpeg-devel libva-devel libvdpau-devel opus-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel alsa-lib-devel libdrm-devel`\n    * Qt 6 (Recommended): `qt6-qtsvg-devel qt6-qtdeclarative-devel`\n    * Qt 5: `qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-qtquickcontrols2-devel`\n* Building the Vulkan renderer requires a `libplacebo-dev`/`libplacebo-devel` version of at least v7.349.0 and FFmpeg 6.1 or later.\n\n### Steam Link Build Requirements\n* [Steam Link SDK](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamlink-sdk) cloned on your build system\n* STEAMLINK_SDK_PATH environment variable set to the Steam Link SDK path\n\n**Steam Link Hardware Limitations**  \nMoonlight builds for Steam Link are subject to hardware limitations of the Steam Link device:\n* Maximum resolution: **1080p (1920x1080)**\n* Maximum framerate: **60 FPS**\n* Maximum video bitrate: **40 Mbps**\n* **HDR streaming is not supported** on the original hardware\n\n### Build Setup Steps\n1. Install the latest Qt SDK (and optionally, the Qt Creator IDE) from https://www.qt.io/download\n    * You can install Qt via Homebrew on macOS, but you will need to use `brew install qt --with-debug` to be able to create debug builds of Moonlight.\n    * You may also use your Linux distro's package manager for the Qt SDK as long as the packages are Qt 5.12 or later.\n    * This step is not required for building on Steam Link, because the Steam Link SDK includes Qt 5.14.\n2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` from within `moonlight-qt/`\n3. Open the project in Qt Creator or build from qmake on the command line.\n    * To build a binary for use on non-development machines, use the scripts in the `scripts` folder.\n        * For Windows builds, use `scripts\\build-arch.bat` and `scripts\\generate-bundle.bat`. Execute these scripts from the root of the repository within a Qt command prompt. Ensure  7-Zip binary directory is on your `%PATH%`.\n        * For macOS builds, use `scripts/generate-dmg.sh`. Execute this script from the root of the repository and ensure Qt's `bin` folder is in your `$PATH`.\n        * For Steam Link builds, run `scripts/build-steamlink-app.sh` from the root of the repository.\n    * To build from the command line for development use on macOS or Linux, run `qmake6 moonlight-qt.pro` then `make debug` or `make release`\n    * To create an embedded build for a single-purpose device, use `qmake6 \"CONFIG+=embedded\" moonlight-qt.pro` and build normally.\n        * This build will lack windowed mode, Discord/Help links, and other features that don't make sense on an embedded device.\n        * For platforms with poor GPU performance, add `\"CONFIG+=gpuslow\"` to prefer direct KMSDRM rendering over GL/Vulkan renderers. Direct KMSDRM rendering can use dedicated YUV/RGB conversion and scaling hardware rather than slower GPU shaders for these operations.\n\n## Contribute\n1. Fork us\n2. Write code\n3.

Just use Helix.\n\nHelixDB primarily operates with a graph + vector data model, but it can also support KV, documents, and relational data.\n\n### Get started with HelixDB\n\n<div align=\"center\">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n    <img src=\"/assets/readmeinit.gif\" alt=\"Helix CLI Demo\" width=\"100%\">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n</div>  \n\n--- \n\n## Key Features\n\n|                         |                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Built-in MCP tools**  | Helix has built-in MCP support to allow your agents to discover data and walk the graph rather than generating human readable queries. |\n| **Built-in Embeddings** | No need to embed your data before sending it to Helix, just use the `Embed` function to vectorize text.                                |\n| **Tooling for RAG**     | HelixDB has a built-in vector search, keyword search, and graph traversals that can be used to power any type of RAG applications.     |\n| **Secure by Default**   | HelixDB is private by default. You can only access your data through your compiled HelixQL queries.                                    |\n| **Ultra-Low Latency**   | Helix is built in Rust and uses LMDB as its storage engine to provide extremely low latencies.                                         |\n| **Type-Safe Queries**   | HelixQL is 100% type-safe, which lets you develop and deploy with the confidence that your queries will execute in production          |\n\n## Getting Started\n\n#### Helix CLI\n\nStart by installing the Helix CLI tool to deploy Helix locally.\n\n1. Install CLI\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -sSL \"https://install.helix-db.com\" | bash\n   ```\n\n2. Initialize a project\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir <path-to-project> && cd <path-to-project>\n   helix init\n   ```\n\n3. Write queries\n\n   Open your newly created `.hx` files and start writing your schema and queries.\n   Head over to [our docs](https://docs.helix-db.com/documentation/hql/hql) for more information about writing queries.\n\n   ```js\n   N::User {\n      INDEX name: String,\n      age: U32\n   }\n\n   QUERY getUser(user_name: String) =>\n      user <- N<User>({name: user_name})\n      RETURN user\n   ```\n\n4. (Optional) Check your queries compile\n\n   ```bash\n   helix check\n   ```\n\n5. Deploy your queries to their API endpoints\n\n   ```bash\n   helix push dev\n   ```\n\n6. Start calling them using our [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-ts) or [Python SDK](https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-py). For example:\n\n   ```typescript\n   import HelixDB from \"helix-ts\";\n\n   // Create a new HelixDB client\n   // The default port is 6969\n   const client = new HelixDB();\n\n   // Query the database\n   await client.query(\"addUser\", {\n     name: \"John\",\n     age: 20,\n   });\n\n   // Get the created user\n   const user = await client.query(\"getUser\", {\n     user_name: \"John\",\n   });\n\n   console.log(user);\n   ```\n\n## License\n\nHelixDB is licensed under the The AGPL (Affero General Public License).\n\n## Commercial Support\n\nHelixDB is available as a managed service for selected users, if you're interested in using Helix's managed service or want enterprise support, [contact](mailto:founders@helix-db.com) us for more information and deployment options.\n\n---\n\nJust Use Helix\n",

Netronome gracefully handles missing tools\n\n## Installation\n\n### Linux Generic\n\n1. **Download and Install**\n\n   ```bash\n   wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/autobrr/netronome/releases/latest | grep download | grep linux_x86_64 | cut -d\\\" -f4)\n   tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf netronome*.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n2. **Create Systemd Service** (Recommended)\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/netronome@.service > /dev/null <<EOF\n   [Unit]\n   Description=netronome service for %i\n   After=syslog.target network-online.target\n\n   [Service]\n   Type=simple\n   User=%i\n   Group=%i\n   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/netronome serve --config=/home/%i/.config/netronome/config.toml\n\n   [Install]\n   WantedBy=multi-user.target\n   EOF\n   ```\n\n3. **Enable and Start**\n   ```bash\n   systemctl enable --now netronome@$USER\n   ```\n\n### Windows Generic\n\n1. **Download and Install**\n```cmd\nGet the latest binary from https://github.com/autobrr/netronome/releases\nUnzip the release into a folder\nPlace any third party binaries in the same folder\nAdd the folder to Windows environment variables - restart explorer.exe (and any open terminals)\n```\n\n2. **Create a Windows Task Schedule**\n```cmd\nhttps://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-automated-task-using-task-scheduler-windows-10\n```\n\n3. **Create Config**\n```cmd\nRun `netronome generate-config`\nEdit config.toml to suit `C:\\Users\\{USERNAME}\\.config\\netronome`\n```\n\n### Docker Installation\n\nQuick Docker deployment with automatic dependency installation:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository (for docker-compose files)\ngit clone https://github.com/autobrr/netronome.git\ncd netronome\n\n# Basic setup with SQLite\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n# Or with PostgreSQL for better performance\ndocker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d\n```\n\nThe Docker image includes all dependencies (iperf3, librespeed-cli, traceroute, mtr, vnstat) pre-installed, so you don't need to install them separately. For Tailscale integration with Docker, see the [Docker Tailscale Sidecar Guide](docs/docker-tailscale-sidecar.md).\n\n## Basic Configuration\n\n### First Run Setup\n\n1. **Generate Configuration**\n\n   ```bash\n   netronome generate-config\n   ```\n\n   This creates `~/.config/netronome/config.toml` with default settings.\n\n2. **Start Server**\n\n   ```bash\n   netronome serve\n   ```\n\n3. **Access Interface**\n   Navigate to `http://localhost:7575` and register your account through the web interface.\n\n   To access from other devices on your network, change the host in config.toml from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0`.\n\n### Authentication\n\nNetronome supports multiple authentication methods:\n\n#### Built-in Authentication\n\nUsers can register directly through the web interface on first visit. For automation or admin purposes, you can also manage users via CLI:\n\n```bash\nnetronome create-user <username>     # Create user via CLI\nnetronome change-password <username>  # Change password via CLI\n```\n\n#### OpenID Connect (OIDC)\n\nConfigure via environment variables:\n\n```bash\nexport NETRONOME__OIDC_ISSUER=https://your-provider.com\nexport NETRONOME__OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id\nexport NETRONOME__OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret\nexport NETRONOME__OIDC_REDIRECT_URL=https://netronome.example.com/api/auth/oidc/callback\n```\n\n#### IP Whitelisting\n\nAdd to `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[auth]\nwhitelist = [\"127.0.0.1/32\", \"192.168.1.0/24\"]\n```\n\n### Database\n\n#### SQLite (Default)\n\nNo additional setup required. Database file is created automatically.\n\n#### PostgreSQL\n\nConfigure via environment variables:\n\n```bash\nexport NETRONOME__DB_TYPE=postgres\nexport NETRONOME__DB_HOST=localhost\nexport NETRONOME__DB_PORT=5432\nexport NETRONOME__DB_USER=postgres\nexport NETRONOME__DB_PASSWORD=your-password\nexport NETRONOME__DB_NAME=netronome\n```\n\n### Reverse Proxy with Base URL\n\nTo serve Netronome under a subpath (e.g., `/netronome`) behind nginx:\n\n#### 1. Configure Netronome\n\nSet the base URL in your `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[server]\nhost = \"127.0.0.1\"  # Listen only on localhost since nginx will proxy\nport = 7575\nbase_url = \"/netronome\"  # The subpath you want to use\n```\n\n#### 2. Configure nginx\n\nAdd this location block to your nginx configuration:\n\n```nginx\n# Redirect /netronome to /netronome/\nlocation = /netronome {\n    return 301 /netronome/;\n}\n\nlocation /netronome/ {\n    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7575;\n    proxy_http_version 1.1;\n    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n    proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n    proxy_buffering off;\n    proxy_cache off;\n    proxy_read_timeout 86400;\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! The minimal configuration above handles WebSocket/SSE for real-time features.\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n### Home Network Monitoring\n\nMonitor your internet connection quality:\n\n1. Schedule hourly speed tests to your ISP\n2. Set up packet loss monitoring to `8.8.8.8` or `1.1.1.1`\n3. Configure notifications when speeds drop below expected thresholds\n\n### Multi-Site Infrastructure\n\nMonitor connectivity between office locations:\n\n1. Deploy agents at each site\n2. Configure iperf3 tests between locations\n3. Use Tailscale for secure agent communication\n4. Set up alerts for degraded inter-site connectivity\n\n### Server Health Monitoring\n\nTrack server performance metrics:\n\n1. Install agents on production servers\n2. Monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, and temperatures\n3. Configure threshold alerts for resource exhaustion\n4. Track bandwidth usage patterns\n\n## Advanced Configuration\n\n### System Monitoring\n\nDeploy monitoring agents on remote servers for full system visibility.\n\n#### Quick Agent Installation\n\n```bash\ncurl -sL https://netrono.me/install-agent | bash\n```\n\nThe script provides interactive setup for:\n\n- Network interface selection\n- API key configuration\n- Listening address and port\n- Systemd service creation\n- Automatic updates\n\n#### Manual Agent Setup\n\n```bash\n# Basic agent\nnetronome agent\n\n# With authentication\nnetronome agent --api-key your-secret-key\n\n# Custom configuration\nnetronome agent --host 192.168.1.100 --port 8300 --interface eth0\n```\n\n#### Agent Configuration\n\nAdd to `config.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[agent]\nhost = \"0.0.0.0\"\nport = 8200\ninterface = \"\"  # Empty for all interfaces\napi_key = \"your-secret-key\"\ndisk_includes = [\"/mnt/storage\"]  # Additional mounts to monitor\ndisk_excludes = [\"/boot\", \"/tmp\"] # Mounts to exclude\n\n[monitor]\nenabled = true\n```\n\n### Packet Loss Monitoring\n\nContinuous network monitoring with MTR integration and performance tracking.\n\n#### Key Features\n\n- Flexible scheduling (10 seconds to 24 hours or exact daily times)\n- Real-time progress indicators\n- Historical performance charts\n- Cross-platform support with privilege fallback\n\n#### Important Notes\n\n- MTR requires elevated privileges for full functionality\n- Overall packet loss can be 0% even with intermediate hop timeouts (normal behavior)\n\n### Tailscale Integration\n\nNative Tailscale support for secure mesh networking without port exposure.\n\n#### Agent Setup\n\n```bash\n# Basic Tailscale agent\nnetronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-auth-key tskey-auth-YOUR-KEY\n\n# Use existing tailscaled\nnetronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-method host\n\n# Custom hostname\nnetronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-hostname \"webserver-prod\"\n```\n\n#### Server Configuration\n\n```toml\n[tailscale]\nenabled = true\nmethod = \"auto\"  # auto, host, or tsnet\nauth_key = \"\"    # Required for tsnet mode\nhostname = \"\"    # Optional custom hostname\n\n# Discovery settings\nauto_discover = true\ndiscovery_interval = \"5m\"\ndiscovery_port = 8200\n```\n\n### Docker Agent Integration\n\nYou may wish to run an agent inside of a Docker container, for example, to monitor VPN traffic on a container like Gluetun.\nBy default, this will not work, because the container cannot access the host's network interface for statistics.\n\nTo monitor bandwidth on VPN networked containers, you will need to run both the agent, and a **vnstat** container in the same network as your VPN container.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Docker Agent Integration Compose Example</summary>\n  \n```yml\nservices:\n  # Gluetun -

OpenVPN or Gluetun custom provider\n* `wg0` - WireGuard\n\n#### Limiting Monitored Interfaces\n\nBy default, `vnstat` will monitor all detected interfaces (e.g., eth0 and tun0). To monitor only the VPN tunnel:\n\n```sh\n# Remove unwanted interfaces from vnstat\ndocker exec vnstat vnstat --remove -i eth0 --force\n\n# Verify only tun0 is being tracked\ndocker exec vnstat vnstat\n```\n\n### GeoIP Configuration\n\nEnable country flags and ASN information in traceroute results (optional):\n\n1. Sign up for a free license at [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)\n2. Download the GeoLite2 databases (Country and ASN)\n3. Add paths to your config:\n   ```toml\n   [geoip]\n   country_database_path = \"/path/to/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb\"\n   asn_database_path = \"/path/to/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb\"\n   ```\n\nNetronome works perfectly without GeoIP - this just adds visual country indicators.\n\n### Notifications\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\".github/assets/notifications.png\" alt=\"Notifications Configuration\">\n</p>\n\nConfigure notifications through the web interface at **Settings > Notifications**.\n\n#### Supported Services\n\n- Discord, Telegram, Slack, Teams\n- Email (SMTP), Pushover, Pushbullet\n- Gotify, Matrix, Ntfy, Webhook\n- [And 15+ more via Shoutrrr](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/)\n\n#### Notification Events\n\n- Speed test completion, failures, threshold breaches\n- Packet loss state changes (degraded/recovered)\n- Agent metrics: CPU, memory, disk, bandwidth, temperature thresholds\n\n### Scheduling\n\nTwo scheduling types supported:\n\n#### Duration-based Intervals\n\n```\n\"30s\", \"5m\", \"1h\", \"24h\"\n```\n\nAdds 1-300 seconds of random jitter to prevent simultaneous execution.\n\n#### Exact Time Intervals\n\n```\n\"exact:14:30\"           # Daily at 2:30 PM\n\"exact:00:00,12:00\"     # Midnight and noon daily\n```\n\nAdds 1-60 seconds of random jitter.\n\n## Reference\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nAll configuration options can be set via environment variables using the `NETRONOME__` prefix.

Change the host in your config from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0` or set `NETRONOME__HOST=0.0.0.0`.\n\n**Q: Do I need all the external dependencies?**\n\nNo, Netronome works without them. You only need:\n\n- `iperf3` for iperf3 speed tests\n- `librespeed-cli` for LibreSpeed tests\n- Speedtest.net works out of the box\n\n### Common Issues\n\n**Q: \"Port 7575 already in use\" error?**\n\nAnother service is using the port. Either stop that service or change Netronome's port in the config.\n\n**Q: Speed tests are slower than expected?**\n\n1. Ensure you're testing to a nearby server\n2. Check if other devices are using bandwidth\n3. Try different test providers (some ISPs throttle specific tests)\n4. For iperf3, ensure the server supports your connection speed\n\n### Temperature Monitoring\n\n**Q: Why don't I see disk temperatures?**\n\nDisk temperature monitoring requires:\n\n1. Platform support (Linux/macOS for SATA, all platforms for NVMe)\n2. Elevated privileges (root/sudo for SMART access)\n3. SMART-enabled drives with temperature sensors\n\n### Network Diagnostics\n\n**Q: Why do I see 0% packet loss but 100% loss at intermediate hops?**\n\nThis is normal behavior. Intermediate routers often block/rate-limit ICMP responses for security while still forwarding traffic. Overall packet loss measures end-to-end connectivity, which is the primary indicator of network performance.\n\n### Agent Discovery\n\n**Q: Tailscale agent not discovered?**\n\n- Ensure agent runs on discovery port (default 8200)\n- Verify both server and agent are on same Tailnet\n- Check connectivity: `tailscale ping <agent-hostname>`\n- Test endpoint: `curl http://<agent-hostname>:8200/netronome/info`\n\n## Building from Source\n\nBuilding Netronome creates a single binary with the frontend embedded:\n\n### With Full SMART Support (Linux/macOS)\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/autobrr/netronome\ncd netronome\nmake build  # Builds frontend, embeds it, compiles Go binary\n```\n\n### Without SMART Support\n\n```bash\n# First build frontend\ncd web && pnpm install && pnpm build && cd ..\n# Then build Go binary\nCGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags nosmart -o bin/netronome ./cmd/netronome\n```\n\n### Docker Build\n\n```bash\nmake docker-build\nmake docker-run\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.

Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\n* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).\n\n[Learn how to use React in your project](https://react.dev/learn).\n\n## Installation\n\nReact has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:\n\n* Use [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn) to get a taste of React.\n* [Add React to an Existing Project](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project) to use as little or as much React as you need.\n* [Create a New React App](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).\n\nCheck out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.\n\nThe documentation is divided into several sections:\n\n* [Quick Start](https://react.dev/learn)\n* [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)\n* [Thinking in React](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)\n* [Installation](https://react.dev/learn/installation)\n* [Describing the UI](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)\n* [Adding Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity)\n* [Managing State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state)\n* [Advanced Guides](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches)\n* [API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)\n* [Where to Get Support](https://react.dev/community)\n* [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)\n\nYou can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev).\n\n## Examples\n\nWe have several examples [on the website](https://react.dev/). Here is the first one to get you started:\n\n```jsx\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nfunction HelloMessage({ name }) {\n  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;\n}\n\nconst root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));\nroot.render(<HelloMessage name=\"Taylor\" />);\n```\n\nThis example will render \"Hello Taylor\" into a container on the page.\n\nYou'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://react.dev/learn#writing-markup-with-jsx). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.\n\n### [Code of Conduct](https://code.fb.com/codeofconduct)\n\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://code.fb.com/codeofconduct) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n### [Contributing Guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)\n\nRead our [contributing guide](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html) to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React.\n\n### [Good First Issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/labels/good%20first%20issue)\n\nTo help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/labels/good%20first%20issue) that contain bugs that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.\n\n### License\n\nReact is [MIT licensed](./LICENSE).\n",

      "readme": "# Gson\n\nGson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.\nGson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.\n\nThere are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals.\n\n> [!NOTE]\\\n> Gson is currently in maintenance mode; existing bugs will be fixed, but large new features will likely not be added. If you want to add a new feature, please first search for existing GitHub issues, or create a new one to discuss the feature and get feedback.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> Gson's main focus is on Java. Using it with other JVM languages such as Kotlin or Scala might work fine in many cases, but language-specific features such as Kotlin's non-`null` types or constructors with default arguments are not supported. This can lead to confusing and incorrect behavior.\\\n> When using languages other than Java, prefer a JSON library with explicit support for that language.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> Gson is not a recommended library for interacting with JSON on Android. The open-ended reflection in the Gson runtime doesn't play nicely with shrinking/optimization/obfuscation passes that Android release apps should perform.\\\n> If your app or library may be running on Android, consider using [Kotlin Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/docs/basic-serialization.md#basics) or [Moshi's Codegen](https://github.com/square/moshi?tab=readme-ov-file#codegen),\n> which use code generation instead of reflection. This avoids Gson's runtime crashes when optimizations are applied (usually due to the fields missing or being obfuscated), and results in faster performance on Android devices.\n> The Moshi APIs may be more familiar to users who already know Gson.\n> If you still want to use Gson and attempt to avoid these crashes, you can see how to do so [here](Troubleshooting.md#proguard-r8).\n\n### Goals\n  * Provide simple `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa\n  * Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON\n  * Extensive support of Java Generics\n  * Allow custom representations for objects\n  * Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)\n\n### Download\n\nGradle:\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n  implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.13.2'\n}\n```\n\nMaven:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>\n  <artifactId>gson</artifactId>\n  <version>2.13.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n[Gson jar downloads](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.google.code.gson/gson) are available from Maven Central.\n\n![Build Status](https://github.com/google/gson/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)\n\n### Requirements\n#### Minimum Java version\n- Gson 2.12.0 and newer: Java 8\n- Gson 2.9.0 to 2.11.0: Java 7\n- Gson 2.8.9 and older: Java 6\n\nDespite supporting older Java versions, Gson also provides a JPMS module descriptor (module name `com.google.gson`) for users of Java 9 or newer.\n\n#### JPMS dependencies (Java 9+)\nThese are the optional Java Platform Module System (JPMS) JDK modules which Gson depends on.\nThis only applies when running Java 9 or newer.\n\n- `java.sql` (optional since Gson 2.8.9)\\\nWhen this module is present, Gson provides default adapters for some SQL date and time classes.\n\n- `jdk.unsupported`, respectively class `sun.misc.Unsafe` (optional)\\\nWhen this module is present, Gson can use the `Unsafe` class to create instances of classes without no-args constructor.\nHowever, care should be taken when relying on this. `Unsafe` is not available in all environments and its usage has some pitfalls,\nsee [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()).\n\n#### Minimum Android API level\n\n- Gson 2.11.0 and newer: API level 21\n- Gson 2.10.1 and older: API level 19\n\nOlder Gson versions may also support lower API levels, however this has not been verified.\n\n### Documentation\n  * [API Javadoc](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson): Documentation for the current release\n  * [User guide](UserGuide.md): This guide contains examples on how to use Gson in your code\n  * [Troubleshooting guide](Troubleshooting.md): Describes how to solve common issues when using Gson\n  * [Releases and change log](https://github.com/google/gson/releases): Latest releases and changes in these versions; for older releases see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)\n  * [Design document](GsonDesignDocument.md): This document discusses issues we faced while designing Gson. It also includes a comparison of Gson with other Java libraries that can be used for Json conversion\n\nPlease use the ['gson' tag on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gson), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/google/gson/discussions) or the [google-gson Google group](https://groups.google.com/group/google-gson) to discuss Gson or to post questions.\n\n### ProGuard / R8\n\nSee the details in the related section in the [Troubleshooting guide](Troubleshooting.md#proguard-r8).\n\n### Related Content Created by Third Parties\n  * [Gson Tutorial](https://www.studytrails.com/java/json/java-google-json-introduction/) by `StudyTrails`\n  * [Gson Tutorial Series](https://futurestud.io/tutorials/gson-getting-started-with-java-json-serialization-deserialization) by `Future Studio`\n  * [Gson API Report](https://abi-laboratory.pro/java/tracker/timeline/gson/)\n\n### Building\n\nGson uses Maven to build the project:\n```\nmvn clean verify\n```\n\nJDK 17 or newer is required for building, JDK 21 is recommended. Newer JDKs are currently not supported for building (but are supported when _using_ Gson).\n\n### Contributing\n\nSee the [contributing guide](https://github.com/google/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\\nPlease perform a quick search to check if there are already existing issues or pull requests related to your contribution.\n\nKeep in mind that Gson is in maintenance mode. If you want to add a new feature, please first search for existing GitHub issues, or create a new one to discuss the feature and get feedback.\n\n### License\n\nGson is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).\n\n```\nCopyright 2008 Google Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis is not an officially supported Google product.\n",

By\nmaking robust banking technology openly available, it lowers barriers for\ninstitutions and innovators to reach underserved and unbanked populations.\n\nHave a look at the [documentation](https://fineract.apache.org/docs/current), the [wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT) or at the [FAQ](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91554327), if this README does not answer what you are looking for.\n\n\nCOMMUNITY\n=========\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this project, but perhaps don't quite know how and where to get started, please [join our developer mailing list](http://fineract.apache.org/#contribute), listen into our conversations, chime into threads, or just send us a \"Hello!\" introduction email; we're a friendly bunch, and look forward to hearing from you. A more informal alternative is the [Fineract Slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T0F5GHE8Y/C028634A61L) (thank you, Mifos, for supporting the Slack channel!).\n\nFor the developer wiki, see [Contributor's Zone](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Contributor%27s+Zone). Maybe [these how-to articles](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/How-to+articles) help you to get started.\n\nIn any case visit [our JIRA Dashboard](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12335824) to find issues to work on, see what others are doing, or open new issues.\n\nIn the moment you get started writing code, please consult our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines, where you will find more information on subjects like coding style, testing and pull requests.\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n============\n* min. 16GB RAM and 8 core CPU\n* `MariaDB >= 11.5.2` or `PostgreSQL >= 17.0`\n* `Java >= 21` (Azul Zulu JVM is tested by our CI on GitHub Actions)\n\nTomcat (min. v10) is only required, if you wish to deploy the Fineract WAR to a separate external servlet container.  You do not need to install Tomcat to run Fineract. We recommend the use of the self-contained JAR, which transparently embeds a servlet container using Spring Boot.\n\n\nSECURITY\n============\nFor a list of known vulnerabilities, see [Apache Fineract Security Reports](https://fineract.apache.org/security.html).\n\nIf you believe you have found a new vulnerability, [let us know privately](https://fineract.apache.org/#contribute).\n\nFor details about security during development and deployment, see the documentation [here](https://fineract.apache.org/docs/current/#_security).\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n============\n\nThe following how-to's assume you have Java installed, you cloned the repository (or downloaded and extracted a [specific version](https://github.com/apache/fineract/releases)) and you have a [database server](#database-and-tables) (MariaDB or PostgreSQL) running.\n\nHow to run for local development\n---\n\nRun the following commands in this order:\n```bash\n./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_tenants\n./gradlew createDB -PdbName=fineract_default\n./gradlew devRun\n```\n\nThis creates two databases and builds and runs Fineract, which will be listening for API requests on port 8443 (by default) now.\n\nConfirm Fineract is ready with, for example:\n\n```bash\ncurl --insecure https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/actuator/health\n```\n\nTo test authenticated endpoints, include credentials in your request:\n\n```bash\ncurl --location \\\n  https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/api/v1/clients \\\n  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  --header 'Fineract-Platform-TenantId: default' \\\n  --header 'Authorization: Basic bWlmb3M6cGFzc3dvcmQ='\n```\n\nHow to run for production\n---\nRunning Fineract to try it out is relatively easy. If you intend to use it in a production environment, be aware that a proper deployment can be complex, costly, and time-consuming. Considerations include: Security, privacy, compliance, performance, service availability, backups, and more. The Fineract project does not provide a comprehensive guide for deploying Fineract in production. You might need skills in enterprise Java applications and more. Alternatively, you could pay a vendor for Fineract deployment and maintenance. You will find tips and tricks for deploying and securing Fineract in our official documentation and in the community-maintained wiki.\n\n\nHow to build the JAR file\n---\nBuild a modern, cloud native, fully self contained JAR file:\n```bash\n./gradlew clean bootJar\n```\nThe JAR will be created in the `fineract-provider/build/libs` directory.\nAs we are not allowed to include a JDBC driver in the built JAR, download a JDBC driver of your choice. For example:\n```bash\nwget https://dlm.mariadb.com/4174416/Connectors/java/connector-java-3.5.2/mariadb-java-client-3.5.2.jar\n```\nStart the JAR and specify the directory containing the JDBC driver using the loader.path option, for example:\n```bash\njava -Dloader.path=. -jar fineract-provider/build/libs/fineract-provider.jar\n```\nThis does not require an external Tomcat.\n\nThe tenants database connection details are configured [via environment variables (as with Docker container)](#instructions-to-run-using-docker-or-podman), e.g. like this:\n```bash\nexport FINERACT_HIKARI_PASSWORD=verysecret\n...\njava -jar fineract-provider.jar\n```\n\nHow to build the WAR file\n---\nBuild a traditional WAR file:\n```bash\n./gradlew :fineract-war:clean :fineract-war:war\n```\nThe WAR will be created in the `fineract-war/build/libs` directory. Afterwards deploy the WAR to your Tomcat Servlet Container.\n\nWe recommend using the JAR instead of the WAR file deployment, because it's much easier.\n\n\nHow to run using Docker or Podman\n---\n\nIt is possible to do a 'one-touch' installation of Fineract using containers (AKA \"Docker\").\nThis includes the database running in the container.\n\nAs prerequisites, you must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your machine; see\n[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\n\nAlternatively, you can also use [Podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod)\n(e.g. via `dnf install podman-docker`), and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/)\n(e.g. via `pip3 install podman-compose`) instead of Docker.\n\nTo run a new Fineract instance on Linux you can simply:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git\ncd fineract\n./gradlew :fineract-provider:jibDockerBuild -x test\n```\nOn Windows, do this instead:\n```cmd\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git --config core.autocrlf=input\ncd fineract\ngradlew :fineract-provider:jibDockerBuild -x test\n```\nInstall the Loki log driver and start:\n```bash\ndocker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest \\\n  --alias loki --grant-all-permissions\ndocker compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up -d\n```\nThe Fineract (back-end) should be running at https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/ now.\nWait for https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/actuator/health to return `{\"status\":\"UP\"}`.\nYou must go to https://localhost:8443 and remember to accept the self-signed SSL certificate of the API once in your browser.\n\n[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/fineract) has a pre-built container image of this project, built continuously.\n\nYou must specify the MySQL tenants database JDBC URL by passing it to the `fineract` container via environment\nvariables; please consult the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) for exact details how to specify those.\n\nThe logfiles and the Java Flight Recorder output are available in `PROJECT_ROOT/build/fineract/logs`. If you use IntelliJ then you can double-click on the `.jfr` file and open it with the IDE. You can also download [Azul Mission Control](https://www.azul.com/products/components/azul-mission-control/) to analyze the Java Flight Recorder file.\n\nNOTE: If you have issues with the file permissions and Docker Compose then you might need to change the variable values for `FINERACT_USER` and `FINERACT_GROUP` in `PROJECT_ROOT/config/docker/env/fineract-common.env`. You can find out what values you need to put there with the following commands:\n\n```bash\nid -u ${USER}\nid -g ${GROUP}\n```\n\nPlease make sure that you are not checking in your changed values. The defaults should work for most people.\n\n\nHow to run on Kubernetes\n---\n\n### General Clusters\n\nYou can also run Fineract using containers on a Kubernetes cluster.\nMake sure you set up and connect to your Kubernetes cluster.\nYou can follow [this](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Install+and+configure+kubectl+and+Google+Cloud+SDK+on+ubuntu+16.04) guide to set up a Kubernetes cluster on GKE. Make sure to replace `apache-fineract-cn` with `apache-fineract`\n\nNow e.g. from your Google Cloud shell, run the following commands:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git\ncd fineract/kubernetes\n./kubectl-startup.sh\n```\n\nTo shutdown and reset your Cluster, run:\n```bash\n./kubectl-shutdown.sh\n```\n\n### Using Minikube\n\nAlternatively, you can run fineract on a local kubernetes cluster using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).\nAs prerequisite you must have `minikube` and `kubectl` installed on your machine; see\n[Minikube & Kubectl install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).\n\nTo run a new Fineract instance on Minikube you can simply:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/fineract.git\ncd fineract/kubernetes\nminikube start\n./kubectl-startup.sh\n```\n\nWait for all pods to be ready:\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -w\n```\n\nOnce all pods are running, access the Mifos web application:\n```bash\nminikube service mifos-community\n```\n\nThis opens the Mifos X web application in your browser. The nginx reverse proxy in the mifos-community pod forwards API requests to the fineract-server backend.\n\n**Default credentials:**\n- Username: `mifos`\n- Password: `password`\n\nYou can also access the Fineract API directly:\n```bash\nminikube service fineract-server --url --https\n```\n\nFineract is now running at the printed URL, which you can check e.g. using:\n```bash\nhttp --verify=no --timeout 240 --check-status get $(minikube service fineract-server --url --https)/fineract-provider/actuator/health\n```\n\nTo check the status of your containers on your local minikube Kubernetes cluster, run:\n```bash\nminikube dashboard\n```\n\nYou can check Fineract logs using:\n```bash\nkubectl logs deployment/fineract-server\n```\n\nYou can check Mifos web app logs using:\n```bash\nkubectl logs deployment/mifos-community\n```\n\nTo shutdown and reset your cluster, run:\n```bash\n./kubectl-shutdown.sh\n```\n\n\nHow to enable External Message Broker (ActiveMQ or Apache Kafka)\n---\n\nThere are two use-cases where external message broker is needed:\n - External Business Events / Reliable Event Framework\n - Executing Partitioned Spring Batch Jobs\n\nExternal Events are business events, e.g.: `ClientCreated`, which might be important for third party systems. Apache Fineract supports ActiveMQ (or other JMS compliant brokers) and Apache Kafka endpoints for sending out Business Events. By default, they are not emitted.\n\nIn case of a large deployment with millions of accounts, the Close of Business Day Spring Batch job may run several hours. In order to speed up this task, remote partitioning of the job is supported. The Manager node partitions breaks up the COB job into smaller pieces (sub tasks), which then can be executed on multiple Worker nodes in parallel. The worker nodes are notified either by ActiveMQ or Kafka regarding their new sub tasks.\n\n### ActiveMQ\n\nJMS based messaging is disabled by default. In `docker-compose-postgresql-activemq.yml` an example is shown, where ActiveMQ is enabled. In that configuration one Spring Batch Manager instance and two Spring Batch Worker instances are created.\nSpring based events should be disabled and jms based event handling should be enabled. Furthermore, proper broker JMS URL should be configured.\n\n```\n      FINERACT_REMOTE_JOB_MESSAGE_HANDLER_JMS_ENABLED=true\n      FINERACT_REMOTE_JOB_MESSAGE_HANDLER_SPRING_EVENTS_ENABLED=false\n      FINERACT_REMOTE_JOB_MESSAGE_HANDLER_JMS_BROKER_URL=tcp://activemq:61616\n```\n\nFor additional ActiveMQ related configuration please take a look to the `application.properties` where the supported configuration parameters are listed with their default values.\n\n### Kafka\n\nKafka support is also disabled by default. In `docker-compose-postgresql-kafka.yml` an example is shown, where self-hosted Kafka is enabled for both External Events and Spring Batch Remote Job execution.\n\nDuring the development Fineract was tested with PLAINTEXT Kafka brokers without authentication and with AWS MSK using IAM authentication. The extra [JAR file](https://github.com/aws/aws-msk-iam-auth/releases) required for IAM authentication is already added to the classpath.\nAn example MSK setup can be found in `docker-compose-postgresql-kafka-msk.yml`.\n\nThe full list of supported Kafka related properties is documented in the [Fineract Platform documentation](https://fineract.apache.org/docs/current/).\n\n\nDATABASE AND TABLES\n===================\n\nYou can run the required version of the database server in a container, instead of having to install it, like this:\n\n    docker run --name mariadb-11.5 -p 3306:3306 -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql -d mariadb:11.5.2\n\nand stop and destroy it like this:\n\n    docker rm -f mariadb-11.5\n\nBeware that this container database keeps its state inside the container and not on the host filesystem.  It is lost when you destroy (rm) this container.  This is typically fine for development.  See [Caveats: Where to Store Data on the database container documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) regarding how to make it persistent instead of ephemeral.\n\n\nMySQL/MariaDB and UTC timezone\n---\nWith release `1.8.0` we introduced improved date time handling in Fineract. Date time is stored in UTC, and UTC timezone enforced even on the JDBC driver, e. g. for MySQL:\n\n```\nserverTimezone=UTC&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&sessionVariables=time_zone='-00:00'\n```\n\nIf you use MySQL as Fineract database, the following configuration is highly recommended:\n\n* Run the application in UTC (the default command line in our Docker image has the necessary parameters already set)\n* Run the MySQL database server in UTC (if you use managed services like AWS RDS, then this should be the default anyway, but it would be good to double-check)\n\nIn case Fineract and MySQL do not run in UTC, MySQL might save date time values differently from PostgreSQL\n\nExample scenario: If the Fineract instance runs in timezone: GMT+2, and the local date time is 2022-08-11 17:15 ...\n* ... then PostgreSQL saves the LocalDateTime as is: 2022-08-11 17:15\n* ... and MySQL saves the LocalDateTime in UTC: 2022-08-11 15:15\n* ... but when we read the date time from PostgreSQL or from MySQL, both systems give us the same value: 2022-08-11 17:15 GMT+2\n\nIf a previously used Fineract instance didn't run in UTC (backward compatibility), all prior dates will be read wrongly by MySQL. This can cause issues, when you run the database migration scripts.\n\nRecommendation: Shift all dates in your database by the timezone offset that your Fineract instance used.\n\n\nCONNECTION POOL CONFIGURATION\n=======\n\nPlease check `application.properties` to see which connection pool settings can be tweaked. The associated environment variables are prefixed with `FINERACT_HIKARI_*`. You can find more information about specific connection pool settings at the [HikariCP Github repository](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP?tab=readme-ov-file#gear-configuration-knobs-baby).\n\nNOTE: We keep backwards compatibility until one of the next releases to ensure that things are working as expected. Environment variables prefixed `fineract_tenants_*` can still be used to configure the database connection, but we strongly encourage using `FINERACT_HIKARI_*` with more options.\n\n\nVERSIONS\n============\n\nA release version is derived from source control. The version will include `-SNAPSHOT` unless the current branch looks like a release or release maintenance branch. See `gitVersioning` settings in `build.gradle` for details.\n\nThe latest stable release can be viewed on the develop branch: [Latest Release on Develop](https://github.com/apache/fineract/tree/develop \"Latest Release\").\n\nThe progress of this project can be viewed in the left hand navigation under [this page of the wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Fineract+Releases)\n\n\nLICENSE\n============\n\nThis project is licensed under [Apache License Version 2.0](https://github.com/apache/fineract/blob/develop/APACHE_LICENSETEXT.md).\n\nThe Connector/J JDBC Driver client library from [MariaDB](https://www.mariadb.org) is licensed under the LGPL.\nThe library is often used in development when running integration tests that use the Liquibase library. That JDBC\ndriver is however not distributed with the Fineract product and is not required to use the product.\nIf you are a developer and object to using the LGPL licensed Connector/J JDBC driver,\nsimply do not run the integration tests that use the Liquibase library and use another JDBC driver.\nAs discussed in [LEGAL-462](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-462), this project therefore\ncomplies with the [Apache Software Foundation third-party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).\n\n\nPLATFORM API\n============\n\nFineract does not provide a UI, but provides an API. Running Fineract locally, the Swagger documentation can be accessed under `https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/swagger-ui/index.html`. A live version can be accessed via [this Sandbox](https://sandbox.mifos.community/fineract-provider/swagger-ui/index.html) (not hosted by us).\n\nApache Fineract supports client code generation using [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) based on the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). For more instructions on how to generate client code, check [this section](https://fineract.apache.org/docs/current/#_generate_api_client) of the Fineract documentation. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlVd-0YAo6c) documents the use of the Swagger-UI.\n",

API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api),  [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu/files) |\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload and install the [fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/)\n \nDownload the latest [release or pre-release](https://github.com/19MisterX98/SeedCrackerX/releases) of SeedCrackerX\n  \nput the .jar file in your mod directory, either %appdata%/.minecraft/mods/ folder for the vanilla launcher or your own instance folder.\n  \n#### Optional\n  \nDownload the latest release of [Multiconnect](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/multiconnect/releases) or [ViaFabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabric) to connect to servers on lower MC versions\n  \n## Database\n\nSince the mod is used by many people, I have decided to create a Google sheet for server seeds.\nIf you enable the database option in the config gui the mod will send cracked seeds from 10+ player servers directly to the Google sheet.\nYou also need a minecraft license\n\n[The Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tuQiE-0leW88em9OHbZnH-RFNhVqgoHhIt9WQbeqqWw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Usage\n\n## 1.17.X and below\n\n### Overworld\n\nRun around in the world until the mod finds a dungeon. After the mod found one the cracking process starts automatically.\nIf it doesn't give you a world seed, you may need to find another dungeon.\n\n### The Nether\n\nRun around in the warped fungus biome until the mod finds big fungus and starts cracking.\n\n### The End\n\nYou have to find 5 (or more) end cities or end gateways and then return to the center of the end dimension to obtain the pillar seed, after that cracking should begin.\n\n#### Video guides:\n- [Structures and Endpillars](https://youtu.be/aUuPSZVPH8E?t=462)\n- [warped fungus](https://youtu.be/HKjwgofhKs4)\n\n  ### Supported Decorators\n    - Dungeon\n    - End Gateway\n    - Desert Well\n    - Emerald Ore\n    - Warped Fungus\n\n## 1.18.X and higher\n\nDungeon cracking, fungus cracking don't work anymore.\n\n### Overworld\n\nGo to the config menu via \"/seedcracker gui\" (1.19.3+) or \"/seed gui\" (before 1.19.3) and make sure that Emeralds, Gateways, Biomes, Desert wells and Warped fungi are disabled since they aren't updated and can give wrong data.\n\nFor cracking, you now need to get 40 bits of liftable structures and 32 regular bits from the listed ones:\n\n  ### Supported Structures\n  \n    - Igloo - 9 regular and liftable bits\n    - Desert Pyramid - 9 regular and liftable bits\n    - Jungle Temple - 9 regular and liftable bits\n    - Swamp Hut - 9 regular and liftable bits\n    - Shipwreck - 8 regular and liftable bits\n    - Pillager Outpost - 9 liftable bits\n    - Ocean Monument - 9 regular bits\n\nAny combination is valid. For example: 3 shipwrecks, 1 pyramid and 1 igloo.\nYou can track your process with \"/seed data bits\" (look at the bits count for liftable structures)\nA structure is found when there is an outline around it.\nAfter you get enough, the cracking process starts automatically. This process takes around 1-5 mins.\nThe mod may ask you to find additional structures after this.\nIt's more likely to happen with fewer bits and structures of the same type.\nAfter reducing your structure seeds, the mod will brute force your world seed via dungeon positions or hashed seed.\n\n### The Nether\n\nFungus cracking don't work anymore, so there are no way to find nether seed using SeedcrackerX, however you can try to crack it yourself by using [Nether_Bedrock_Cracker](https://github.com/19MisterX98/Nether_Bedrock_Cracker)\n    \n### The End\n\nYou have to find 5 (or more) end cities (fill up regular bits) and then return to the center of the end dimension to obtain the pillar seed, after that cracking should begin.\n\n- You need to disable end gateways!\n\n## Commands\n\nIf version of your mod is older than 2.13.1, use prefix\n - `/seed` instead of `/seedcracker`\n\n  ### GUI Command\n  - `/seedcracker gui`\n  \n  Opens the config gui where you can modify settings like the server mc-version, all finders, database and rendermode.\n  There are command alternatives for most of this, but they shouldn't be used anymore.\n  \n  ### Finder Reload Command\n  - `/seedcracker finder reload`\n\n  Rescans the loaded Chunks to find structures that weren't found before.\n\n  ### Data Command\n  - `/seedcracker data clear`\n  \n  Clears all the collected data without requiring a relog. This is useful for multi-world servers.\n  \n  - `/seedcracker data bits`\n  \n  Display how many bits of information have been collected.\n  Normal bits are used for end pillar + structure cracking. Cracking starts at 32 bits.\n  Lifting bits are used for liftable structure cracking. Cracking starts at 40 bits.\n  \n  - `/seed data restore`\n  \n  When you leave a world, the mod will save currently collected structure information in a file of the .minecraft/config directory.\n  After rejoining, you can restore it with this command.\n  \n  \n  ### Debug Command\n  - `/seedcracker cracker debug`\n\n  Additional info is shown\n  \n  ### Database Command\n  - `/seedcracker database`\n  \n  Opens a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tuQiE-0leW88em9OHbZnH-RFNhVqgoHhIt9WQbeqqWw/edit?usp=sharing) that is maintained by the mod\n  \n## Video Tutorials\n\nNeil's:\n- [1.15](https://youtu.be/1ChmLi9og8Q)\n- [1.16](https://youtu.be/aUuPSZVPH8E)\n\nDyiing's\n- [1.18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKeEyx7jIE4)\n\nMine:\n- [Dungeon cracking & end pillar cracking](https://youtu.be/8ytfZ2MXosY)\n- [Nether cracking](https://youtu.be/HKjwgofhKs4)\n- [Structure cracking](https://youtu.be/UXVrBaOR8H0)\n\n\n## Setting up the Workspace\n\n-Clone the repository.\n\n-Run `gradlew genSources <idea|eclipse>`.\n\n## Building the Mod\n\n-Update the version in `build.gradle` and `fabric.mod.json`.\n\n-Run `gradlew build`.\n\n## API for other mods\n\n- Include seedcracker-api and jitpack in your build.gradle\n\n      repositories {\n          mavenCentral()\n          maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\n      }\n      \n      dependencies {\n          implementation (include('com.github.19MisterX98.SeedcrackerX:seedcrackerx-api:master-SNAPSHOT')) {transitive = false}\n      }\n\n- Add a class that implements the api interface\n\n      package misterx.myMod.seedManagemnet.SeedCrackerEP\n      \n      import kaptainwutax.seedcrackerX.api.SeedCrackerAPI;\n    \n      public class SeedCrackerEP implements SeedCrackerAPI {\n          @Override\n          public void pushWorldSeed(long seed) {\n              //do something\n              Foo.bar(seed)\n          }\n      }\n\n- Tell fabric.mod.json where your entrypoint is\n\n      \"entrypoints\": {\n        \"main\": [...],\n        \"client\": [...],\n        \"server\": [...],\n        \"seedcrackerx\": [\n          \"misterx.myMod.seedManagemnet.SeedCrackerEP\"\n        ]\n      },\n\n## Contributors\n\n[KaptainWutax](https://github.com/KaptainWutax) - Author of the original mod\n\n[neil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUuPSZVPH8E) - Video Tutorials\n\n[Nekzuris](https://github.com/Nekzuris) and [ItzSkyReed](https://github.com/ItzSkyReed)  - README\n\n[19MisterX98](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCby9ZxEjJCqmccQGF3GSYlA) - Author of SeedCrackerX\n",

Servers spend a *lot* of time parsing it. We need a fresh\napproach. The simdjson library uses commonly available SIMD instructions and microparallel algorithms\nto parse JSON 4x  faster than RapidJSON and 25x faster than JSON for Modern C++.\n\n* **Fast:** Over 4x faster than commonly used production-grade JSON parsers.\n* **Record Breaking Features:** Minify JSON  at 6 GB/s, validate UTF-8  at 13 GB/s,  NDJSON at 3.5 GB/s.\n* **Easy:** First-class, easy to use and carefully documented APIs.\n* **Strict:** Full JSON and UTF-8 validation, lossless parsing. Performance with no compromises.\n* **Automatic:** Selects a CPU-tailored parser at runtime. No configuration needed.\n* **Reliable:** From memory allocation to error handling, simdjson's design avoids surprises.\n* **Peer Reviewed:** Our research appears in venues like VLDB Journal, Software: Practice and Experience.\n\nThis library is part of the [Awesome Modern C++](https://awesomecpp.com) list.\n\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n\n* [Real-world usage](#real-world-usage)\n* [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n* [Documentation](#documentation)\n* [Godbolt](#godbolt)\n* [Performance results](#performance-results)\n* [Packages](#packages)\n* [Bindings and Ports of simdjson](#bindings-and-ports-of-simdjson)\n* [About simdjson](#about-simdjson)\n* [Funding](#funding)\n* [Contributing to simdjson](#contributing-to-simdjson)\n* [License](#license)\n\n\nReal-world usage\n----------------\n\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)\n- [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse)\n- [Meta Velox](https://velox-lib.io)\n- [Google Pax](https://github.com/google/paxml)\n- [milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus)\n- [QuestDB](https://questdb.io/blog/questdb-release-8-0-3/)\n- [Clang Build Analyzer](https://github.com/aras-p/ClangBuildAnalyzer)\n- [Shopify HeapProfiler](https://github.com/Shopify/heap-profiler)\n- [StarRocks](https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks)\n- [Microsoft FishStore](https://github.com/microsoft/FishStore)\n- [Intel PCM](https://github.com/intel/pcm)\n- [WatermelonDB](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB)\n- [Apache Doris](https://github.com/apache/doris)\n- [Dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph)\n- [UJRPC](https://github.com/unum-cloud/ujrpc)\n- [fastgltf](https://github.com/spnda/fastgltf)\n- [vast](https://github.com/tenzir/vast)\n- [ada-url](https://github.com/ada-url/ada)\n- [fastgron](https://github.com/adamritter/fastgron)\n- [WasmEdge](https://wasmedge.org)\n- [RonDB](https://github.com/logicalclocks/rondb)\n- [GreptimeDB](https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/greptimedb)\n- [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)\n\n\nIf you are planning to use simdjson in a product, please work from one of our releases.\n\n\n\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nThe simdjson library is easily consumable with a single .h and .cpp file.\n\n0. Prerequisites: `g++` (version 7 or better) or `clang++` (version 6 or better), and a 64-bit\n   system with a command-line shell (e.g., Linux, macOS, freeBSD). We also support programming\n   environments like Visual Studio and Xcode, but different steps are needed. Users of clang++ may need to specify the C++ version (e.g., `c++ -std=c++17`) since clang++ tends to default on C++98.\n1. Pull [simdjson.h](singleheader/simdjson.h) and [simdjson.cpp](singleheader/simdjson.cpp) into a\n   directory, along with the sample file [twitter.json](jsonexamples/twitter.json). You can download them with the `wget` utility:\n\n   ```\n   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simdjson/simdjson/master/singleheader/simdjson.h https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simdjson/simdjson/master/singleheader/simdjson.cpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simdjson/simdjson/master/jsonexamples/twitter.json\n   ```\n2. Create `quickstart.cpp`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"simdjson.h\"\nusing namespace simdjson;\nint main(void) {\n    ondemand::parser parser;\n    padded_string json = padded_string::load(\"twitter.json\");\n    ondemand::document tweets = parser.iterate(json);\n    std::cout << uint64_t(tweets[\"search_metadata\"][\"count\"]) << \" results.\" << std::endl;\n}\n```\n3. `c++ -o quickstart quickstart.cpp simdjson.cpp`\n4. `./quickstart`\n\n  ```\n   100 results.\n  ```\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nUsage documentation is available:\n\n* [Basics](doc/basics.md) is an overview of how to use simdjson and its APIs.\n* [Builder](doc/builder.md) is an overview of how to efficiently write JSON strings using simdjson.\n* [Performance](doc/performance.md) shows some more advanced scenarios and how to tune for them.\n* [Implementation Selection](doc/implementation-selection.md) describes runtime CPU detection and\n  how you can work with it.\n* [API](https://simdjson.github.io/simdjson/) contains the automatically generated API documentation.\n* [Compile-Time Parsing](doc/compile_time.md) presents our compile-time parsing function (C++26 only).\n\n\nGodbolt\n-------------\n\nSome users may want to browse code along with the compiled assembly. You want to check out the following lists of examples:\n* [C++26 reflection example](https://godbolt.org/z/K3Px64TqK)\n* [simdjson examples with errors handled through exceptions](https://godbolt.org/z/7G5qE4sr9)\n* [simdjson examples with errors without exceptions](https://godbolt.org/z/e9dWb9E4v)\n\nPerformance results\n-------------------\n\nThe simdjson library uses three-quarters less instructions than state-of-the-art parser [RapidJSON](https://rapidjson.org). To our knowledge, simdjson is the first fully-validating JSON parser\nto run at [gigabytes per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte) (GB/s) on commodity processors. It can parse millions of JSON documents per second on a single core.\n\nThe following figure represents parsing speed in GB/s for parsing various files\non an Intel Skylake processor (3.4 GHz) using the GNU GCC 10 compiler (with the -O3 flag).\nWe compare against the best and fastest C++ libraries on benchmarks that load and process the data.\nThe simdjson library offers full unicode ([UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)) validation and exact\nnumber parsing.\n\n<img src=\"doc/rome.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\nThe simdjson library offers high speed whether it processes tiny files (e.g., 300 bytes)\nor larger files (e.g., 3MB). The following plot presents parsing\nspeed for [synthetic files over various sizes generated with a script](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson_experiments_vldb2019/blob/master/experiments/growing/gen.py) on a 3.4 GHz Skylake processor (GNU GCC 9, -O3).\n\n<img src=\"doc/growing.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\n[All our experiments are reproducible](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson_experiments_vldb2019).\n\n\nFor NDJSON files, we can exceed 3 GB/s with [our  multithreaded parsing functions](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson/blob/master/doc/parse_many.md).\n\n\nPackages\n------------------------------\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/simdjson.svg)](https://repology.org/project/simdjson/versions)\n\n\nBindings and Ports of simdjson\n------------------------------\n\nWe distinguish between \"bindings\" (which just wrap the C++ code) and a port to another programming language (which reimplements everything).\n\n- [ZippyJSON](https://github.com/michaeleisel/zippyjson): Swift bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [libpy_simdjson](https://github.com/gerrymanoim/libpy_simdjson/): high-speed Python bindings for simdjson using [libpy](https://github.com/quantopian/libpy).\n- [pysimdjson](https://github.com/TkTech/pysimdjson): Python bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [cysimdjson](https://github.com/TeskaLabs/cysimdjson): high-speed Python bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [simdjson-rs](https://github.com/simd-lite): Rust port.\n- [simdjson-rust](https://github.com/SunDoge/simdjson-rust): Rust wrapper (bindings).\n- [SimdJsonSharp](https://github.com/EgorBo/SimdJsonSharp): C# version for .NET Core (bindings and full port).\n- [simdjson_nodejs](https://github.com/luizperes/simdjson_nodejs): Node.js bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [simdjson_php](https://github.com/crazyxman/simdjson_php): PHP bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [simdjson_ruby](https://github.com/saka1/simdjson_ruby): Ruby bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [fast_jsonparser](https://github.com/anilmaurya/fast_jsonparser): Ruby bindings for the simdjson project.\n- [simdjson-go](https://github.com/minio/simdjson-go): Go port using Golang assembly.\n- [rcppsimdjson](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rcppsimdjson): R bindings.\n- [simdjson_erlang](https://github.com/ChomperT/simdjson_erlang): erlang bindings.\n- [simdjsone](https://github.com/saleyn/simdjsone): erlang bindings.\n- [lua-simdjson](https://github.com/FourierTransformer/lua-simdjson): lua bindings.\n- [hermes-json](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hermes-json): haskell bindings.\n- [zimdjson](https://github.com/EzequielRamis/zimdjson): Zig port.\n- [simdjzon](https://github.com/travisstaloch/simdjzon): Zig port.\n- [JSON-Simd](https://github.com/rawleyfowler/JSON-simd): Raku bindings.\n- [JSON::SIMD](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::SIMD): Perl bindings; fully-featured JSON module that uses simdjson for decoding.\n- [gemmaJSON](https://github.com/sainttttt/gemmaJSON): Nim JSON parser based on simdjson bindings.\n- [simdjson-java](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson-java): Java port.\n\nAbout simdjson\n--------------\n\nThe simdjson library takes advantage of modern microarchitectures, parallelizing with SIMD vector\ninstructions, reducing branch misprediction, and reducing data dependency to take advantage of each\nCPU's multiple execution cores.\n\nOur default front-end is called On-Demand, and we wrote a paper about it:\n\n- John Keiser, Daniel Lemire, [On-Demand JSON: A Better Way to Parse Documents?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17149), Software: Practice and Experience 54 (6), 2024.\n\nSome people [enjoy reading the first (2019) simdjson paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08318): A description of the design\nand implementation of simdjson is in our research article:\n- Geoff Langdale, Daniel Lemire, [Parsing Gigabytes of JSON per Second](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08318), VLDB Journal 28 (6), 2019.\n\nWe have an in-depth paper focused on the UTF-8 validation:\n\n- John Keiser, Daniel Lemire, [Validating UTF-8 In Less Than One Instruction Per Byte](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03090), Software: Practice & Experience 51 (5), 2021.\n\nWe also have an informal [blog post providing some background and context](https://branchfree.org/2019/02/25/paper-parsing-gigabytes-of-json-per-second/).\n\nFor the video inclined, <br />\n[![simdjson at QCon San Francisco 2019](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wlvKAT7SZIQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlvKAT7SZIQ)<br />\n(It was the best voted talk, we're kinda proud of it.)\n\nCiting this work\n-----------------\n\nIf you use simdjson in published research, please cite the software library.

      "readme": "# MAME\n\n## What is MAME?\n\nMAME is a multi-purpose emulation framework.\n\nMAME's purpose is to preserve decades of software history. As electronic technology continues to rush forward, MAME prevents this important \"vintage\" software from being lost and forgotten. This is achieved by documenting the hardware and how it functions. The source code to MAME serves as this documentation. The fact that the software is usable serves primarily to validate the accuracy of the documentation (how else can you prove that you have recreated the hardware faithfully?). Over time, MAME (originally stood for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) absorbed the sister-project MESS (Multi Emulator Super System), so MAME now documents a wide variety of (mostly vintage) computers, video game consoles and calculators, in addition to the arcade video games that were its initial focus.\n\n## Where can I find out more?\n\n* [Official MAME Development Team Site](https://www.mamedev.org/) (includes binary downloads, wiki, forums, and more)\n* [MAME Testers](https://mametesters.org/) (official bug tracker for MAME)\n\n### Community\n\n* [MAME Forums on bannister.org](https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=cfrm&c=5)\n* [r/MAME](https://www.reddit.com/r/MAME/) on Reddit\n* [MAMEWorld Forums](https://www.mameworld.info/ubbthreads/)\n\n## Development\n\n![Alt](https://repobeats.axiom.co/api/embed/8461d8ae4630322dafc736fc25782de214b49630.svg \"Repobeats analytics image\")\n\n### CI status and code scanning\n\n[![CI (Linux)](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/workflows/CI%20(Linux)/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/actions/workflows/ci-linux.yml) [![CI (Windows](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/workflows/CI%20(Windows)/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/actions/workflows/ci-windows.yml) [![CI (macOS)](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/workflows/CI%20(macOS)/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/actions/workflows/ci-macos.yml) [![Compile UI translations](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/workflows/Compile%20UI%20translations/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/actions/workflows/language.yml) [![Build documentation](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/workflows/Build%20documentation/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/actions/workflows/docs.yml)  [![Coverity Scan Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/5727/badge.svg?flat=1)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/mame-emulator)\n\n### How to compile?\n\nIf you're on a UNIX-like system (including Linux and macOS), it could be as easy as typing\n\n```\nmake\n```\n\nfor a full build,\n\n```\nmake SUBTARGET=tiny\n```\n\nfor a build including a small subset of supported systems.\n\nSee the [Compiling MAME](http://docs.mamedev.org/initialsetup/compilingmame.html) page on our documentation site for more information, including prerequisites for macOS and popular Linux distributions.\n\nFor recent versions of macOS you need to install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) including command-line tools and [SDL 2.0](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/latest).\n\nFor Windows users, we provide a ready-made [build environment](http://www.mamedev.org/tools/) based on MinGW-w64.\n\nVisual Studio builds are also possible, but you still need [build environment](http://www.mamedev.org/tools/) based on MinGW-w64.\nIn order to generate solution and project files just run:\n\n```\nmake vs2022\n```\nor use this command to build it directly using msbuild\n\n```\nmake vs2022 MSBUILD=1\n```\n\n### Coding standard\n\nMAME source code should be viewed and edited with your editor set to use four spaces per tab. Tabs are used for initial indentation of lines, with one tab used per indentation level. Spaces are used for other alignment within a line.\n\nSome parts of the code follow [Allman style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style); some parts of the code follow [K&R style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R_style) -- mostly depending on who wrote the original version. **Above all else, be consistent with what you modify, and keep whitespace changes to a minimum when modifying existing source.** For new code, the majority tends to prefer Allman style, so if you don't care much, use that.\n\nAll contributors need to either add a standard header for license info (on new files) or inform us of their wishes regarding which of the following licenses they would like their code to be made available under: the [BSD-3-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license, the [LGPL-2.1](http://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1), or the [GPL-2.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0).\n\nSee more specific [C++ Coding Guidelines](https://docs.mamedev.org/contributing/cxx.html) on our documentation web site.\n\n## License\n\nThe MAME project as a whole is made available under the terms of the\n[GNU General Public License, version 2](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0)\nor later (GPL-2.0+), since it contains code made available under multiple\nGPL-compatible licenses.

The library\ncodebase serves as an interface to ModSecurity Connectors taking in web traffic\nand applying traditional ModSecurity processing. In general, it provides the\ncapability to load/interpret rules written in the ModSecurity SecRules format\nand apply them to HTTP content provided by your application via Connectors.\n\nIf you are looking for ModSecurity for Apache (aka ModSecurity v2.x), it is still under maintenance and available:\n[here](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/tree/v2/master).\n\n### What is the difference between this project and the old ModSecurity (v2.x.x)?\n\n* All Apache dependencies have been removed\n* Higher performance\n* New features\n* New architecture\n\nLibmodsecurity is a complete rewrite of the ModSecurity platform. When it was first devised the ModSecurity project started as just an Apache module. Over time the project has been extended, due to popular demand, to support other platforms including (but not limited to) Nginx and IIS. In order to provide for the growing demand for additional platform support, it has became necessary to remove the Apache dependencies underlying this project, making it more platform independent.\n\nAs a result of this goal we have rearchitected Libmodsecurity such that it is no longer dependent on the Apache web server (both at compilation and during runtime). One side effect of this is that across all platforms users can expect increased performance. Additionally, we have taken this opportunity to lay the groundwork for some new features that users have been long seeking. For example we are looking to natively support auditlogs in the JSON format, along with a host of other functionality in future versions.\n\n\n### It is no longer just a module.\n\nThe 'ModSecurity' branch no longer contains the traditional module logic (for Nginx, Apache, and IIS) that has traditionally been packaged all together. Instead, this branch only contains the library portion (libmodsecurity) for this project. This library is consumed by what we have termed 'Connectors' these connectors will interface with your webserver and provide the library with a common format that it understands. Each of these connectors is maintained as a separate GitHub project. For instance, the Nginx connector is supplied by the ModSecurity-nginx project (https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity-nginx).\n\nKeeping these connectors separated allows each project to have different release cycles, issues and development trees. Additionally, it means that when you install ModSecurity v3 you only get exactly what you need, no extras you won't be using.\n\n# Compilation\n\nBefore starting the compilation process, make sure that you have all the\ndependencies in place. Read the subsection “Dependencies”  for further\ninformation.\n\nAfter the compilation make sure that there are no issues on your\nbuild/platform. We strongly recommend the utilization of the unit tests and\nregression tests. These test utilities are located under the subfolder ‘tests’.\n\nAs a dynamic library, don’t forget that libmodsecurity must be installed to a location (folder) where you OS will be looking for dynamic libraries.\n\n\n\n### Unix (Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, …)\n\nOn unix the project uses autotools to help the compilation process. Please note that if you are working with `git`, don't forget to initialize and update the submodules. Here's a quick how-to:\n```shell\n$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity ModSecurity\n$ cd ModSecurity\n```\n\nYou can then start the build process:\n\n```shell\n$ ./build.sh\n$ ./configure\n$ make\n$ sudo make install\n```\n\nDetails on distribution specific builds can be found in our Wiki:\n[Compilation Recipes](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity/wiki/Compilation-recipes)\n\n### Windows\n\nWindows build information can be found [here](build/win32/README.md).\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis library is written in C++ using the C++17 standards. It also uses Flex\nand Yacc to produce the “Sec Rules Language” parser. Other, mandatory dependencies include YAJL, as ModSecurity uses JSON for producing logs and its testing framework, libpcre (not yet mandatory) for processing regular expressions in SecRules, and libXML2 (not yet mandatory) which is used for parsing XML requests.\n\nAll others dependencies are related to operators specified within SecRules or configuration directives and may not be required for compilation. A short list of such dependencies is as follows:\n\n* libinjection is needed for the operator @detectXSS and @detectSQL\n* curl is needed for the directive SecRemoteRules.\n\nIf those libraries are missing ModSecurity will be compiled without the support for the operator @detectXSS and the configuration directive SecRemoteRules.\n\n# Library documentation\n\nThe library documentation is written within the code in Doxygen format. To generate this documentation, please use the doxygen utility with the provided configuration file, “doxygen.cfg”, located with the \"doc/\" subfolder. This will generate HTML formatted documentation including usage examples.\n\n# Library utilization\n\nThe library provides a C++ and C interface. Some resources are currently only\navailable via the C++ interface, for instance, the capability to create custom logging\nmechanism (see the regression test to check for how those logging mechanism works).\nThe objective is to have both APIs (C, C++) providing the same functionality,\nif you find an aspect of the API that is missing via a particular interface, please open an issue.\n\nInside the subfolder examples, there are simple examples on how to use the API.\nBelow some are illustrated:\n\n###  Simple example using C++\n\n```c++\nusing ModSecurity::ModSecurity;\nusing ModSecurity::Rules;\nusing ModSecurity::Transaction;\n\nModSecurity *modsec;\nModSecurity::Rules *rules;\n\nmodsec = new ModSecurity();\n\nrules = new Rules();\n\nrules->loadFromUri(rules_file);\n\nTransaction *modsecTransaction = new Transaction(modsec, rules);\n\nmodsecTransaction->processConnection(\"127.0.0.1\");\nif (modsecTransaction->intervention()) {\n   std::cout << \"There is an intervention\" << std::endl;\n}\n```\n\n### Simple example using C\n\n```c\n#include \"modsecurity/modsecurity.h\"\n#include \"modsecurity/transaction.h\"\n\n\nchar main_rule_uri[] = \"basic_rules.conf\";\n\nint main (int argc, char **argv)\n{\n    ModSecurity *modsec = NULL;\n    Transaction *transaction = NULL;\n    Rules *rules = NULL;\n\n    modsec = msc_init();\n\n    rules = msc_create_rules_set();\n    msc_rules_add_file(rules, main_rule_uri);\n\n    transaction = msc_new_transaction(modsec, rules);\n\n    msc_process_connection(transaction, \"127.0.0.1\");\n    msc_process_uri(transaction, \"http://www.modsecurity.org/test?key1=value1&key2=value2&key3=value3&test=args&test=test\");\n    msc_process_request_headers(transaction);\n    msc_process_request_body(transaction);\n    msc_process_response_headers(transaction);\n    msc_process_response_body(transaction);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\n\n# Contributing\n\nYou are more than welcome to contribute to this project and look forward to growing the community around this new version of ModSecurity. Areas of interest include: New\nfunctionalities, fixes, bug report, support for beginning users, or anything that you\nare willing to help with.\n\n## Providing patches\n\nWe prefer to have your patch within the GitHub infrastructure to facilitate our\nreview work, and our Q.A. integration. GitHub provides excellent\ndocumentation on how to perform “Pull Requests”, more information available\nhere: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/\n\nPlease respect the coding style. Pull requests can include various commits, so\nprovide one fix or one piece of functionality per commit. Please do not change anything outside\nthe scope of your target work (e.g. coding style in a function that you have\npassed by). For further information about the coding style used in this\nproject, please check: https://www.chromium.org/blink/coding-style\n\nProvides explanative commit messages. Your first line should  give the highlights of your\npatch, 3rd and on give a more detailed explanation/technical details about your\npatch. Patch explanation is valuable during the review process.\n\n### Don’t know where to start?\n\nWithin our code there are various items marked as TODO or FIXME that may need\nyour attention. Check the list of items by performing a grep:\n\n```\n$ cd /path/to/modsecurity-nginx\n$ egrep -Rin \"TODO|FIXME\" -R *\n```\n\nA TODO list is also available as part of the Doxygen documentation.\n\n### Testing your patch\n\nAlong with the manual testing, we strongly recommend you to use the our\nregression tests and unit tests. If you have implemented an operator, don’t\nforget to create unit tests for it. If you implement anything else, it is encouraged that you develop complimentary regression tests for it.\n\nThe regression test and unit test utilities are native and do not demand any\nexternal tool or script, although you need to fetch the test cases from other\nrepositories, as they are shared with other versions of ModSecurity, those\nothers repositories git submodules. To fetch the submodules repository and run\nthe utilities, follow the commands listed below:\n\n```shell\n$ cd /path/to/your/ModSecurity\n$ git submodule update --init --recursive\n$ make check\n ```\n\n### Debugging\n\n\nBefore start the debugging process, make sure of where your bug is. The problem\ncould be on your connector or in libmodsecurity. In order to identify where the\nbug is, it is recommended that you develop a regression test that mimics the\nscenario where the bug is happening. If the bug is reproducible with the\nregression-test utility, then it will be far simpler to debug and ensure that it never occurs again. On Linux it is\nrecommended that anyone undertaking debugging utilize gdb and/or valgrind as needed.\n\nDuring the configuration/compilation time, you may want to disable the compiler\noptimization making your “back traces” populated with readable data. Use the\nCFLAGS to disable the compilation optimization parameters:\n\n```shell\n$ export CFLAGS=\"-g -O0\"\n$ ./build.sh\n$ ./configure --enable-assertions=yes\n$ make\n$ sudo make install\n```\n\"Assertions allow us to document assumptions and to spot violations early in the\ndevelopment process. What is more, assertions allow us to spot violations with a\nminimum of effort.\" https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/240964.240969\n\nIt is recommended to use assertions where applicable, and to enable them with\n'--enable-assertions=yes' during the testing and debugging workflow.\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nThe source tree includes a Benchmark tool that can help measure library performance. The tool is located in the `test/benchmark/` directory. The build process also creates the binary here, so you will have the tool after the compilation is finished.\n\nTo run, just type:\n\n```shell\ncd test/benchmark\n$ ./benchmark\nDoing 1000000 transactions...\n\n```\n\nYou can also pass a lower value:\n\n```shell\n$ ./benchmark 1000\nDoing 1000 transactions...\n```\n\nTo measure the time:\n```shell\n$ time ./benchmark 1000\nDoing 1000 transactions...\n\nreal\t0m0.351s\nuser\t0m0.337s\nsys\t0m0.022s\n```\n\nThis is very fast because the benchmark uses the minimal `modsecurity.conf.default` configuration, which doesn't include too many rules:\n\n```shell\n$ cat basic_rules.conf\n\nInclude \"../../modsecurity.conf-recommended\"\n\n```\n\nTo measure with real rules, run one of the download scripts in the same directory:\n\n```shell\n$ ./download-owasp-v3-rules.sh\nCloning into 'owasp-v3'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 33007, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (2581/2581), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (907/907), done.\nremote: Total 33007 (delta 2151), reused 2004 (delta 1638), pack-reused 30426\nReceiving objects: 100% (33007/33007), 9.02 MiB | 16.21 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (25927/25927), done.\nSwitched to a new branch 'tag3.0.2'\n/path/to/ModSecurity/test/benchmark\nDone.\n\n$ cat basic_rules.conf\n\nInclude \"../../modsecurity.conf-recommended\"\n\nInclude \"owasp-v3/crs-setup.conf.example\"\nInclude \"owasp-v3/rules/*.conf\"\n```\n\nNow the command will give much higher value.\n\n#### How the benchmark works\n\nThe tool is a straightforward wrapper application that utilizes the library. It creates a ModSecurity instance and a RuleSet instance, then runs a loop based on the specified number. Within this loop, it creates a Transaction object to emulate real HTTP transactions.\n\nEach transaction is an HTTP/1.1 GET request with some GET parameters. Common headers are added, followed by the response headers and an XML body. Between phases, the tool checks whether an intervention has occurred. All transactions are created with the same data.\n\nNote that the tool does not call the last phase (logging).\n\nPlease remember to reset `basic_rules.conf` if you want to try with a different ruleset.\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nIf you are facing a configuration issue or something is not working as you\nexpected to be, please use the ModSecurity user’s mailing list. Issues on GitHub\nare also welcomed, but we prefer to have user ask questions on the mailing list first so that you can reach an entire community. Also don’t forget to look for existing issues before open a new one.\n\nIf you are going to open a new issue on GitHub, don’t forget to tell us the\nversion of your libmodsecurity and the version of a specific connector if there\nis one.\n\n\n### Security issue\n\nPlease do not make public any security issue. Contact us at:\nmodsecurity@owasp.org reporting the issue. Once the problem is fixed your\ncredit will be given.\n\n## Feature request\n\nWe are open to discussing any new feature request with the community via the mailing lists. You can alternativly,\nfeel free to open GitHub issues requesting new features. Before opening a\nnew issue, please check if there is one already opened on the same topic.\n\n## Bindings\n\nThe libModSecurity design allows the integration with bindings. There is an effort to avoid breaking API [binary] compatibility to make an easy integration with possible bindings. Currently, there are a few notable projects maintained by the community:\n   * Python - https://github.com/actions-security/pymodsecurity\n   * Rust - https://github.com/rkrishn7/rust-modsecurity\n   * Varnish - https://github.com/xdecock/vmod-modsecurity\n\n## Packaging\n\nHaving our packages in distros on time is a desire that we have, so let us know\nif there is anything we can do to facilitate your work as a packager.\n\n## Sponsor Note\n\nDevelopment of ModSecurity is sponsored by Trustwave. Sponsorship will end July 1, 2024.

Spreadsheets are used by Billion+ humans collaboratively every single day. However, we are way off working at similar speeds on databases which are way more powerful tools when it comes to computing. Attempts to solve this with SaaS offerings have meant horrible access controls, vendor lock-in, data lock-in, abrupt price changes & most importantly a glass ceiling on what's possible in the future.\n\n# Our Mission\n\nOur mission is to provide the most powerful no-code interface for databases that is open source to every single internet business in the world. This would not only democratise access to a powerful computing tool but also bring forth a billion+ people who will have radical tinkering-and-building abilities on the internet.\n\n# License\n\n<p>\nThis project is licensed under <a href=\"./LICENSE\">AGPLv3</a>.\n</p>\n\n# Contributors\n\nThank you for your contributions!

An image library including image response serializers, `UIImage` and `UIImageView` extensions, custom image filters, an auto-purging in-memory cache, and a priority-based image downloading system.\n- [AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator) - Controls the visibility of the network activity indicator on iOS using Alamofire. It contains configurable delay timers to help mitigate flicker and can support `URLSession` instances not managed by Alamofire.\n\n## Requirements\n\n| Platform                                             | Minimum Swift Version | Installation                                                                                                         | Status                   |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| iOS 10.0+ / macOS 10.12+ / tvOS 10.0+ / watchOS 3.0+ | 6.0 / Xcode 16.0      | [CocoaPods](#cocoapods), [Carthage](#carthage), [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager), [Manual](#manually) | Fully Tested             |\n| Linux                                                | Latest Only           | [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)                                                                      | Building But Unsupported |\n| Windows                                              | Latest Only           | [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)                                                                      | Building But Unsupported |\n| Android                                              | Latest Only           | [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)                                                                      | Building But Unsupported |\n\n#### Known Issues on Linux and Windows\n\nAlamofire builds on Linux, Windows, and Android but there are missing features and many issues in the underlying `swift-corelibs-foundation` that prevent full functionality and may cause crashes. These include:\n\n- `ServerTrustManager` and associated certificate functionality is unavailable, so there is no certificate pinning and no client certificate support.\n- Various methods of HTTP authentication may crash, including HTTP Basic and HTTP Digest. Crashes may occur if responses contain server challenges.\n- Cache control through `CachedResponseHandler` and associated APIs is unavailable, as the underlying delegate methods aren't called.\n- `URLSessionTaskMetrics` are never gathered.\n- `WebSocketRequest` is not available.\n\nDue to these issues, Alamofire is unsupported on Linux, Windows, and Android. Please report any crashes to the [Swift bug reporter](https://bugs.swift.org).\n\n## Migration Guides\n\n- [Alamofire 5.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Alamofire%205.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)\n- [Alamofire 4.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Alamofire%204.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)\n- [Alamofire 3.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Alamofire%203.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)\n- [Alamofire 2.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Alamofire%202.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)\n\n## Communication\n\n- If you **need help with making network requests** using Alamofire, use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/alamofire) and tag `alamofire`.\n- If you need to **find or understand an API**, check [our documentation](http://alamofire.github.io/Alamofire/) or [Apple's documentation for `URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system), on top of which Alamofire is built.\n- If you need **help with an Alamofire feature**, use [our forum on swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire).\n- If you'd like to **discuss Alamofire best practices**, use [our forum on swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire).\n- If you'd like to **discuss a feature request**, use [our forum on swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire).\n- If you **found a bug**, open an issue here on GitHub and follow the guide. The more detail the better!\n\n## Installation\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nThe [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.\n\nOnce you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift` or the Package list in Xcode.\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"5.11.0\"))\n]\n```\n\nNormally you'll want to depend on the `Alamofire` target:\n\n```swift\n.product(name: \"Alamofire\", package: \"Alamofire\")\n```\n\nBut if you want to force Alamofire to be dynamically linked (do not do this unless you're sure you need it), you can depend on the `AlamofireDynamic` target:\n\n```swift\n.product(name: \"AlamofireDynamic\", package: \"Alamofire\")\n```\n\n### CocoaPods\n\n[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\npod 'Alamofire'\n```\n\n### Carthage\n\n[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:\n\n```ogdl\ngithub \"Alamofire/Alamofire\"\n```\n\n### Manually\n\nIf you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Alamofire into your project manually.\n\n#### Embedded Framework\n\n- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory, and run the following command \"if\" your project is not initialized as a git repository:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ git init\n  ```\n\n- Add Alamofire as a git [submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following command:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ git submodule add https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git\n  ```\n\n- Open the new `Alamofire` folder, and drag the `Alamofire.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.\n\n  > It should appear nested underneath your application's blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.\n\n- Select the `Alamofire.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.\n- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the \"Targets\" heading in the sidebar.\n- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the \"General\" panel.\n- Click on the `+` button under the \"Embedded Binaries\" section.\n- You will see two different `Alamofire.xcodeproj` folders each with two different versions of the `Alamofire.framework` nested inside a `Products` folder.\n\n  > It does not matter which `Products` folder you choose from, but it does matter whether you choose the top or bottom `Alamofire.framework`.\n\n- Select the top `Alamofire.framework` for iOS and the bottom one for macOS.\n\n  > You can verify which one you selected by inspecting the build log for your project. The build target for `Alamofire` will be listed as `Alamofire iOS`, `Alamofire macOS`, `Alamofire tvOS`, or `Alamofire watchOS`.\n\n- And that's it!\n\n  > The `Alamofire.framework` is automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore contributing to Alamofire, please read the instructions detailed in our [contribution guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Open Radars\n\nThe following radars have some effect on the current implementation of Alamofire.\n\n- [`rdar://21349340`](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5517037090635776) - Compiler throwing warning due to toll-free bridging issue in the test case\n- `rdar://26870455` - Background URL Session Configurations do not work in the simulator\n- `rdar://26849668` - Some URLProtocol APIs do not properly handle `URLRequest`\n\n## Resolved Radars\n\nThe following radars have been resolved over time after being filed against the Alamofire project.\n\n- [`rdar://26761490`](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5010235949318144) - Swift string interpolation causing memory leak with common usage.\n  - (Resolved): 9/1/17 in Xcode 9 beta 6.\n- [`rdar://36082113`](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=4942308441063424) - `URLSessionTaskMetrics` failing to link on watchOS 3.0+\n  - (Resolved): Just add `CFNetwork` to your linked frameworks.\n- `FB7624529` - `urlSession(_:task:didFinishCollecting:)` never called on watchOS\n  - (Resolved): Metrics now collected on watchOS 7+.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What's the origin of the name Alamofire?\n\nAlamofire is named after the [Alamo Fire flower](https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/alamofire.html), a hybrid variant of the Bluebonnet, the official state flower of Texas.\n\n## Credits\n\nAlamofire is owned and maintained by the [Alamofire Software Foundation](http://alamofire.org).

      "readme": "# Apache Flink\n\nApache Flink is an open source stream processing framework with powerful stream- and batch-processing capabilities.\n\nLearn more about Flink at [https://flink.apache.org/](https://flink.apache.org/)\n\n\n### Features\n\n* A streaming-first runtime that supports both batch processing and data streaming programs\n\n* Elegant and fluent APIs in Java\n\n* A runtime that supports very high throughput and low event latency at the same time\n\n* Support for *event time* and *out-of-order* processing in the DataStream API, based on the *Dataflow Model*\n\n* Flexible windowing (time, count, sessions, custom triggers) across different time semantics (event time, processing time)\n\n* Fault-tolerance with *exactly-once* processing guarantees\n\n* Natural back-pressure in streaming programs\n\n* Libraries for Graph processing (batch), Machine Learning (batch), and Complex Event Processing (streaming)\n\n* Custom memory management for efficient and robust switching between in-memory and out-of-core data processing algorithms\n\n* Compatibility layers for Apache Hadoop MapReduce\n\n* Integration with YARN, HDFS, HBase, and other components of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem\n\n\n### Streaming Example\n```java\n// pojo class WordWithCount\npublic class WordWithCount {\n    public String word;\n    public int count;\n\n    public WordWithCount() {}\n    \n    public WordWithCount(String word, int count) {\n        this.word = word;\n        this.count = count;\n    }\n}\n\n// main method\nStreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();\nDataStreamSource<String> text = env.socketTextStream(host, port);\nDataStream<WordWithCount> windowCounts = text\n    .flatMap(\n        (FlatMapFunction<String, String>) (line, collector) \n            -> Arrays.stream(line.split(\"\\\\s\")).forEach(collector::collect)\n    ).returns(String.class)\n    .map(word -> new WordWithCount(word, 1)).returns(TypeInformation.of(WordWithCount.class))\n    .keyBy(wordWithCnt -> wordWithCnt.word)\n    .window(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Duration.ofSeconds(5)))\n    .sum(\"count\").returns(TypeInformation.of(WordWithCount.class));\n\nwindowCounts.print();\nenv.execute();\n}\n```\n\n### Batch Example\n```java\n// pojo class WordWithCount\npublic class WordWithCount {\n    public String word;\n    public int count;\n\n    public WordWithCount() {}\n\n    public WordWithCount(String word, int count) {\n        this.word = word;\n        this.count = count;\n    }\n}\n\n// main method\nStreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();\nenv.setRuntimeMode(RuntimeExecutionMode.BATCH);\nFileSource<String> source = FileSource.forRecordStreamFormat(new TextLineInputFormat(), new Path(\"MyInput.txt\")).build();\nDataStreamSource<String> text = env.fromSource(source, WatermarkStrategy.noWatermarks(), \"MySource\");\nDataStream<WordWithCount> windowCounts = text\n        .flatMap((FlatMapFunction<String, String>) (line, collector) -> Arrays\n                .stream(line.split(\"\\\\s\"))\n                .forEach(collector::collect)).returns(String.class)\n        .map(word -> new WordWithCount(word, 1)).returns(TypeInformation.of(WordWithCount.class))\n        .keyBy(wordWithCount -> wordWithCount.word)\n        .sum(\"count\").returns(TypeInformation.of(WordWithCount.class));\n\nwindowCounts.print();\nenv.execute();\n```\n\n\n\n## Building Apache Flink from Source\n\nPrerequisites for building Flink:\n\n* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin, WSL)\n* Git\n* Maven (we require version 3.8.6)\n* Java (version 11, 17, or 21)\n\n### Basic Build Instructions\n\nFirst, clone the repository:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/flink.git\ncd flink\n```\n\nThen, choose one of the following commands based on your preferred Java version:\n\n**For Java 11**\n\n```\n./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Djdk11 -Pjava11-target\n```\n\n**For Java 17 (Default)**\n\n```\n./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Djdk17 -Pjava17-target\n```\n\n**For Java 21**\n\n```\n./mvnw clean package -DskipTests -Djdk21 -Pjava21-target\n```\n\nThe build process will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.\nFlink will be installed in `build-target`.\n\n### Notes\n\n* Make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable points to the correct JDK version\n* The build command uses Maven wrapper (mvnw) which ensures the correct Maven version is used\n* The -DskipTests flag skips running tests to speed up the build process\n* Each Java version requires its corresponding profile (-Pjava<version>-target) and JDK flag (-Djdk<version>)\n\n## Developing Flink\n\nThe Flink committers use IntelliJ IDEA to develop the Flink codebase.\nWe recommend IntelliJ IDEA for developing projects that involve Scala code.\n\nMinimal requirements for an IDE are:\n* Support for Java and Scala (also mixed projects)\n* Support for Maven with Java and Scala\n\n\n### IntelliJ IDEA\n\nThe IntelliJ IDE supports Maven out of the box and offers a plugin for Scala development.\n\n* IntelliJ download: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)\n* IntelliJ Scala Plugin: [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347)\n\nCheck out our [Setting up IntelliJ](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/flinkDev/ide_setup.html#intellij-idea) guide for details.\n\n### Eclipse Scala IDE\n\n**NOTE:** From our experience, this setup does not work with Flink\ndue to deficiencies of the old Eclipse version bundled with Scala IDE 3.0.3 or\ndue to version incompatibilities with the bundled Scala version in Scala IDE 4.4.1.\n\n**We recommend to use IntelliJ instead (see above)**\n\n## Support\n\nDon’t hesitate to ask!\n\nContact the developers and community on the [mailing lists](https://flink.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists) if you need any help.\n\n[Open an issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK) if you find a bug in Flink.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation of Apache Flink is located on the website: [https://flink.apache.org](https://flink.apache.org)\nor in the `docs/` directory of the source code.\n\n\n## Fork and Contribute\n\nThis is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to use the system or contribute to it.\nContact us if you are looking for implementation tasks that fit your skills.\nThis article describes [how to contribute to Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/how-to-contribute.html).\n\n## Externalized Connectors\n\nMost Flink connectors have been externalized to individual repos under the [Apache Software Foundation](https://github.com/apache):\n\n* [flink-connector-aws](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-aws)\n* [flink-connector-cassandra](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-cassandra)\n* [flink-connector-elasticsearch](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-elasticsearch)\n* [flink-connector-gcp-pubsub](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-gcp-pubsub)\n* [flink-connector-hbase](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-hbase)\n* [flink-connector-hive](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-hive)\n* [flink-connector-jdbc](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-jdbc)\n* [flink-connector-kafka](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-kafka)\n* [flink-connector-mongodb](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-mongodb)\n* [flink-connector-opensearch](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-opensearch)\n* [flink-connector-prometheus](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-prometheus)\n* [flink-connector-pulsar](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-pulsar)\n* [flink-connector-rabbitmq](https://github.com/apache/flink-connector-rabbitmq)\n\n## About\n\nApache Flink is an open source project of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF).\nThe Apache Flink project originated from the [Stratosphere](http://stratosphere.eu) research project.\n",

This package contains the following products:\n\n- `NIO`. This is an umbrella module exporting `NIOCore`, `NIOEmbedded` and `NIOPosix`.\n- `NIOCore`. This provides the core abstractions and types for using SwiftNIO (see [\"Conceptual Overview\"](#conceptual-overview) for more details). Most NIO extension projects that provide things like new [`EventLoop`s][el] and [`Channel`s][c] or new protocol implementations should only need to depend on `NIOCore`.\n- `NIOPosix`. This provides the primary [`EventLoopGroup`], [`EventLoop`][el], and [`Channel`s][c] for use on POSIX-based systems. This is our high performance core I/O layer. In general, this should only be imported by projects that plan to do some actual I/O, such as high-level protocol implementations or applications.\n- `NIOEmbedded`. This provides [`EmbeddedChannel`][ec] and [`EmbeddedEventLoop`][eel], implementations of the `NIOCore` abstractions that provide fine-grained control over their execution. These are most often used for testing, but can also be used to drive protocol implementations in a way that is decoupled from networking altogether.\n- `NIOConcurrencyHelpers`. This provides a few low-level concurrency primitives that are used by NIO implementations, such as locks and atomics.\n- `NIOFoundationCompat`. This extends a number of NIO types for better interoperation with Foundation data types. If you are working with Foundation data types such as `Data`, you should import this.\n- `NIOTLS`. This provides a few common abstraction types for working with multiple TLS implementations. Note that this doesn't provide TLS itself: please investigate [swift-nio-ssl][repo-nio-ssl] and [swift-nio-transport-services][repo-nio-transport-services] for concrete implementations.\n- `NIOHTTP1`. This provides a low-level HTTP/1.1 protocol implementation.\n- `NIOWebSocket`. This provides a low-level WebSocket protocol implementation.\n- `NIOTestUtils`. This provides a number of helpers for testing projects that use SwiftNIO.\n- `NIOFileSystem`. This provides `async` APIs for interacting with the file system.\n\n### Protocol Implementations\n\nBelow you can find a list of a few protocol implementations that are done with SwiftNIO. This is a non-exhaustive list of protocols that are either part of the SwiftNIO project or are accepted into the [SSWG](https://swift.org/server)'s incubation process. All of the libraries listed below do all of their I/O in a non-blocking fashion using SwiftNIO.\n\n#### Low-level protocol implementations\n\nLow-level protocol implementations are often a collection of [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s that implement a protocol but still require the user to have a good understanding of SwiftNIO. Often, low-level protocol implementations will then be wrapped in high-level libraries with a nicer, more user-friendly API.\n\nProtocol | Client<br />(Sends requests) | Server<br />(Responds to requests) | Repository | Module | Comment\n--- |  --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nHTTP/1 | ✅| ✅ | [apple/swift-nio](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) | [`NIOHTTP1`][nioh1] | official NIO project\nHTTP/2 | ✅| ✅ | [apple/swift-nio-http2](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-http2) | [`NIOHTTP2`][nioh2] | official NIO project\nWebSocket | ✅| ✅ | [apple/swift-nio](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) | [`NIOWebSocket`][niows] | official NIO project\nTLS | ✅ | ✅ | [apple/swift-nio-ssl](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio-ssl) | [`NIOSSL`][niossl] | official NIO project\nSSH | ✅ | ✅ | [apple/swift-nio-ssh][repo-nio-ssh] | [`NIOSSH`][niossh] | official NIO project\n\n\n#### High-level implementations\n\nHigh-level implementations are usually libraries that come with an API that doesn't expose SwiftNIO's [`ChannelPipeline`][cp] and can therefore be used with very little (or no) SwiftNIO-specific knowledge.

The Core NIO team does not actively work on this version.  No new features will be added to this version but PRs which fix bugs or security vulnerabilities will be accepted until the end of May 2022.\n\nIf you have a SwiftNIO 1 application or library that you would like to migrate to SwiftNIO 2, please check out the [migration guide](docs/migration-guide-NIO1-to-NIO2.md) we prepared for you.\n\nThe latest released SwiftNIO 1 version supports Swift 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and 5.0.\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nSwiftNIO aims to support all of the platforms where Swift is supported. Currently, it is developed and tested on macOS and Linux, and is known to support the following operating system versions:\n\n* Ubuntu 18.04+\n* macOS 10.9+, iOS 7+; (macOS 10.14+, iOS 12+, tvOS 12+ or watchOS 6+ with [swift-nio-transport-services][repo-nio-transport-services])\n\nSwiftNIO has experimental support on OpenBSD for all SwiftNIO libraries _except_ for NIOFileSystem, which is not yet supported. You can use all other SwiftNIO libraries on OpenBSD by adding them as dependencies in `Package.swift`.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nSwiftNIO follows [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200) with a separate document declaring [SwiftNIO's Public API](docs/public-api.md).\n\nWhat this means for you is that you should depend on SwiftNIO with a version range that covers everything from the minimum SwiftNIO version you require up to the next major version.\nIn SwiftPM that can be easily done specifying for example `from: \"2.0.0\"` meaning that you support SwiftNIO in every version starting from 2.0.0 up to (excluding) 3.0.0.\nSemVer and SwiftNIO's Public API guarantees should result in a working program without having to worry about testing every single version for compatibility.\n\n\n## Conceptual Overview\n\nSwiftNIO is fundamentally a low-level tool for building high-performance networking applications in Swift. It particularly targets those use-cases where using a \"thread-per-connection\" model of concurrency is inefficient or untenable. This is a common limitation when building servers that use a large number of relatively low-utilization connections, such as HTTP servers.\n\nTo achieve its goals, SwiftNIO extensively uses \"non-blocking I/O\": hence the name! Non-blocking I/O differs from the more common blocking I/O model because the application does not wait for data to be sent to or received from the network: instead, SwiftNIO asks for the kernel to notify it when I/O operations can be performed without waiting.\n\nSwiftNIO does not aim to provide high-level solutions like, for example, web frameworks do. Instead, SwiftNIO is focused on providing the low-level building blocks for these higher-level applications. When it comes to building a web application, most users will not want to use SwiftNIO directly: instead, they'll want to use one of the many great web frameworks available in the Swift ecosystem. Those web frameworks, however, may choose to use SwiftNIO under the covers to provide their networking support.\n\nThe following sections will describe the low-level tools that SwiftNIO provides, and provide a quick overview of how to work with them. If you feel comfortable with these concepts, then you can skip right ahead to the other sections of this README.\n\n### Basic Architecture\n\nThe basic building blocks of SwiftNIO are the following 8 types of objects:\n\n- [`EventLoopGroup`][elg], a protocol, provided by `NIOCore`.\n- [`EventLoop`][el], a protocol, provided by `NIOCore`.\n- [`Channel`][c], a protocol, provided by `NIOCore`.\n- [`ChannelHandler`][ch], a protocol, provided by `NIOCore`.\n- `Bootstrap`, several related structures, provided by `NIOCore`.\n- [`ByteBuffer`][bb], a struct, provided by `NIOCore`.\n- [`EventLoopFuture`][elf], a generic class, provided by `NIOCore`.\n- [`EventLoopPromise`][elp], a generic struct, provided by `NIOCore`.\n\nAll SwiftNIO applications are ultimately constructed of these various components.\n\n#### EventLoops and EventLoopGroups\n\nThe basic I/O primitive of SwiftNIO is the event loop. The event loop is an object that waits for events (usually I/O related events, such as \"data received\") to happen and then fires some kind of callback when they do. In almost all SwiftNIO applications there will be relatively few event loops: usually only one or two per CPU core the application wants to use. Generally speaking, event loops run for the entire lifetime of your application, spinning in an endless loop dispatching events.\n\nEvent loops are gathered together into event loop *groups*. These groups provide a mechanism to distribute work around the event loops. For example, when listening for inbound connections the listening socket will be registered on one event loop. However, we don't want all connections that are accepted on that listening socket to be registered with the same event loop, as that would potentially overload one event loop while leaving the others empty. For that reason, the event loop group provides the ability to spread load across multiple event loops.\n\nIn SwiftNIO today there is one [`EventLoopGroup`][elg] implementation, and two [`EventLoop`][el] implementations. For production applications there is the [`MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup`][mtelg], an [`EventLoopGroup`][elg] that creates a number of threads (using the POSIX [`pthreads`][pthreads] library) and places one `SelectableEventLoop` on each one. The `SelectableEventLoop` is an event loop that uses a selector (either [`kqueue`][kqueue] or [`epoll`][epoll] depending on the target system) to manage I/O events from file descriptors and to dispatch work. These [`EventLoop`s][el] and [`EventLoopGroup`s][elg] are provided by the `NIOPosix` module. Additionally, there is the [`EmbeddedEventLoop`][eel], which is a dummy event loop that is used primarily for testing purposes, provided by the `NIOEmbedded` module.\n\n[`EventLoop`][el]s have a number of important properties. Most vitally, they are the way all work gets done in SwiftNIO applications. In order to ensure thread-safety, any work that wants to be done on almost any of the other objects in SwiftNIO must be dispatched via an [`EventLoop`][el]. [`EventLoop`][el] objects own almost all the other objects in a SwiftNIO application, and understanding their execution model is critical for building high-performance SwiftNIO applications.\n\n#### Channels, Channel Handlers, Channel Pipelines, and Channel Contexts\n\nWhile [`EventLoop`][el]s are critical to the way SwiftNIO works, most users will not interact with them substantially beyond asking them to create [`EventLoopPromise`][elp]s and to schedule work. The parts of a SwiftNIO application most users will spend the most time interacting with are [`Channel`][c]s and [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s.\n\nAlmost every file descriptor that a user interacts with in a SwiftNIO program is associated with a single [`Channel`][c]. The [`Channel`][c] owns this file descriptor, and is responsible for managing its lifetime. It is also responsible for processing inbound and outbound events on that file descriptor: whenever the event loop has an event that corresponds to a file descriptor, it will notify the [`Channel`][c] that owns that file descriptor.\n\n[`Channel`][c]s by themselves, however, are not useful. After all, it is a rare application that doesn't want to do anything with the data it sends or receives on a socket! So the other important part of the [`Channel`][c] is the [`ChannelPipeline`][cp].\n\nA [`ChannelPipeline`][cp] is a sequence of objects, called [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s, that process events on a [`Channel`][c]. The [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s process these events one after another, in order, mutating and transforming events as they go. This can be thought of as a data processing pipeline; hence the name [`ChannelPipeline`][cp].\n\nAll [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s are either Inbound or Outbound handlers, or both. Inbound handlers process \"inbound\" events: events like reading data from a socket, reading socket close, or other kinds of events initiated by remote peers. Outbound handlers process \"outbound\" events, such as writes, connection attempts, and local socket closes.\n\nEach handler processes the events in order. For example, read events are passed from the front of the pipeline to the back, one handler at a time, while write events are passed from the back of the pipeline to the front. Each handler may, at any time, generate either inbound or outbound events that will be sent to the next handler in whichever direction is appropriate. This allows handlers to split up reads, coalesce writes, delay connection attempts, and generally perform arbitrary transformations of events.\n\nIn general, [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s are designed to be highly re-usable components. This means they tend to be designed to be as small as possible, performing one specific data transformation. This allows handlers to be composed together in novel and flexible ways, which helps with code reuse and encapsulation.\n\n[`ChannelHandler`][ch]s are able to keep track of where they are in a [`ChannelPipeline`][cp] by using a [`ChannelHandlerContext`][chc]. These objects contain references to the previous and next channel handler in the pipeline, ensuring that it is always possible for a [`ChannelHandler`][ch] to emit events while it remains in a pipeline.\n\nSwiftNIO ships with many [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s built in that provide useful functionality, such as HTTP parsing. In addition, high-performance applications will want to provide as much of their logic as possible in [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s, as it helps avoid problems with context switching.\n\nAdditionally, SwiftNIO ships with a few [`Channel`][c] implementations. In particular, it ships with `ServerSocketChannel`, a [`Channel`][c] for sockets that accept inbound connections; `SocketChannel`, a [`Channel`][c] for TCP connections; and `DatagramChannel`, a [`Channel`][c] for UDP sockets. All of these are provided by the `NIOPosix` module. It also provides [`EmbeddedChannel`][ec], a [`Channel`][c] primarily used for testing, provided by the `NIOEmbedded` module.\n\n##### A Note on Blocking\n\nOne of the important notes about [`ChannelPipeline`][cp]s is that they are thread-safe. This is very important for writing SwiftNIO applications, as it allows you to write much simpler [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s in the knowledge that they will not require synchronization.\n\nHowever, this is achieved by dispatching all code on the [`ChannelPipeline`][cp] on the same thread as the [`EventLoop`][el]. This means that, as a general rule, [`ChannelHandler`][ch]s **must not** call blocking code without dispatching it to a background thread. If a [`ChannelHandler`][ch] blocks for any reason, all [`Channel`][c]s attached to the parent [`EventLoop`][el] will be unable to progress until the blocking call completes.\n\nThis is a common concern while writing SwiftNIO applications. If it is useful to write code in a blocking style, it is highly recommended that you dispatch work to a different thread when you're done with it in your pipeline.\n\n#### Bootstrap\n\nWhile it is possible to configure and register [`Channel`][c]s with [`EventLoop`][el]s directly, it is generally more useful to have a higher-level abstraction to handle this work.\n\nFor this reason, SwiftNIO ships a number of `Bootstrap` objects whose purpose is to streamline the creation of channels. Some `Bootstrap` objects also provide other functionality, such as support for Happy Eyeballs for making TCP connection attempts.\n\nCurrently SwiftNIO ships with three `Bootstrap` objects in the `NIOPosix` module: [`ServerBootstrap`][sbootstrap], for bootstrapping listening channels; [`ClientBootstrap`][cbootstrap], for bootstrapping client TCP channels; and [`DatagramBootstrap`][dbootstrap] for bootstrapping UDP channels.\n\n#### ByteBuffer\n\nThe majority of the work in a SwiftNIO application involves shuffling buffers of bytes around. At the very least, data is sent and received to and from the network in the form of buffers of bytes. For this reason it's very important to have a high-performance data structure that is optimized for the kind of work SwiftNIO applications perform.\n\nFor this reason, SwiftNIO provides [`ByteBuffer`][bb], a fast copy-on-write byte buffer that forms a key building block of most SwiftNIO applications. This type is provided by the `NIOCore` module.\n\n[`ByteBuffer`][bb] provides a number of useful features, and in addition provides a number of hooks to use it in an \"unsafe\" mode. This turns off bounds checking for improved performance, at the cost of potentially opening your application up to memory correctness problems.\n\nIn general, it is highly recommended that you use the [`ByteBuffer`][bb] in its safe mode at all times.\n\nFor more details on the API of [`ByteBuffer`][bb], please see our API documentation, linked below.\n\n#### Promises and Futures\n\nOne major difference between writing concurrent code and writing synchronous code is that not all actions will complete immediately. For example, when you write data on a channel, it is possible that the event loop will not be able to immediately flush that write out to the network. For this reason, SwiftNIO provides [`EventLoopPromise<T>`][elp] and [`EventLoopFuture<T>`][elf] to manage operations that complete *asynchronously*. These types are provided by the `NIOCore` module.\n\nAn [`EventLoopFuture<T>`][elf] is essentially a container for the return value of a function that will be populated *at some time in the future*. Each [`EventLoopFuture<T>`][elf] has a corresponding [`EventLoopPromise<T>`][elp], which is the object that the result will be put into. When the promise is succeeded, the future will be fulfilled.\n\nIf you had to poll the future to detect when it completed that would be quite inefficient, so [`EventLoopFuture<T>`][elf] is designed to have managed callbacks. Essentially, you can chain callbacks off the future that will be executed when a result is available. The [`EventLoopFuture<T>`][elf] will even carefully arrange the scheduling to ensure that these callbacks always execute on the event loop that initially created the promise, which helps ensure that you don't need too much synchronization around [`EventLoopFuture<T>`][elf] callbacks.\n\nAnother important topic for consideration is the difference between how the promise passed to `close` works as opposed to `closeFuture` on a [`Channel`][c]. For example, the promise passed into `close` will succeed after the [`Channel`][c] is closed down but before the [`ChannelPipeline`][cp] is completely cleared out. This will allow you to take action on the [`ChannelPipeline`][cp] before it is completely cleared out, if needed. If it is desired to wait for the [`Channel`][c] to close down and the [`ChannelPipeline`][cp] to be cleared out without any further action, then the better option would be to wait for the `closeFuture` to succeed.\n\nThere are several functions for applying callbacks to [`EventLoopFuture<T>`][elf], depending on how and when you want them to execute. Details of these functions is left to the API documentation.\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\nSwiftNIO is designed to be a powerful tool for building networked applications and frameworks, but it is not intended to be the perfect solution for all levels of abstraction. SwiftNIO is tightly focused on providing the basic I/O primitives and protocol implementations at low levels of abstraction, leaving more expressive but slower abstractions to the wider community to build. The intention is that SwiftNIO will be a building block for server-side applications, not necessarily the framework those applications will use directly.\n\nApplications that need extremely high performance from their networking stack may choose to use SwiftNIO directly in order to reduce the overhead of their abstractions. These applications should be able to maintain extremely high performance with relatively little maintenance cost. SwiftNIO also focuses on providing useful abstractions for this use-case, such that extremely high performance network servers can be built directly.\n\nThe core SwiftNIO repository will contain a few extremely important protocol implementations, such as HTTP, directly in tree. However, we believe that most protocol implementations should be decoupled from the release cycle of the underlying networking stack, as the release cadence is likely to be very different (either much faster or much slower). For this reason, we actively encourage the community to develop and maintain their protocol implementations out-of-tree. Indeed, some first-party SwiftNIO protocol implementations, including our TLS and HTTP/2 bindings, are developed out-of-tree!\n\n## Documentation\n\n - [API documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-nio/documentation/nio)\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThere are currently several example projects that demonstrate how to use SwiftNIO.\n\n- **chat client** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOChatClient\n- **chat server** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOChatServer\n- **echo client** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOEchoClient\n- **echo server** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOEchoServer\n- **UDP echo client** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOUDPEchoClient\n- **UDP echo server** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOUDPEchoServer\n- **HTTP client** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOHTTP1Client\n- **HTTP server** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOHTTP1Server\n- **WebSocket client** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOWebSocketClient\n- **WebSocket server** https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/tree/main/Sources/NIOWebSocketServer\n\nTo build & run them, run following command, replace TARGET_NAME with the folder name under `./Sources`\n\n```bash\nswift run TARGET_NAME\n```\n\nFor example, to run NIOHTTP1Server, run following command:\n\n```bash\nswift run NIOHTTP1Server\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nSwiftNIO primarily uses [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/) as its build tool, so we recommend using that as well. If you want to depend on SwiftNIO in your own project, it's as simple as adding a `dependencies` clause to your `Package.swift`:\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/apple/swift-nio.git\", from: \"2.0.0\")\n]\n```\n\nand then adding the appropriate SwiftNIO module(s) to your target dependencies.\nThe syntax for adding target dependencies differs slightly between Swift\nversions. For example, if you want to depend on the `NIOCore`, `NIOPosix` and\n`NIOHTTP1` modules, specify the following dependencies:\n\n#### Swift 5.4 and newer (`swift-tools-version:5.4`)\n\n    dependencies: [.product(name: \"NIOCore\", package: \"swift-nio\"),\n                   .product(name: \"NIOPosix\", package: \"swift-nio\"),\n                   .product(name: \"NIOHTTP1\", package: \"swift-nio\")]\n\n### Using Xcode Package support\n\nIf your project is set up as an Xcode project and you're using Xcode 11+, you can add SwiftNIO as a dependency to your\nXcode project by clicking File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency. In the upcoming dialog, please enter\n`https://github.com/apple/swift-nio.git` and click Next twice. Finally, select the targets you are planning to use (for\nexample `NIOCore`, `NIOHTTP1`, and `NIOFoundationCompat`) and click finish. Now will be able to `import NIOCore` (as well as all\nthe other targets you have selected) in your project.\n\nTo work on SwiftNIO itself, or to investigate some of the demonstration applications, you can clone the repository directly and use SwiftPM to help build it. For example, you can run the following commands to compile and run the example echo server:\n\n```bash\nswift build\nswift test\nswift run NIOEchoServer\n```\n\nTo verify that it is working, you can use another shell to attempt to connect to it:\n\n```bash\necho \"Hello SwiftNIO\" | nc localhost 9999\n```\n\nIf all goes well, you'll see the message echoed back to you.\n\nTo work on SwiftNIO in Xcode, you can just open the `Package.swift`\nfile in Xcode and use Xcode's support for SwiftPM Packages.\n\n## Developing SwiftNIO\n\n*Note*: This section is only relevant if you would like to develop SwiftNIO yourself. You can ignore the information here if you just want to use SwiftNIO as a SwiftPM package.\n\nFor the most part, SwiftNIO development is as straightforward as any other SwiftPM project. With that said, we do have a few processes that are worth understanding before you contribute. For details, please see `CONTRIBUTING.md` in this repository.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nSwiftNIO's `main` branch is the development branch for the next releases of SwiftNIO 2, it's Swift 5-only.\n\nTo be able to compile and run SwiftNIO and the integration tests, you need to\nhave a few prerequisites installed on your system.\n\n#### macOS\n\n- Xcode 11.4 or newer, Xcode 12 recommended.\n\n### Linux\n\n- Swift 5.7 or newer from [swift.org/download](https://swift.org/download/#releases).

Many people use it as their daily driver, but it may be unstable for some commands. Nu's design is subject to change as it matures.\n\n## Learning About Nu\n\nThe [Nushell book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/) is the primary source of Nushell documentation. You can find [a full list of Nu commands in the book](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/), and we have many examples of using Nu in our [cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/).\n\nWe're also active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn); come and chat with us!\n\n## Installation\n\nTo quickly install Nu:\n\n```bash\n# Linux and macOS\nbrew install nushell\n# Windows\nwinget install nushell\n```\n\nTo use `Nu` in GitHub Action, check [setup-nu](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-nu) for more detail.\n\nDetailed installation instructions can be found in the [installation chapter of the book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html). Nu is available via many package managers:\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nushell.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/nushell/versions)\n\nFor details about which platforms the Nushell team actively supports, see [our platform support policy](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe default configurations can be found at [sample_config](crates/nu-utils/src/default_files)\nwhich are the configuration files one gets when they startup Nushell for the first time.\n\nIt sets all of the default configuration to run Nushell.  From here one can\nthen customize this file for their specific needs.\n\nTo see where *config.nu* is located on your system simply type this command.\n\n```rust\n$nu.config-path\n```\n\nPlease see our [book](https://www.nushell.sh) for all of the Nushell documentation.\n\n\n## Philosophy\n\nNu draws inspiration from projects like PowerShell, functional programming languages, and modern CLI tools.\nRather than thinking of files and data as raw streams of text, Nu looks at each input as something with structure.\nFor example, when you list the contents of a directory what you get back is a table of rows, where each row represents an item in that directory.\nThese values can be piped through a series of steps, in a series of commands called a 'pipeline'.\n\n### Pipelines\n\nIn Unix, it's common to pipe between commands to split up a sophisticated command over multiple steps.\nNu takes this a step further and builds heavily on the idea of _pipelines_.\nAs in the Unix philosophy, Nu allows commands to output to stdout and read from stdin.\nAdditionally, commands can output structured data (you can think of this as a third kind of stream).\nCommands that work in the pipeline fit into one of three categories:\n\n-   Commands that produce a stream (e.g., `ls`)\n-   Commands that filter a stream (e.g., `where type == \"dir\"`)\n-   Commands that consume the output of the pipeline (e.g., `table`)\n\nCommands are separated by the pipe symbol (`|`) to denote a pipeline flowing left to right.\n\n```shell\nls | where type == \"dir\" | table\n# => ╭────┬──────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────╮\n# => │ #  │   name   │ type │  size   │   modified    │\n# => ├────┼──────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────┤\n# => │  0 │ .cargo   │ dir  │     0 B │ 9 minutes ago │\n# => │  1 │ assets   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  2 │ crates   │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  3 │ docker   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  4 │ docs     │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  5 │ images   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  6 │ pkg_mgrs │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  7 │ samples  │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  8 │ src      │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  9 │ target   │ dir  │     0 B │ a day ago     │\n# => │ 10 │ tests    │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │ 11 │ wix      │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => ╰────┴──────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────╯\n```\n\nBecause most of the time you'll want to see the output of a pipeline, `table` is assumed.\nWe could have also written the above:\n\n```shell\nls | where type == \"dir\"\n```\n\nBeing able to use the same commands and compose them differently is an important philosophy in Nu.\nFor example, we could use the built-in `ps` command to get a list of the running processes, using the same `where` as above.\n\n```shell\nps | where cpu > 0\n# => ╭───┬───────┬───────────┬───────┬───────────┬───────────╮\n# => │ # │  pid  │   name    │  cpu  │    mem    │  virtual  │\n# => ├───┼───────┼───────────┼───────┼───────────┼───────────┤\n# => │ 0 │  2240 │ Slack.exe │ 16.40 │ 178.3 MiB │ 232.6 MiB │\n# => │ 1 │ 16948 │ Slack.exe │ 16.32 │ 205.0 MiB │ 197.9 MiB │\n# => │ 2 │ 17700 │ nu.exe    │  3.77 │  26.1 MiB │   8.8 MiB │\n# => ╰───┴───────┴───────────┴───────┴───────────┴───────────╯\n```\n\n### Opening files\n\nNu can load file and URL contents as raw text or structured data (if it recognizes the format).\nFor example, you can load a .toml file as structured data and explore it:\n\n```shell\nopen Cargo.toml\n# => ╭──────────────────┬────────────────────╮\n# => │ bin              │ [table 1 row]      │\n# => │ dependencies     │ {record 25 fields} │\n# => │ dev-dependencies │ {record 8 fields}  │\n# => │ features         │ {record 10 fields} │\n# => │ package          │ {record 13 fields} │\n# => │ patch            │ {record 1 field}   │\n# => │ profile          │ {record 3 fields}  │\n# => │ target           │ {record 3 fields}  │\n# => │ workspace        │ {record 1 field}   │\n# => ╰──────────────────┴────────────────────╯\n```\n\nWe can pipe this into a command that gets the contents of one of the columns:\n\n```shell\nopen Cargo.toml | get package\n# => ╭───────────────┬────────────────────────────────────╮\n# => │ authors       │ [list 1 item]                      │\n# => │ default-run   │ nu                                 │\n# => │ description   │ A new type of shell                │\n# => │ documentation │ https://www.nushell.sh/book/       │\n# => │ edition       │ 2018                               │\n# => │ exclude       │ [list 1 item]                      │\n# => │ homepage      │ https://www.nushell.sh             │\n# => │ license       │ MIT                                │\n# => │ metadata      │ {record 1 field}                   │\n# => │ name          │ nu                                 │\n# => │ repository    │ https://github.com/nushell/nushell │\n# => │ rust-version  │ 1.60                               │\n# => │ version       │ 0.72.0                             │\n# => ╰───────────────┴────────────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\nAnd if needed we can drill down further:\n\n```shell\nopen Cargo.toml | get package.version\n# => 0.72.0\n```\n\n### Plugins\n\nNu supports plugins that offer additional functionality to the shell and follow the same structured data model that built-in commands use. There are a few examples in the `crates/nu_plugins_*` directories.\n\nPlugins are binaries that are available in your path and follow a `nu_plugin_*` naming convention.\nThese binaries interact with nu via a simple JSON-RPC protocol where the command identifies itself and passes along its configuration, making it available for use.\nIf the plugin is a filter, data streams to it one element at a time, and it can stream data back in return via stdin/stdout.\nIf the plugin is a sink, it is given the full vector of final data and is given free reign over stdin/stdout to use as it pleases.\n\nThe [awesome-nu repo](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu#plugins) lists a variety of nu-plugins while the [showcase repo](https://github.com/nushell/showcase) *shows* off informative blog posts that have been written about Nushell along with videos that highlight technical\ntopics that have been presented.\n\n## Goals\n\nNu adheres closely to a set of goals that make up its design philosophy. As features are added, they are checked against these goals.\n\n-   First and foremost, Nu is cross-platform. Commands and techniques should work across platforms and Nu has [first-class support for Windows, macOS, and Linux](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).\n\n-   Nu ensures compatibility with existing platform-specific executables.\n\n-   Nu's workflow and tools should have the usability expected of modern software in 2022 (and beyond).\n\n-   Nu views data as either structured or unstructured. It is a structured shell like PowerShell.\n\n-   Finally, Nu views data functionally. Rather than using mutation, pipelines act as a means to load, change, and save data without mutable state.\n\n## Officially Supported By\n\nPlease submit an issue or PR to be added to this list.\n\n-   [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)\n-   [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship)\n-   [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev)\n-   [Couchbase Shell](https://couchbase.sh)\n-   [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv)\n-   [atuin](https://github.com/ellie/atuin)\n-   [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/tree/master/clap_complete_nushell)\n-   [Dorothy](http://github.com/bevry/dorothy)\n-   [Direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/blob/master/docs/hook.md#nushell)\n-   [x-cmd](https://x-cmd.com/mod/nu)\n-   [vfox](https://github.com/version-fox/vfox)\n-   [Windmill](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/getting_started/scripts_quickstart/bash)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

      "readme": "# Immich-Go: Upload Your Photos to Your Immich Server\n\n**Immich-Go** is an open-source tool designed to streamline uploading large photo collections to your self-hosted Immich server.\n\n> ⚠️ This is an early version, not yet extensively tested<br>\n> ⚠️ Keep a backup copy of your files for safety<br>\n\n## 🌟 Key Features\n\n- **Simple Installation**: No NodeJS or Docker required\n- **Multiple Sources**: Upload from Google Photos Takeouts, iCloud, local folders, ZIP archives, and other Immich servers\n- **Large Collections**: Successfully handles 100,000+ photos\n- **Smart Management**: Duplicate detection, burst photo stacking, RAW+JPEG handling\n- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### 1. Install Immich-Go\nDownload the pre-built binary for your system from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/simulot/immich-go/releases).\n\n### 2. Basic Usage\n```bash\n# Upload photos from a local folder\nimmich-go upload from-folder --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key /path/to/your/photos\n\n# Upload Google Photos takeout\nimmich-go upload from-google-photos --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key /path/to/takeout-*.zip\n\n# Archive photos from Immich server\nimmich-go archive from-immich --server=http://your-ip:2283 --api-key=your-api-key --write-to-folder=/path/to/archive\n```\n\n### 3. Requirements\n- A running Immich server with API access\n- API key with appropriate permissions ([see full list](docs/installation.md#api-permissions))\n\n> ⚠️ **Breaking Change**: API keys must now include the `asset.copy` and `asset.delete` permissions in addition to previously required permissions. Please update your API keys accordingly.\n\n## 🙈 Skip System Files\n\n- Use `--ban-file` to exclude junk artifacts. Patterns ending with `/` apply to directories (for example, `--ban-file .Spotlight-V100/`), while patterns without the trailing slash apply to individual files (for example, `--ban-file .DS_Store`).\n- Immich-Go ships with sensible defaults that already skip common clutter such as `@eaDir/`, `@__thumb/`, `SYNOFILE_THUMB_*.*`, `Lightroom Catalog/`, `thumbnails/`, `.DS_Store`, `/._*`, `.Spotlight-V100/`, `.photostructure/`, and `Recently Deleted/`.\n- Add additional patterns as needed to keep uploads focused on real photos. See the [banned files reference](docs/technical.md#banned-files) for details.\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\n| Topic | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Installation](docs/installation.md) | Detailed installation instructions for all platforms |\n| [Commands](docs/commands/) | Complete command reference and options |\n| [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) | Configuration options and environment variables |\n| [Examples](docs/examples.md) | Common use cases and practical examples |\n| [Best Practices](docs/best-practices.md) | Tips for optimal performance and reliability |\n| [Technical Details](docs/technical.md) | File processing, metadata handling, and advanced features |\n| [Upload Commands Overview](docs/upload-commands-overview.md) | How `immich-go` processes files from different sources |\n| [Release Notes](docs/releases/) | Version history and release notes |\n\n## ✨ How immich-go Works\n\n`immich-go` offers a versatile set of commands to handle your photo and video uploads. Whether you're uploading from a simple folder, migrating from a Google Photos Takeout, or transferring assets between Immich servers, the tool provides intelligent features to preserve your metadata and organization.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the main upload commands:\n\n*   **`from-folder`**: The basic command for uploading from any local folder. It can create albums from your directory structure and read XMP sidecar files.\n*   **`from-google-photos`**: A powerful command to migrate from a Google Photos Takeout. It intelligently matches photos with their JSON metadata to preserve albums, descriptions, and locations.\n*   **`from-immich`**: A server-to-server migration tool that allows you to copy assets between two Immich instances with fine-grained filtering.\n*   **`from-picasa`**: A specialized version of `from-folder` that automatically reads `.picasa.ini` files to restore your Picasa album organization.\n*   **`from-icloud`**: Another specialized command that handles the complexity of an iCloud Photos takeout, correctly identifying creation dates and album structures from the included CSV files.\n\n### Leveraging Immich's Features\n\n`immich-go` is more than just an uploader; it intelligently interacts with the Immich server to preserve your library's structure:\n\n*   **Albums and Tags**: Automatically creates albums and tags on the server to match your source organization.\n*   **Stacking**: Groups related images, like RAW+JPEG pairs or photo bursts, into stacks.\n*   **Duplicate Detection**: Avoids re-uploading files that already exist on the server.\n*   **Efficient Uploads**: Can pause Immich's background jobs (like thumbnailing) during an upload for better performance.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of how each upload command works, please see the [Upload Commands Overview](docs/upload-commands-overview.md).\n\n## 🎯 Popular Use Cases\n\n- **Google Photos Migration**: [Complete guide](docs/best-practices.md#google-photos-migration)\n- **iCloud Import**: [Step-by-step instructions](docs/examples.md#icloud-import)\n- **Server Migration**: [Transfer between Immich instances](docs/examples.md#server-migration)\n- **Bulk Organization**: [Stacking and tagging strategies](docs/best-practices.md#organization-strategies)\n\n## 💡 Support the Project\n\n- [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/simulot)\n- [PayPal Donation](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=VGU2SQE88T2T4)\n\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

For a different one, please consider modifying the [official PKGBUILD](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/spotify-player) and rebuilding it manually. See [Audio Backends](#audio-backend) for a list of options.\n\n### Void Linux\n\nRun `xbps-install -S spotify-player` to install the application.\n\n### FreeBSD\n\nRun `pkg install spotify-player` to install the `spotify_player` binary from FreeBSD ports.\n\n### NetBSD\n\nUsing the package manager, run `pkgin install spotify-player` to install from the official repositories.\n\nBuilding from source,\n\n```\ncd /usr/pkgsrc/audio/spotify-player\nmake install\n```\n\n### NixOS\n\n[spotify-player](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=spotify-player&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=spotify-player) is available as a Nix package and can be installed via `nix-shell -p spotify-player` or as part of your system configuration.\n\nIf you want to build the source locally you can run `nix-shell` in the root of a checkout of the source code. The provided `shell.nix` file will install the build prerequisites.\n\n### Docker\n\n**Note**: [streaming](#streaming) feature is disabled when using the docker image.\n\nYou can download the binary image of the latest build from the `master` branch by running\n\n```\ndocker pull aome510/spotify_player:latest\n```\n\nthen run\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -it aome510/spotify_player:latest\n```\n\nto run the application.\n\nYou can also use your local config folder to configure the application or your local cache folder to store the application's cache data when running the docker image:\n\n```\ndocker run --rm \\\n-v $APP_CONFIG_FOLDER:/app/config/ \\\n-v $APP_CACHE_FOLDER:/app/cache/ \\\n-it aome510/spotify_player:latest\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### Spotify Connect\n\nTo enable a full [Spotify connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/) support, users will need to enable a _\"user-provided client integration\"_.\n\nThis integration can be done by following [this documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/) to register a Spotify app and then specifying the app's `client_id` in the [general configuration file](docs/config.md#general). **NOTE**: please make sure that you specify `http://127.0.0.1:8989/login` (default value of `login_redirect_uri` config option) in the **Redirect URI** section when creating the app.\n\nUpon running `spotify_player` with a user-provided `client_id`, user will be prompted to authenticate the app described earlier. **NOTE** that this prompt is different from the prompt to authenticate `spotify_player`. Upon accepting the authentication request, `spotify_player` will retrieve an access token of the app to finish setting up the integration.\n\nAfter the user-provided client is successfully integrated, press **D** (default shortcut for `SwitchDevice` command) to get the list of available devices, then press **enter** (default shortcut for `ChooseSelected` command) to connect to the selected device.\n\n### Streaming\n\n`spotify_player` supports streaming, which needs to be built/installed with `streaming` feature (**enabled** by default) **and** with an audio backend (`rodio-backend` by default). The streaming feature allows to `spotify_player` to play music directly from terminal.\n\nThe application uses [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library to create an integrated Spotify client while running. The integrated client will register a Spotify speaker device under the `spotify-player` name, which is accessible on the [Spotify connect](#spotify-connect) device list.\n\n#### Audio backend\n\n`spotify_player` uses [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio) as the default [audio backend](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends). List of available audio backends:\n\n- `alsa-backend`\n- `pulseaudio-backend`\n- `rodio-backend`\n- `portaudio-backend`\n- `jackaudio-backend`\n- `rodiojack-backend`\n- `sdl-backend`\n- `gstreamer-backend`\n\nUser can change the audio backend when building/installing the application by specifying the `--features` option. For example, to install `spotify_player` with `pulseaudio-backend`, run\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features pulseaudio-backend\n```\n\n**Note**:\n\n- needs to specify `--no-default-features` here because `rodio-backend` is one of the default features.\n- user will need to install additional dependencies depending on the selected audio backend. More details can be found in the [Librespot documentation](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies).\n\nThe `streaming` feature can be also disabled upon installing by running\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --no-default-features\n```\n\n### Media Control\n\nTo enable media control support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `media-control` feature (**enabled** by default) and set the `enable_media_control` config option to `true` in the [general configuration file](docs/config.md#media-control).\n\nMedia control support is implemented using [MPRIS DBus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) on Linux and OS window event listener on Windows and MacOS.\n\n### Image\n\nTo enable image rendering support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `image` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `image` feature included, run:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features image\n```\n\n`spotify_player` supports rendering image in a full resolution if the application is run on either [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Otherwise, the image will be displayed as [block characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements).\n\n`spotify_player` also supports rendering images with `sixel` behind `sixel` feature flag, which also enables `image` feature:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features sixel\n```\n\n**Notes**:\n\n- Not all terminals supported by [libsixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel) are supported by `spotify_player` as it relies on a [third-party library](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer) for image rendering. A possible list of supported terminals can be found in [here](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/blob/dc81f44a97727e04be0b000712e9233c92116ff8/src/printer/sixel.rs#L83-L95).\n- Images rendered by `sixel` can have a _weird_ scale. It's recommended to tweak the `cover_img_scale` config option to get the best result as the scaling works differently with different terminals and fonts.\n\nExamples of image rendering:\n\n- iTerm2:\n\n![iTerm2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/172966798-0aadc431-b0c3-4433-adf3-7526684fc2a0.png)\n\n- Kitty:\n\n![kitty](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/172967028-8cfb2daa-1642-499a-a5bf-8ed77f2b3fac.png)\n\n- Sixel (`foot` terminal, `cover_img_scale=1.8`):\n\n![sixel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/219880331-58ac1c30-bbb0-4c99-a6cc-e5b7c9c81455.png)\n\n- Others:\n\n![others](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/172967325-d2098037-e19e-440a-a38a-5b076253ecb1.png)\n\n#### Pixelate\n\nIf your terminal supports high-res images, but you like the pixelated look you can enable the `pixelate` feature, which also enables the `image` feature:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features pixelate\n```\n\nThe amount of pixels can be tweaked via the `cover_img_pixels` config option.\n\n| `cover_img_pixels` | `8`                                                                                                                 | `16`                                                                                                                  | `32`                                                                                                                  | `64`                                                                                                                  |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| example            | <img width=\"100\" alt=\"8x8\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4137aaea-ce28-4019-8cd5-2d14327e72e4\" /> | <img width=\"100\" alt=\"16x16\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ca94748-093a-468c-8fb3-1f5639666eb6\" /> | <img width=\"100\" alt=\"32x32\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5d0f2da-0439-47e4-91c9-3a2aa73ac90c\" /> | <img width=\"100\" alt=\"64x64\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d06ef731-38fa-424d-9672-313f56c193d0\" /> |\n\nTo temporarily disable the `pixelate` feature just set `cover_img_pixels` to a high value like `512`.\n\n### Notify\n\nTo enable desktop notification support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `notify` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `notify` feature included, run:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features notify\n```\n\n**Note**: the notification support in `MacOS` and `Windows` are quite restricted compared to `Linux`.\n\n### Mouse support\n\nCurrently, the only supported use case for mouse is to seek to a position of the current playback by left-clicking to such position in the playback's progress bar.\n\n### Daemon\n\nTo enable a [daemon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)>) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `daemon` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `daemon` feature included, run:\n\n```shell\ncargo install spotify_player --features daemon\n```\n\nYou can run the application as a daemon by specifying the `-d` or `--daemon` option: `spotify_player -d`.\n\n**Notes**:\n\n- `daemon` feature is not supported on Windows\n- `daemon` feature requires the `streaming` feature to be enabled and the application to be built with [an audio backend](#audio-backend)\n- because of the OS's restrictions, `daemon` feature doesn't work with the `media-control` feature on MacOS, which is **enabled by default**. In other words, if you want to use the `daemon` feature on MacOS, you must install the application with `media-control` feature **disabled**:\n\n  ```shell\n  cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features daemon,rodio-backend\n  ```\n\n### Fuzzy search\n\nTo enable [fuzzy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `fzf` feature (**disabled** by default).\n\n### CLI Commands\n\n`spotify_player` offers several CLI commands to interact with Spotify:\n\n- `get`: Get Spotify data (playlist/album/artist data, user's data, etc)\n- `playback`: Interact with the playback (start a playback, play-pause, next, etc)\n- `search`: Search spotify\n- `connect`: Connect to a Spotify device\n- `like`: Like currently playing track\n- `authenticate`: Authenticate the application\n- `playlist`: Playlist editing (new, delete, import, fork, etc)\n\nFor more details, run `spotify_player -h` or `spotify_player {command} -h`, in which `{command}` is a CLI command.\n\n**Notes**\n\n- When using the CLI for the first time, you'll need to run `spotify_player authenticate` to authenticate the application beforehand.\n- Under the hood, CLI command is handled by sending requests to a `spotify_player` client socket running on port `client_port`, [a general application configuration](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/docs/config.md#general) with a default value of `8080`. If there is no running application's instance, a new client will be created upon handling the CLI commands, which increases the latency of the command.\n\n#### Scripting\n\nThe `spotify_player` command-line interface makes scripting easy.\nWith the `search` subcommand, you can search Spotify and retrieve data in JSON format, enabling queries with tools like [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).\n\nHere’s an example of starting playback for the first track from a search query:\n\n```sh\nread -p \"Search spotify: \" query\nspotify_player playback start track --id $(spotify_player search \"$query\" | jq '.tracks.[0].id' | xargs)\n```\n\n## Commands\n\nTo go to the shortcut help page, press `?` or `C-h` (default shortcuts for `OpenCommandHelp` command).\n\n**Tips**:\n\n- you can search in the shortcut help page (and some other pages) using `Search` command\n- `RefreshPlayback` can be used to manually update the playback status.\n- `RestartIntegratedClient` is useful when user wants to switch to another audio device (headphone, earphone, etc) without restarting the application, as the integrated client will be re-initialized with the new device.\n\nList of supported commands:\n\n| Command                         | Description                                                                                        | Default

default shortcuts, please refer to the [keymaps section](docs/config.md#keymaps) in the configuration documentation.\n\n### Actions\n\nA general list of actions is available; however, not all Spotify items (track, album, artist, or playlist) implement each action. To get the list of available actions on an item, call the `ShowActionsOnCurrentTrack` command or the `ShowActionsOnSelectedItem` command, then press enter (default binding for the `ChooseSelected` command) to initiate the selected action. Some actions may not appear in the popup but can be bound to a shortcut.\n\nList of available actions:\n\n- `GoToArtist`\n- `GoToAlbum`\n- `GoToRadio`\n- `AddToLibrary`\n- `AddToPlaylist`\n- `AddToQueue`\n- `AddToLiked`\n- `DeleteFromLiked`\n- `DeleteFromLibrary`\n- `DeleteFromPlaylist`\n- `ShowActionsOnAlbum`\n- `ShowActionsOnArtist`\n- `ShowActionsOnShow`\n- `ToggleLiked`\n- `CopyLink`\n- `Follow`\n- `Unfollow`\n\nThese actions can also be bound to a shortcut. To add new shortcuts, please refer to the [actions section](docs/config.md#actions) in the configuration documentation.\n\n### Search Page\n\nWhen first entering the search page, the application focuses on the search input. User can then input text, delete one character backward using `backspace`, or search the text using `enter`.\n\nTo move the focus from the search input to the other windows such as track results, album results, etc, use `FocusNextWindow` or `FocusPreviousWindow`.\n\n## Configurations\n\nBy default, `spotify_player` will look into `$HOME/.config/spotify-player` for application's configuration files. This can be changed by either specifying `-c <FOLDER_PATH>` or `--config-folder <FOLDER_PATH>` option.\n\nIf an application configuration file is not found, one will be created with default values.\n\nPlease refer to [the configuration documentation](docs/config.md) for more details on the configuration options.\n\n## Caches\n\nBy default, `spotify_player` will look into `$HOME/.cache/spotify-player` for application's cache files, which include log files, Spotify's authorization credentials, audio cache files, etc. This can be changed by either specifying `-C <FOLDER_PATH>` or `--cache-folder <FOLDER_PATH>` option.\n\n### Logging\n\nThe application stores logs inside the `$APP_CACHE_FOLDER/spotify-player-*.log` file. For debugging or submitting an issue, user can also refer to the backtrace file in `$APP_CACHE_FOLDER/spotify-player-*.backtrace`, which includes the application's backtrace in case of panics/unexpected errors.\n\n`spotify_player` uses `RUST_LOG` environment variable to define the application's [logging level](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.14/log/enum.Level.html). `RUST_LOG` is default to be `spotify_player=INFO`, which only shows the application's logs.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\n`spotify_player` is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and is built on top of awesome libraries such as [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui), [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify), [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot), and [many more](spotify_player/Cargo.toml). It's highly inspired by [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui) and [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot).\n",

The service supports dozens of continuous integration services, package registries, distributions, app stores, social networks, code coverage services, and code analysis services. Every month it serves over 1.6 billion images and is used by some of the world's most popular open-source projects, [VS Code][vscode], [Vue.js][vue] and [Bootstrap][bootstrap] to name a few.\n\n[vscode]: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode\n[vue]: https://github.com/vuejs/vue\n[bootstrap]: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap\n\nThis repo hosts:\n\n- The [Shields.io][shields.io] frontend and server code\n- An [NPM library for generating badges][badge-maker]\n  - [documentation][badge-maker-docs]\n  - [changelog][badge-maker-changelog]\n- The [badge design specification][badge-spec]\n\n[shields.io]: https://shields.io/\n[badge-maker]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/badge-maker\n[badge-spec]: https://github.com/badges/shields/tree/master/spec\n[badge-maker-docs]: https://github.com/badges/shields/tree/master/badge-maker/README.md\n[badge-maker-changelog]: https://github.com/badges/shields/tree/master/badge-maker/CHANGELOG.md\n\n## Examples\n\n- code coverage percentage: ![coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-80%25-yellowgreen)\n- stable release version: ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.2.3-blue)\n- package manager release: ![gem](https://img.shields.io/badge/gem-2.2.0-blue)\n- status of third-party dependencies: ![dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-out%20of%20date-orange)\n- static code analysis grade: ![codacy](https://img.shields.io/badge/codacy-B-green)\n- [SemVer](https://semver.org/) version observance: ![semver](https://img.shields.io/badge/semver-2.0.0-blue)\n- amount of [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/) donations per week: ![receives](https://img.shields.io/badge/receives-2.00%20USD%2Fweek-yellow)\n- Python package downloads: ![downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-13k%2Fmonth-brightgreen)\n- Chrome Web Store extension rating: ![rating](https://img.shields.io/badge/rating-★★★★☆-brightgreen)\n- Uptime Robot uptime percentage: ![uptime](https://img.shields.io/badge/uptime-100%25-brightgreen)\n\n[Make your own badges!][custom badges] (Quick example: `https://img.shields.io/badge/left-right-f39f37`)\n\n[custom badges]: https://img.shields.io/badges/static-badge\n\n### Quickstart\n\nBrowse a [complete list of badges][shields.io] and locate a particular badge by using the search bar or by browsing the categories. Click on the badge to fill in required data elements for that badge type (like your username or repo) and optionally customize (label, colors etc.). And it's ready for use!\n\nUse the button at the bottom to copy your badge url or snippet, which can then be added to places like your GitHub readme files or other web pages.\n\n## Contributing\n\nShields is a community project. We invite your participation through issues and pull requests! You can peruse the [contributing guidelines][contributing].\n\nWhen adding or changing a service [please add tests][service-tests].\n\nThis project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you're new to the project, maybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them.\n\nYou can read a [tutorial on how to add a badge][tutorial].\n\n[![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/badges/shields/good%20first%20issue)](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\n\nIf you intend on reporting or contributing a fix related to security vulnerabilities, please first refer to our [security policy][security].\n\n[service-tests]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/service-tests.md\n[tutorial]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md\n[contributing]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[security]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/SECURITY.md\n\n## Development\n\n[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/badges/shields?quickstart=1)\n\n1. Install Node 22. You can use the [package manager][] of your choice.\n2. Clone this repository.\n3. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.\n4. Run `npm start` to start the badge server and the frontend dev server.\n5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the frontend.\n\nWhen server source files change, the badge server should automatically restart itself (using [nodemon][]). When the frontend files change, the frontend dev server (`docusaurus start`) should also automatically reload. However the badge definitions are built only before the server first starts. To regenerate those, either run `npm run prestart` or manually restart the server.\n\nTo debug a badge from the command line, run `npm run badge -- /npm/v/nock`. It also works with full URLs like `npm run badge -- https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nock`.\n\nUse `npm run debug:server` to start server in debug mode. [This recipe][nodemon debug] shows how to debug Node.js application in [VS Code][].\n\n[Snapshot tests][] ensure we don't inadvertently make changes that affect the SVG or JSON output. When deliberately changing the output, run `SNAPSHOT_DRY=1 npm run test:package` to preview changes to the saved snapshots, and `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 npm run test:package` to update them.\n\nThe server can be configured to use [Sentry][] ([configuration][sentry configuration]) and [Prometheus][] ([configuration][prometheus configuration]).\n\nOur [full test suite][full test suite] as well as [code coverage][code coverage] are run on a daily basis.\n\n[package manager]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\n[snapshot tests]: https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/snapshot-testing/\n[prometheus]: https://prometheus.io/\n[prometheus configuration]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md#prometheus\n[sentry]: https://sentry.io/\n[sentry configuration]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md#sentry\n[nodemon]: https://nodemon.io/\n[nodemon debug]: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/nodemon\n[vs code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\n[full test suite]: https://github.com/badges/shields/actions/workflows/daily-tests.yml\n[code coverage]: https://coveralls.io/github/badges/shields\n\n## Hosting your own server\n\nThere is documentation about [hosting your own server][self-hosting].\n\n[self-hosting]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md\n\n## Related projects\n\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n\nStatus badges are used widely across open-source and private software projects. Academics have studied the \"signal\" badges provide about software project quality. There are many existing libraries for rendering these badges, and alternatives to the hosted Shields badge service. [awesome-badges][] is a curated collection of such resources. [Contributions][contributing to awesome-badges] may be considered there. (The presence of a project in that collection should not be interpreted as an endorsement nor promotion from the Shields project)\n\n[awesome-badges]: https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges\n[contributing to awesome-badges]: https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\n## History\n\nb.adge.me was the original website for this service. Heroku back then had a thing which made it hard to use a toplevel domain with it, hence the odd domain. It used code developed in 2013 from a library called [gh-badges][old-gh-badges], both developed by [Thaddée Tyl][espadrine]. The project merged with shields.io by making it use the b.adge.me code and closed b.adge.me.\n\nThe original badge specification was developed in 2013 by [Olivier Lacan][olivierlacan]. It was inspired by the Travis CI and similar badges (there were a lot fewer, back then). In 2014 Thaddée Tyl redesigned it with help from a Travis CI employee and convinced everyone to switch to it. The old design is what today is called the plastic style; the new one is the flat style.\n\nYou can read more about [the project's inception][thread], [the motivation of the SVG badge specification][motivation], and [the specification itself][spec].\n\n[olivierlacan]: https://github.com/olivierlacan\n[espadrine]: https://github.com/espadrine\n[old-gh-badges]: https://github.com/badges/gh-badges\n[motivation]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/spec/motivation.md\n[spec]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/spec/SPECIFICATION.md\n[thread]: https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/150\n\n## Project leaders\n\nMaintainers:\n\n- [calebcartwright](https://github.com/calebcartwright)\n- [jNullj](https://github.com/jnullj)\n- [LitoMore](https://github.com/LitoMore)\n- [paulmelnikow](https://github.com/paulmelnikow)\n- [PyvesB](https://github.com/PyvesB)\n\nAlumni:\n\n- [chris48s](https://github.com/chris48s)\n- [Daniel15](https://github.com/Daniel15)\n- [espadrine](https://github.com/espadrine)\n- [olivierlacan](https://github.com/olivierlacan)\n- [platan](https://github.com/platan)\n- [RedSparr0w](https://github.com/RedSparr0w)\n\n## License\n\nAll assets and code are under the [CC0 LICENSE](LICENSE) and in the public domain unless specified otherwise.\n\n## Community\n\nThanks to the people and companies who donate money, services or time to keep the project running.

It is free and open-source forever!\n\n## WARNING\n\nBevy is still in the early stages of development. Important features are missing. Documentation is sparse. A new version of Bevy containing breaking changes to the API is released [approximately once every 3 months](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-6/#the-train-release-schedule). We provide [migration guides](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/), but we can't guarantee migrations will always be easy. Use only if you are willing to work in this environment.\n\n**MSRV:** Bevy relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.\nAs a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally close to \"the latest stable release\" of Rust.\n\n## Design Goals\n\n* **Capable**: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set\n* **Simple**: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users\n* **Data Focused**: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm\n* **Modular**: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like\n* **Fast**: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel\n* **Productive**: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun\n\n## About\n\n* **[Features](https://bevy.org):** A quick overview of Bevy's features.\n* **[News](https://bevy.org/news/)**: A development blog that covers our progress, plans and shiny new features.\n\n## Docs\n\n* **[Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction):** Bevy's official Quick Start Guide. The best place to start learning Bevy.\n* **[Bevy Rust API Docs](https://docs.rs/bevy):** Bevy's Rust API docs, which are automatically generated from the doc comments in this repo.\n* **[Official Examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples):** Bevy's dedicated, runnable examples, which are great for digging into specific concepts.\n* **[Community-Made Learning Resources](https://bevy.org/assets/#learning)**: More tutorials, documentation, and examples made by the Bevy community.\n\n## Community\n\nBefore contributing or participating in discussions with the community, you should familiarize yourself with our [**Code of Conduct**](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n* **[Discord](https://discord.gg/bevy):** Bevy's official discord server.\n* **[Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/bevy):** Bevy's official subreddit.\n* **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions):** The best place for questions about Bevy, answered right here!\n* **[Bevy Assets](https://bevy.org/assets/):** A collection of awesome Bevy projects, tools, plugins and learning materials.\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to help build Bevy, check out the **[Contributor's Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/contribute/introduction)**.\nFor simple problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues) or\n[PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pulls) and tackle it yourself!\n\nFor more complex architecture decisions and experimental mad science, please open an [RFC](https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs) (Request For Comments) so we can brainstorm together effectively!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWe recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/introduction) for a brief introduction.\n\nFollow the [Setup guide](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup) to ensure your development environment is set up correctly.\nOnce set up, you can quickly try out the [examples](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples) by cloning this repo and running the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Switch to the correct version (latest release, default is main development branch)\ngit checkout latest\n# Runs the \"breakout\" example\ncargo run --example breakout\n```\n\nTo draw a window with standard functionality enabled, use:\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .run();\n}\n```\n\n### Fast Compiles\n\nBevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for really fast iterative compiles, you should enable the \"fast compiles\" setup by [following the instructions here](https://bevy.org/learn/quick-start/getting-started/setup).\n\n## [Bevy Cargo Features][cargo_features]\n\nThis [list][cargo_features] outlines the different cargo features supported by Bevy. These allow you to customize the Bevy feature set for your use-case.\n\n[cargo_features]: docs/cargo_features.md\n\n## Thanks\n\nBevy is the result of the hard work of many people. A huge thanks to all Bevy contributors, the many open source projects that have come before us, the [Rust gamedev ecosystem](https://arewegameyet.rs/), and the many libraries we build on.\n\nA huge thanks to Bevy's [generous sponsors](https://bevy.org). Bevy will always be free and open source, but it isn't free to make. Please consider [sponsoring our work](https://bevy.org/donate/) if you like what we're building.\n\n<!-- This next line need to stay exactly as is.

Each stable release is supported for\none year with patches. See the next upcoming versions in the [Release\nRegistry](https://github.com/paritytech/release-registry/) and more docs in [RELEASE.md](./docs/RELEASE.md).\n\nYou can use [`psvm`](https://github.com/paritytech/psvm) to update all dependencies to a specific\nversion without needing to manually select the correct version for each crate.\n\n## 🛠️ Tooling\n\n[Polkadot SDK Version Manager](https://github.com/paritytech/psvm):\nA simple tool to manage and update the Polkadot SDK dependencies in any Cargo.toml file.\nIt will automatically update the Polkadot SDK dependencies to their correct crates.io version.\n\n## 🔐 Security\n\nThe security policy and procedures can be found in\n[docs/contributor/SECURITY.md](./docs/contributor/SECURITY.md).\n\n## 🤍 Contributing & Code of Conduct\n\nEnsure you follow our [contribution guidelines](./docs/contributor/CONTRIBUTING.md). In every\ninteraction and contribution, this project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of\nConduct](./docs/contributor/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### 👾 Ready to Contribute?\n\nTake a look at the issues labeled with [`mentor`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/labels/C1-mentor)\n(or alternatively [this](https://mentor.tasty.limo/) page, created by one of the maintainers) label to get started!\nWe always recognize valuable contributions by proposing an on-chain tip to the Polkadot network as a token of our\nappreciation.\n\n## Polkadot Fellowship\n\nDevelopment in this repo usually goes hand in hand with the `fellowship` organization. In short,\nthis repository provides all the SDK pieces needed to build both Polkadot and its parachains. But,\nthe actual Polkadot runtime lives in the `fellowship/runtimes` repository. Read more about the\nfellowship, this separation, the RFC process\n[here](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/dashboard/).\n\n## History\n\nThis repository is the amalgamation of 3 separate repositories that used to make up Polkadot SDK,\nnamely Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus.

Download and install Obtainium from [here](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases) (use the file named `app-release.apk`)\n2. Open Obtainium and click 'Add App'\n3. Type `https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar` into the 'App Source URL' section\n4. Click 'Add'\n5. Click 'Install'\n\nIf you wish, you can also simply install the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/releases) page.\n\nKeep in mind that you will not recieve automatic updates when installing via the APK.\n\n---\n### Linux\n\nThe recommended format for using Azahar on Linux is the Flatpak available on Flathub:\n\n<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/org.azahar_emu.Azahar'><img width='180' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://dl.flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png'/></a>\n\nAzahar is also available as an AppImage on the [Releases](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/releases) page.\n\nIf you are unsure of which variant to use, we recommend using the default `azahar.AppImage`. This is because of upstream issues in the Wayland ecosystem which may cause problems when running the emulator (e.g. [#1162](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/issues/1162)).\n\nUnless you explicitly require native Wayland support (e.g. you are running a system with no Xwayland), the non-Wayland variant is recommended.\n\nIf you are using the Flatpak and run into issues with Wayland, you can disable Wayland support for the Azahar Flatpak using [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/en/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal).\n\n# Build instructions\n\nPlease refer this repository's [wiki](https://github.com/azahar-emu/azahar/wiki/Building-From-Source) for build instructions\n\n# How can I contribute?\n\n### Pull requests\n\nIf you want to implement a change and have the technical capability to do so, we would be happy to accept your contributions.\n\nIf you are contributing a new feature, it is highly suggested that you first make a Feature Request issue to discuss the addition before writing any code. This is to ensure that your time isn't wasted working on a feature which isn't deemed appropriate for the project.\n\nAfter creating a pull request, please don't repeatedly merge `master` into your branch. A maintainer will update the branch for you if/ when it is appropriate to do so.\n\n### Language translations\n\nAdditionally, we are accepting language translations on [Transifex](https://app.transifex.com/azahar/azahar).

      "readme": "# 👷 `workerd`, Cloudflare's JavaScript/Wasm Runtime\n\n![Banner](/docs/assets/banner.png)\n\n`workerd` (pronounced: \"worker-dee\") is a JavaScript / Wasm server runtime based on the same code that powers [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev).\n\nYou might use it:\n\n* **As an application server**, to self-host applications designed for Cloudflare Workers.\n* **As a development tool**, to develop and test such code locally.\n* **As a programmable HTTP proxy** (forward or reverse), to efficiently intercept, modify, and\n  route network requests.\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Design Principles\n\n* **Server-first:** Designed for servers, not CLIs nor GUIs.\n\n* **Standard-based:** Built-in APIs are based on web platform standards, such as `fetch()`.\n\n* **Nanoservices:** Split your application into components that are decoupled and independently-deployable like microservices, but with performance of a local function call. When one nanoservice calls another, the callee runs in the same thread and process.\n\n* **Homogeneous deployment:** Instead of deploying different microservices to different machines in your cluster, deploy all your nanoservices to every machine in the cluster, making load balancing much easier.\n\n* **Capability bindings:** `workerd` configuration uses capabilities instead of global namespaces to connect nanoservices to each other and external resources. The result is code that is more composable -- and immune to SSRF attacks.\n\n* **Always backwards compatible:** Updating `workerd` to a newer version will never break your JavaScript code. `workerd`'s version number is simply a date, corresponding to the maximum [\"compatibility date\"](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/compatibility-dates/) supported by that version. You can always configure your worker to a past date, and `workerd` will emulate the API as it existed on that date.\n\n[Read the blog post to learn more about these principles.](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workerd-open-source-workers-runtime/)\n\n### WARNING: This is a beta. Work in progress\n\nAlthough most of `workerd`'s code has been used in Cloudflare Workers for years, the `workerd` configuration format and top-level server code is brand new. We don't yet have much experience running this in production. As such, there will be rough edges, maybe even a few ridiculous bugs. Deploy to production at your own risk (but please tell us what goes wrong!).\n\nThe config format may change in backwards-incompatible ways before `workerd` leaves beta, but should remain stable after that.\n\nA few caveats:\n\n* **General error logging** is awkward. Traditionally we have separated error logs into \"application errors\" (e.g. a Worker threw an exception from JavaScript) and \"internal errors\" (bugs in the implementation which the Workers team should address). We then sent these errors to completely different places. In the `workerd` world, the server admin wants to see both of these, so logging has become entirely different and, at the moment, is a bit ugly. For now, it may help to run `workerd` with the `--verbose` flag, which causes application errors to be written to standard error in the same way that internal errors are (but may also produce more noise). We'll be working on making this better out-of-the-box.\n* **Binary packages** are only available via npm, not as distro packages. This works well for testing with Miniflare, but is awkward for a production server that doesn't actually use Node at all.\n* **Multi-threading** is not implemented. `workerd` runs in a single-threaded event loop. For now, to utilize multiple cores, we suggest running multiple instances of `workerd` and balancing load across them. We will likely add some built-in functionality for this in the near future.\n* **Performance tuning** has not been done yet, and there is low-hanging fruit here. `workerd` performs decently as-is, but not spectacularly. Experiments suggest we can roughly double performance on a \"hello world\" load test with some tuning of compiler optimization flags and memory allocators.\n* **Durable Objects** currently always run on the same machine that requested them, using local disk storage. This is sufficient for testing and small services that fit on a single machine. In scalable production, though, you would presumably want Durable Objects to be distributed across many machines, always choosing the same machine for the same object.\n* **Parameterized workers** are not implemented yet. This is a new feature specified in the config schema, which doesn't have any precedent on Cloudflare.\n* **Tests** for most APIs are conspicuously missing. This is because the testing harness we have used for the past five years is deeply tied to the internal version of the codebase. Ideally, we need to translate those tests into the new `workerd test` format and move them to this repo; this is an ongoing effort. For the time being, we will be counting on the internal tests to catch bugs. We understand this is not ideal for external contributors trying to test their changes.\n* **Documentation** is growing quickly but is definitely still a work in progress.\n\n### WARNING: `workerd` is not a hardened sandbox\n\n`workerd` tries to isolate each Worker so that it can only access the resources it is configured to access. However, `workerd` on its own does not contain suitable defense-in-depth against the possibility of implementation bugs. When using `workerd` to run possibly-malicious code, you must run it inside an appropriate secure sandbox, such as a virtual machine. The Cloudflare Workers hosting service in particular [uses many additional layers of defense-in-depth](https://blog.cloudflare.com/mitigating-spectre-and-other-security-threats-the-cloudflare-workers-security-model/).\n\nWith that said, if you discover a bug that allows malicious code to break out of `workerd`, please submit it to [Cloudflare's bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/cloudflare?type=team) for a reward.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Supported Platforms\n\nIn theory, `workerd` should work on any POSIX system that is supported by V8 and Windows.\n\nIn practice, `workerd` is tested on:\n\n* Linux and macOS (x86-64 and arm64 architectures)\n* Windows (x86-64 architecture)\n\nOn other platforms, you may have to do tinkering to make things work.\n\n### Building `workerd`\n\nTo build `workerd`, you need:\n\n* Bazel\n  * If you use [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) (recommended), it will automatically download and use the right version of Bazel for building workerd.\n* On Linux:\n  * We use the clang/LLVM toolchain to build workerd and support version 19 and higher. Earlier versions of clang may still work, but are not officially supported.\n  * Clang 19+ (e.g. package `clang-19` on Debian Bookworm). If clang is installed as `clang-<version>` please create a symlink to it in your PATH named `clang`, or use `--action_env=CC=clang-<version>` on `bazel` command lines to specify the compiler name.\n\n  * libc++ 19+ (e.g. packages `libc++-19-dev` and `libc++abi-19-dev`)\n  * LLD 19+ (e.g. package `lld-19`).\n  * `python3`, `python3-distutils`, and `tcl8.6`\n* On macOS:\n  * Xcode 16.3 installation (available on macOS 15 and higher). Building with just the Xcode Command Line Tools is not being tested, but should work too.\n  * Homebrew installed `tcl-tk` package (provides Tcl 8.6)\n* On Windows:\n  * Install [App Installer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget)\n    from the Microsoft Store for the `winget` package manager and then run\n    [install-deps.bat](tools/windows/install-deps.bat) from an administrator prompt to install\n    bazelisk, LLVM, and other dependencies required to build workerd on Windows.\n  * Add `startup --output_user_root=C:/tmp` to the `.bazelrc` file in your user directory.\n  * When developing at the command-line, run [bazel-env.bat](tools/windows/bazel-env.bat) in your shell first\n    to select tools and Windows SDK versions before running bazel.\n\nYou may then build `workerd` at the command-line with:\n\n```sh\nbazel build //src/workerd/server:workerd\n```\n\nYou can also build from within Visual Studio Code using the instructions in [docs/vscode.md](docs/vscode.md).\n\nThe compiled binary will be located at `bazel-bin/src/workerd/server/workerd`.\n\nIf you run a Bazel build before you've installed some dependencies (like clang or libc++), and then you install the dependencies, you must resync locally cached toolchains, or clean Bazel's cache, otherwise you might get strange errors:\n\n```sh\nbazel fetch --configure --force\n```\n\nIf that fails, you can try:\n\n```sh\nbazel clean --expunge\n```\n\nThe cache will now be cleaned and you can try building again.\n\nIf you have a fairly recent clang packages installed you can build a more performant release\nversion of workerd:\n\n```sh\nbazel build --config=thin-lto //src/workerd/server:workerd\n```\n\n### Configuring `workerd`\n\n`workerd` is configured using a config file written in Cap'n Proto text format.\n\nA simple \"Hello World!\" config file might look like:\n\n```capnp\nusing Workerd = import \"/workerd/workerd.capnp\";\n\nconst config :Workerd.Config = (\n  services = [\n    (name = \"main\", worker = .mainWorker),\n  ],\n\n  sockets = [\n    # Serve HTTP on port 8080.\n    ( name = \"http\",\n      address = \"*:8080\",\n      http = (),\n      service = \"main\"\n    ),\n  ]\n);\n\nconst mainWorker :Workerd.Worker = (\n  serviceWorkerScript = embed \"hello.js\",\n  compatibilityDate = \"2023-02-28\",\n  # Learn more about compatibility dates at:\n  # https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/compatibility-dates/\n);\n```\n\nWhere `hello.js` contains:\n\n```javascript\naddEventListener(\"fetch\", event => {\n  event.respondWith(new Response(\"Hello World\"));\n});\n```\n\n[Complete reference documentation is provided by the comments in workerd.capnp.](src/workerd/server/workerd.capnp)\n\n[There is also a library of sample config files.](samples)\n\n(TODO: Provide a more extended tutorial.)\n\n### Running `workerd`\n\nTo serve your config, do:\n\n`workerd serve my-config.capnp`\n\nFor more details about command-line usage, use `workerd --help`.\n\nPrebuilt binaries are distributed via `npm`. Run `npx workerd ...` to use these. If you're running a prebuilt binary, you'll need to make sure your system has the right dependencies installed:\n\n* On Linux:\n  * glibc 2.35 or higher (already included on e.g. Ubuntu 22.04, Debian Bookworm)\n* On macOS:\n  * macOS 13.5 or higher\n  * The Xcode command line tools, which can be installed with `xcode-select --install`\n* x86_64 CPU with at least SSE4.2 and CLMUL ISA extensions, or arm64 CPU with CRC extension (enabled by default under armv8.1-a). These extensions are supported by all recent x86 and arm64 CPUs.\n\n### Local Worker development with `wrangler`\n\nYou can use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) (v3.0 or greater) to develop Cloudflare Workers locally, using `workerd`. First, run the following command to configure Miniflare to use this build of `workerd`.\n\n```\n$ export MINIFLARE_WORKERD_PATH=\"<WORKERD_REPO_DIR>/bazel-bin/src/workerd/server/workerd\"\n```\n\nThen, run:\n\n`wrangler dev`\n\n### Serving in production\n\n`workerd` is designed to be unopinionated about how it runs.\n\nOne good way to manage `workerd` in production is using `systemd`. Particularly useful is `systemd`'s ability to open privileged sockets on `workerd`'s behalf while running the service itself under an unprivileged user account. To help with this, `workerd` supports inheriting sockets from the parent process using the `--socket-fd` flag.\n\nHere's an example system service file, assuming your config defines two sockets named `http` and `https`:\n\n```sh\n# /etc/systemd/system/workerd.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=workerd runtime\nAfter=local-fs.target remote-fs.target network-online.target\nRequires=local-fs.target remote-fs.target workerd.socket\nWants=network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nType=exec\nExecStart=/usr/bin/workerd serve /etc/workerd/config.capnp --socket-fd http=3 --socket-fd https=4\nSockets=workerd.socket\n\n# If workerd crashes, restart it.\nRestart=always\n\n# Run under an unprivileged user account.\nUser=nobody\nGroup=nogroup\n\n# Hardening measure: Do not allow workerd to run suid-root programs.\nNoNewPrivileges=true\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nAnd corresponding sockets file:\n\n```sh\n# /etc/systemd/system/workerd.socket\n[Unit]\nDescription=sockets for workerd\nPartOf=workerd.service\n\n[Socket]\nListenStream=0.0.0.0:80\nListenStream=0.0.0.0:443\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=sockets.target\n```\n\n(TODO: Fully explain how to get systemd to recognize these files and start the service.)\n",

      "readme": "# Shizuku\n\n## Background\n\nWhen developing apps that requires root, the most common method is to run some commands in the su shell. For example, there is an app that uses the `pm enable/disable` command to enable/disable components.\n\nThis method has very big disadvantages:\n\n1. **Extremely slow** (Multiple process creation)\n2. Needs to process texts (**Super unreliable**)\n3. The possibility is limited to available commands\n4. Even if ADB has sufficient permissions, the app requires root privileges to run\n\nShizuku uses a completely different way. See detailed description below.\n\n## User guide & Download\n\n<https://shizuku.rikka.app/>\n\n## How does Shizuku work?\n\nFirst, we need to talk about how app use system APIs. For example, if the app wants to get installed apps, we all know we should use `PackageManager#getInstalledPackages()`. This is actually an interprocess communication (IPC) process of the app process and system server process, just the Android framework did the inner works for us.\n\nAndroid uses `binder` to do this type of IPC. `Binder` allows the server-side to learn the uid and pid of the client-side, so that the system server can check if the app has the permission to do the operation.\n\nUsually, if there is a \"manager\" (e.g., `PackageManager`) for apps to use, there should be a \"service\" (e.g., `PackageManagerService`) in the system server process. We can simply think if the app holds the `binder` of the \"service\", it can communicate with the \"service\". The app process will receive binders of system services on start.\n\nShizuku guides users to run a process, Shizuku server, with root or ADB first. When the app starts, the `binder` to Shizuku server will also be sent to the app.\n\nThe most important feature Shizuku provides is something like be a middle man to receive requests from the app, sent them to the system server, and send back the results. You can see the `transactRemote` method in `rikka.shizuku.server.ShizukuService` class, and `moe.shizuku.api.ShizukuBinderWrapper` class for the detail.\n\nSo, we reached our goal, to use system APIs with higher permission. And to the app, it is almost identical to the use of system APIs directly.\n\n## Developer guide\n\n### API & sample\n\nhttps://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku-API\n\n### Migrating from pre-v11\n\n> Existing applications still works, of course.\n\nhttps://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku-API#migration-guide-for-existing-applications-use-shizuku-pre-v11\n\n### Attention\n\n1. ADB permissions are limited\n\n   ADB has limited permissions and different on various system versions. You can see permissions granted to ADB [here](https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/packages/Shell/AndroidManifest.xml).\n\n   Before calling the API, you can use `ShizukuService#getUid` to check if Shizuku is running user ADB, or use `ShizukuService#checkPermission` to check if the server has sufficient permissions.\n\n2. Hidden API limitation from Android 9\n\n   As of Android 9, the usage of the hidden APIs is limited for normal apps. Please use other methods (such as <https://github.com/LSPosed/AndroidHiddenApiBypass>).\n\n3. Android 8.0 & ADB\n\n   At present, the way Shizuku service gets the app process is to combine `IActivityManager#registerProcessObserver` and `IActivityManager#registerUidObserver` (26+) to ensure that the app process will be sent when the app starts. However, on API 26, ADB lacks permissions to use `registerUidObserver`, so if you need to use Shizuku in a process that might not be started by an Activity, it is recommended to trigger the send binder by starting a transparent activity.\n\n4. Direct use of `transactRemote` requires attention\n\n   * The API may be different under different Android versions, please be sure to check it carefully. Also, the `android.app.IActivityManager` has the aidl form in API 26 and later, and `android.app.IActivityManager$Stub` exists only on API 26.\n\n   * `SystemServiceHelper.getTransactionCode` may not get the correct transaction code, such as `android.content.pm.IPackageManager$Stub.TRANSACTION_getInstalledPackages` does not exist on API 25 and there is `android.content.pm.IPackageManager$Stub.TRANSACTION_getInstalledPackages_47` (this situation has been dealt with, but it is not excluded that there may be other circumstances). This problem is not encountered with the `ShizukuBinderWrapper` method.\n\n## Developing Shizuku itself\n\n### Build\n\n- Clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules`\n- Run gradle task `:manager:assembleDebug` or `:manager:assembleRelease`\n\nThe `:manager:assembleDebug` task generates a debuggable server. You can attach a debugger to `shizuku_server` to debug the server. Be aware that, in Android Studio, \"Run/Debug configurations\" - \"Always install with package manager\" should be checked, so that the server will use the latest code.\n\n## License\n\nAll code files in this project are licensed under Apache 2.0\n\nUnder Apache 2.0 section 6, specifically:\n\n* You are **FORBIDDEN** to use `manager/src/main/res/mipmap*/ic_launcher*.png` image files, unless for displaying Shizuku itself.\n\n* You are **FORBIDDEN** to use `Shizuku` as app name or use `moe.shizuku.privileged.api` as application id or declare `moe.shizuku.manager.permission.*` permission.\n",

The executable's major version will match Express's:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g express-generator@4\n```\n\n  Create the app:\n\n```bash\nexpress /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo\n```\n\n  Install dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n  Start the server:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\n  View the website at: http://localhost:3000\n\n## Philosophy\n\n  The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making\n  it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public\n  HTTP APIs.\n\n  Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over\n  14 template engines via [@ladjs/consolidate](https://github.com/ladjs/consolidate),\n  you can quickly craft your perfect framework.\n\n## Examples\n\n  To view the examples, clone the Express repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1 && cd express\n```\n\n  Then install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n  Then run whichever example you want:\n\n```bash\nnode examples/content-negotiation\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe Express.js project welcomes all constructive contributions. Contributions take many forms,\nfrom code for bug fixes and enhancements, to additions and fixes to documentation, additional\ntests, triaging incoming pull requests and issues, and more!\n\nSee the [Contributing Guide] for more technical details on contributing.\n\n### Security Issues\n\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in Express, please see [Security Policies and Procedures](SECURITY.md).\n\n### Running Tests\n\nTo run the test suite, first install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen run `npm test`:\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Current project team members\n\nFor information about the governance of the express.js project, see [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/expressjs/discussions/blob/HEAD/docs/GOVERNANCE.md).\n\nThe original author of Express is [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/tj)\n\n[List of all contributors](https://github.com/expressjs/express/graphs/contributors)\n\n### TC (Technical Committee)\n\n* [UlisesGascon](https://github.com/UlisesGascon) - **Ulises Gascón** (he/him)\n* [jonchurch](https://github.com/jonchurch) - **Jon Church**\n* [wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) - **Wes Todd**\n* [LinusU](https://github.com/LinusU) - **Linus Unnebäck**\n* [blakeembrey](https://github.com/blakeembrey) - **Blake Embrey**\n* [sheplu](https://github.com/sheplu) - **Jean Burellier**\n* [crandmck](https://github.com/crandmck) - **Rand McKinney**\n* [ctcpip](https://github.com/ctcpip) - **Chris de Almeida**\n\n<details>\n<summary>TC emeriti members</summary>\n\n#### TC emeriti members\n\n  * [dougwilson](https://github.com/dougwilson) - **Douglas Wilson**\n  * [hacksparrow](https://github.com/hacksparrow) - **Hage Yaapa**\n  * [jonathanong](https://github.com/jonathanong) - **jongleberry**\n  * [niftylettuce](https://github.com/niftylettuce) - **niftylettuce**\n  * [troygoode](https://github.com/troygoode) - **Troy Goode**\n</details>\n\n\n### Triagers\n\n* [aravindvnair99](https://github.com/aravindvnair99) - **Aravind Nair**\n* [bjohansebas](https://github.com/bjohansebas) - **Sebastian Beltran**\n* [carpasse](https://github.com/carpasse) - **Carlos Serrano**\n* [CBID2](https://github.com/CBID2) - **Christine Belzie**\n* [UlisesGascon](https://github.com/UlisesGascon) - **Ulises Gascón** (he/him)\n* [IamLizu](https://github.com/IamLizu) - **S M Mahmudul Hasan** (he/him)\n* [Phillip9587](https://github.com/Phillip9587) - **Phillip Barta**\n* [efekrskl](https://github.com/efekrskl) - **Efe Karasakal**\n* [rxmarbles](https://github.com/rxmarbles) - **Rick Markins** (he/him)\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Triagers emeriti members</summary>\n\n#### Emeritus Triagers\n\n  * [AuggieH](https://github.com/AuggieH) - **Auggie Hudak**\n  * [G-Rath](https://github.com/G-Rath) - **Gareth Jones**\n  * [MohammadXroid](https://github.com/MohammadXroid) - **Mohammad Ayashi**\n  * [NawafSwe](https://github.com/NawafSwe) - **Nawaf Alsharqi**\n  * [NotMoni](https://github.com/NotMoni) - **Moni**\n  * [VigneshMurugan](https://github.com/VigneshMurugan) - **Vignesh Murugan**\n  * [davidmashe](https://github.com/davidmashe) - **David Ashe**\n  * [digitaIfabric](https://github.com/digitaIfabric) - **David**\n  * [e-l-i-s-e](https://github.com/e-l-i-s-e) - **Elise Bonner**\n  * [fed135](https://github.com/fed135) - **Frederic Charette**\n  * [firmanJS](https://github.com/firmanJS) - **Firman Abdul Hakim**\n  * [getspooky](https://github.com/getspooky) - **Yasser Ameur**\n  * [ghinks](https://github.com/ghinks) - **Glenn**\n  * [ghousemohamed](https://github.com/ghousemohamed) - **Ghouse Mohamed**\n  * [gireeshpunathil](https://github.com/gireeshpunathil) - **Gireesh Punathil**\n  * [jake32321](https://github.com/jake32321) - **Jake Reed**\n  * [jonchurch](https://github.com/jonchurch) - **Jon Church**\n  * [lekanikotun](https://github.com/lekanikotun) - **Troy Goode**\n  * [marsonya](https://github.com/marsonya) - **Lekan Ikotun**\n  * [mastermatt](https://github.com/mastermatt) - **Matt R.

支持所有主流平台：Android、iOS、Windows、macOS、Linux。\n\n- 稳定版本: 每两周更新, 功能稳定  \n  [下载稳定版本](https://github.com/open-ani/animeko/releases/latest)\n\n通常建议使用稳定版本. 如果你愿意参与测试并拥有一定的对 bug 的处理能力, 也欢迎使用测试版本更快体验新功能.\n具体版本类型可查看下方.\n\n- 测试版本: 每两天更新, 体验最新功能  \n  [下载测试版本](https://github.com/open-ani/animeko/releases)\n\n<details>\n<summary> <b>点击查看具体版本类型</b> </summary>\n\nAnimeko 采用语义化版本号, 简单来说就是 `4.x.y` 的格式. 有以下几种版本类型:\n\n- 稳定版本:\n    - **新特性发布**: 当 `x` 更新时, 会有新特性的发布. 通常为 2 周一次.\n    - **Bug 修复**: 当 `y` 更新时, 只会有针对前个版本的重要的 bug 修复. 这些 Bug 修复版本穿插在新特性更新的间隔中,\n      时间不固定.\n- 在稳定版本的发布周期之间, 会发布测试版本:\n    - **Alpha 测试版**: 所有重大新功能都会首先发布到 `alpha` 测试通道, 客户端内可使用 \"每日构建\"\n      接收更新. 这些新功能非常不稳定, 适合热情的先锋测试员!\n    - **Beta 测试版**: 在功能经过 alpha 测试修复重大问题后, 会进入 `beta` 测试通道,\n      在客户端内名称为 \"测试版\". 此版本仍然不稳定, 是一个平衡新功能和稳定性的选择\n\n</details>\n\n## 技术总览\n\n如果你是开发者，我们总是欢迎你提交 PR 参与开发！\n以下几点可以给你一个技术上的大概了解。\n\n- [Kotlin 多平台][Kotlin Multiplatform]架构；\n- 使用新一代响应式 UI 框架 [Compose Multiplatform][Compose Multiplatform] 构建\n  UI；\n- 内置专为 Animeko 打造的“基于 [libtorrent][libtorrent] 的 BitTorrent 引擎，优化边下边播的体验；\n- 高性能弹幕引擎，公益弹幕服务器 + 网络弹幕源；\n- 适配多平台的[视频播放器](https://github.com/open-ani/mediamp)，Android 底层为 [ExoPlayer][ExoPlayer]，PC 底层为 [VLC][VLC]；\n- 多类型数据源适配，内置 [动漫花园][dmhy]、[Mikan]，拥有强大的自定义数据源编辑器和自动数据源选择器。\n\n### 参与开发\n\n欢迎你提交 PR 参与开发，\n有关项目技术细节请参考 [CONTRIBUTING](docs/contributing/README.md)。\n\n## FAQ\n\n### 资源来源是什么?\n\n全部视频数据都来自网络, Animeko 本身不存储任何视频数据。\nAnimeko 支持两大数据源类型：BT 和在线。BT 源即为公共 BitTorrent P2P 网络，\n每个在 BT\n网络上的人都可分享自己拥有的资源供他人下载。在线源即为其他视频资源网站分享的内容。Animeko\n本身并不提供任何视频资源。\n\n本着互助精神，使用 BT 源时 Animeko 会自动做种 (分享数据)。\nBT 指纹为 `-AL4123-`，其中 `4123` 为版本号 `4.12.3`；UA 为类似 `ani_libtorrent/4.12.3`。\n\n### 弹幕来源是什么?\n\nAnimeko 拥有自己的公益弹幕服务器，在 Animeko 应用内发送的弹幕将会发送到弹幕服务器上。每条弹幕都会以\nBangumi\n用户名绑定以防滥用（并考虑未来增加举报和屏蔽功能）。\n\nAnimeko 还会从[弹弹play][ddplay]获取关联弹幕，弹弹play还会从其他弹幕平台例如哔哩哔哩港澳台和巴哈姆特获取弹幕。\n番剧每集可拥有几十到几千条不等的弹幕量。\n",

See [this page](https://docs.steambrew.app/users/installing) for a more detailed guide.\n\n## Features\n### Plugins\n\n-   **TypeScript ([React](https://react.dev/)) frontend** container in Steam\n-   **Lua backend** container in [usermode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-Mode_Driver_Framework)\n-   **[Foreign function interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface)** binding from **Lua** to **TypeScript** and vice versa\n-   **Hook modules in the Steam web browser**\n  -   Overwrite/Modify HTTP requests\n  -   Load custom JavaScript (Native) into web browser\n  -   Load custom StyleSheets into web browser\n    \n### Themes\n-   Manage and load custom themes written in JavaScript and CSS.\n-   Inject JavaScript modules and CSS modules into specific Steam windows,\n-   Provide customizable color, style, and javascript options for your theme,\n    letting users personalize their experience without touching any code\n\n## Official Plugin Repository\n\nMillennium is designed to be fully extensible through plugins.\nTo ensure version compatibility and safety, we maintain a separate, curated [PluginDatabase](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/PluginDatabase) repository.\n\nAll plugins in the PluginDatabase are versioned and reviewed to work seamlessly with the current Millennium release, reducing the risk of conflicts or instability when adding new features.\n\n**For more related information, checkout the [plugin database](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/PluginDatabase)**.\n\n## Adding Languages\n\nOnly languages officially supported by the Steam can be added to the Millennium. Check the list [here](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/localization/languages) in the `Full Platform Supported Languages` section.\n\nTo add your spoken language to Millennium, fork this repository and place your language json (based on the [english locale](./src/locales/english.json)) among the [current locales](./src/locales). Name the file `{your_language}.json` where `your_language` is the `API language code` from the [supported language list](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/localization/languages) and append the target file to the `localizationFiles` in [this file](./src/frontend/utils/localization-manager.ts).\n\nMillennium is only maintaining the english language, and if any changes are made to the english locales that don't reflect on a target language, contributors are responsible for updating them.\n\n## Creating Plugins & Themes\n\nCreating themes and plugins for Millennium is relatively straight foward. Our [documentation](https://docs.steambrew.app/developers) goes over the basics of both,\nand we have examples for both [plugins](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/PluginTemplate) and [themes](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/ThemeTemplate)\n\n## Platform Support\n\nSupported Platforms:\n\n-   Windows (x86/x64/ARM) NT (10 and newer)\n-   Linux (x86/x86_64/i686/i386)\n\n## Sponsors\n\n| <img width=\"25\" height=\"25\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45ad9409-f9dd-4ff4-9737-03386f01a9b2\" /> | Free code signing on Windows provided by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/), certificate by [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n",

This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest\nenvironment consistent with the production live trading environment.\n\nNautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the\nhighest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting\nand live deployment workloads.\n\nThe platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic — with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular\nadapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types\nincluding FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting — enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.\n\n![nautilus-trader](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-trader.png \"nautilus-trader\")\n\n## Features\n\n- **Fast**: Core is written in Rust with asynchronous networking using [tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).\n- **Reliable**: Rust-powered type- and thread-safety, with optional Redis-backed state persistence.\n- **Portable**: OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Deploy using Docker.\n- **Flexible**: Modular adapters mean any REST API or WebSocket feed can be integrated.\n- **Advanced**: Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTC`, `GTD`, `DAY`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency orders including `OCO`, `OUO`, `OTO`.\n- **Customizable**: Add user-defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the [cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) and [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).\n- **Backtesting**: Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution.\n- **Live**: Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments.\n- **Multi-venue**: Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market-making and statistical arbitrage strategies.\n- **AI Training**: Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).\n\n![Alt text](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png \"nautilus\")\n\n> *nautilus - from ancient Greek 'sailor' and naus 'ship'.*\n>\n> *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.\n> The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*\n\n## Why NautilusTrader?\n\n- **Highly performant event-driven Python**: Native binary core components.\n- **Parity between backtesting and live trading**: Identical strategy code.\n- **Reduced operational risk**: Enhanced risk management functionality, logical accuracy, and type safety.\n- **Highly extendable**: Message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters.\n\nTraditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python\nusing vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way\nusing C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot\nexpress the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have\nproven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.\n\nOne of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform\nhave all been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or [Cython](https://cython.org/).\nThis means we're using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,\nwith CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python-native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.\n\n## Why Python?\n\nPython was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straightforward syntax.\nIt has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented programming language.\nBased on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.\nNot only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\n\n## Why Rust?\n\n[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe\nconcurrency. Rust is \"blazingly fast\" and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no garbage collector.\nIt can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily integrates with other languages.\n\nRust's rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety in safe code,\neliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time. Overall safety in this project also depends on\ncorrectly upheld invariants in unsafe blocks and FFI boundaries.\n\nThe project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs)—no Rust toolchain is required at install time.\n\nThis project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):\n\n> “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.\n> The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.\n> As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.\n\n## Integrations\n\nNautilusTrader is modularly designed to work with *adapters*, enabling connectivity to trading venues\nand data providers by translating their raw APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.\n\nThe following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:\n\n| Name                                                                         | ID                    | Type

adapter clients.\n- **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).\n\n### Status\n\n- `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.\n- `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.\n- `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).\n\nSee the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) documentation for further details.\n\n## Versioning and releases\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> **NautilusTrader is still under active development**. Some features may be incomplete, and while\n> the API is becoming more stable, breaking changes can occur between releases.\n> We strive to document these changes in the release notes on a **best-effort basis**.\n\nWe aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental or larger features may cause delays.\n\n### Branches\n\nWe aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.\n\n- `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.\n- `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** and as required.\n- `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x** (likely after the Rust port).\n> Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.\n> This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.\n\n## Precision mode\n\nNautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`),\nwhich differ in their internal bit-width and maximum decimal precision.\n\n- **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.\n- **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> By default, the official Python wheels ship in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.\n> On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.\n> For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.\n\n**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nnautilus_model = { version = \"*\", features = [\"high-precision\"] }\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nWe recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.\n\n**There are two supported ways to install**:\n\n1. Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.\n2. Build from source.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a \"vanilla\" CPython.\n>\n> Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but aren’t officially supported.\n\n### From PyPI\n\nTo install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python's pip package manager:\n\n```bash\npip install -U nautilus_trader\n```\n\nInstall optional dependencies as 'extras' for specific integrations (e.g., `betfair`, `docker`, `dydx`, `ib`, `polymarket`, `visualization`):\n\n```bash\npip install -U \"nautilus_trader[docker,ib]\"\n```\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#extras) for the full list of available extras.\n\n### From the Nautech Systems package index\n\nThe Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.\nThis enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.\n\n#### Stable wheels\n\nStable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.\n\nTo install the latest stable release:\n\n```bash\npip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Use `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url` if you want pip to fall back to PyPI automatically:\n\n#### Development wheels\n\nDevelopment wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,\nallowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.\n\nThis process also helps preserve compute resources and provides easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,\nwhile adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:\n\n- `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).\n- `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).\n\n| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |\n| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |\n| `Linux (x86_64)`   | ✓       | ✓       |\n| `Linux (ARM64)`    | ✓       | -       |\n| `macOS (ARM64)`    | ✓       | ✓       |\n| `Windows (x86_64)` | ✓       | ✓       |\n\n**Note**: Development wheels from the `develop` branch publish for every supported platform except Linux ARM64.\nSkipping that target keeps CI feedback fast while avoiding unnecessary build resource usage.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.\n\n#### Installation commands\n\nBy default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.\n\nTo install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):\n\n```bash\npip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n```\n\nTo install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.221.0a20251026` for October 26, 2025):\n\n```bash\npip install nautilus_trader==1.221.0a20251026 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple\n```\n\n#### Available versions\n\nYou can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).\n\nTo programmatically fetch and list available versions:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP '(?<=<a href=\")[^\"]+(?=\")' | awk -F'#' '{print $1}' | sort\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> On Linux, confirm your glibc version with `ldd --version` and ensure it reports **2.35** or newer before installing binary wheels.\n\n#### Branch updates\n\n- `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): Build and publish continuously with every merged commit.\n- `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): Build and publish daily when we automatically merge the `develop` branch at **14:00 UTC** (if there are changes).\n\n#### Retention policies\n\n- `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): We retain only the most recent wheel build.\n- `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): We retain only the 30 most recent wheel builds.\n\n#### Verifying build provenance\n\nAll release artifacts (wheels and source distributions) published to PyPI, GitHub Releases,\nand the Nautech Systems package index include cryptographic attestations that prove their authenticity and build provenance.\n\nThese attestations are generated automatically during the CI/CD pipeline using [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) build provenance, and can be verified to ensure:\n\n- The artifact was built by the official NautilusTrader GitHub Actions workflow.\n- The artifact corresponds to a specific commit SHA in the repository.\n- The artifact hasn't been tampered with since it was built.\n\nTo verify a wheel file using the GitHub CLI:\n\n```bash\ngh attestation verify nautilus_trader-1.220.0-*.whl --owner nautechsystems\n```\n\nThis provides supply chain security by allowing you to cryptographically verify that the installed package came from the official NautilusTrader build process.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> Attestation verification requires the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) to be installed.\n> Development wheels from `develop` and `nightly` branches are also attested and can be verified the same way.\n\n### From source\n\nIt's possible to install from source using pip if you first install the build dependencies as specified in the `pyproject.toml`.\n\n1. Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (the Rust toolchain installer):\n   - Linux and macOS:\n\n       ```bash\n       curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n       ```\n\n   - Windows:\n       - Download and install [`rustup-init.exe`](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64)\n       - Install \"Desktop development with C++\" using [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)\n   - Verify (any system):\n       from a terminal session run: `rustc --version`\n\n2. Enable `cargo` in the current shell:\n   - Linux and macOS:\n\n       ```bash\n       source $HOME/.cargo/env\n       ```\n\n   - Windows:\n     - Start a new PowerShell\n\n3. Install [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) (a C language frontend for LLVM):\n   - Linux:\n\n       ```bash\n       sudo apt-get install clang\n       ```\n\n   - Windows:\n       1. Add Clang to your [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/):\n          - Start | Visual Studio Installer | Modify | C++ Clang tools for Windows (latest) = checked | Modify\n       2. Enable `clang` in the current shell:\n\n          ```powershell\n          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('path', \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\BuildTools\\VC\\Tools\\Llvm\\x64\\bin\\;\" + $env:Path,\"User\")\n          ```\n\n   - Verify (any system):\n       from a terminal session run: `clang --version`\n\n4. Install uv (see the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) for more details):\n\n    - Linux and macOS:\n\n        ```bash\n        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n        ```\n\n    - Windows (PowerShell):\n\n        ```powershell\n        irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\n        ```\n\n5. Clone the source with `git`, and install from the project's root directory:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone --branch develop --depth 1 https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader\n    cd nautilus_trader\n    uv sync --all-extras\n    ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> The `--depth 1` flag fetches just the latest commit for a faster, lightweight clone.\n\n6. Set environment variables for PyO3 compilation (Linux and macOS only):\n\n    ```bash\n    # Linux only: Set the library path for the Python interpreter\n    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"$(python -c 'import sys; print(sys.base_prefix)')/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\n\n    # Set the Python executable path for PyO3\n    export PYO3_PYTHON=$(pwd)/.venv/bin/python\n\n    # Required for Rust tests when using uv-installed Python\n    export PYTHONHOME=$(python -c \"import sys; print(sys.base_prefix)\")\n    ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` export is Linux-specific and not needed on macOS.\n>\n> The `PYTHONHOME` variable is required when running `make cargo-test` with a `uv`-installed Python.\n> Without it, tests that depend on PyO3 may fail to locate the Python runtime.\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for other options and further details.\n\n## Redis\n\nUsing [Redis](https://redis.io) with NautilusTrader is **optional** and only required if configured as the backend for a\n[cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) database or [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).\nSee the **Redis** section of the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#redis) for further details.\n\n## Makefile\n\nA `Makefile` is provided to automate most installation and build tasks for development. Some of the targets include:\n\n- `make install`: Installs in `release` build mode with all dependency groups and extras.\n- `make install-debug`: Same as `make install` but with `debug` build mode.\n- `make install-just-deps`: Installs just the `main`, `dev` and `test` dependencies (does not install package).\n- `make build`: Runs the build script in `release` build mode (default).\n- `make build-debug`: Runs the build script in `debug` build mode.\n- `make build-wheel`: Runs uv build with a wheel format in `release` mode.\n- `make build-wheel-debug`: Runs uv build with a wheel format in `debug` mode.\n- `make cargo-test`: Runs all Rust crate tests using `cargo-nextest`.\n- `make clean`: Deletes all build results, such as `.so` or `.dll` files.\n- `make distclean`: **CAUTION** Removes all artifacts not in the git index from the repository. This includes source files which have not been `git add`ed.\n- `make docs`: Builds the documentation HTML using Sphinx.\n- `make pre-commit`: Runs the pre-commit checks over all files.\n- `make ruff`: Runs ruff over all files using the `pyproject.toml` config (with autofix).\n- `make pytest`: Runs all tests with `pytest`.\n- `make test-performance`: Runs performance tests with [codspeed](https://codspeed.io).\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Run `make help` for documentation on all available make targets.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> See the [crates/infrastructure/TESTS.md](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/blob/develop/crates/infrastructure/TESTS.md) file for running the infrastructure integration tests.\n\n## Examples\n\nIndicators and strategies can be developed in both Python and Cython. For performance and\nlatency-sensitive applications, we recommend using Cython. Below are some examples:\n\n- [indicator](/nautilus_trader/examples/indicators/ema_python.py) example written in Python.\n- [indicator](/nautilus_trader/indicators/) implementations written in Cython.\n- [strategy](/nautilus_trader/examples/strategies/) examples written in Python.\n- [backtest](/examples/backtest/) examples using a `BacktestEngine` directly.\n\n## Docker\n\nDocker containers are built using the base image `python:3.12-slim` with the following variant tags:\n\n- `nautilus_trader:latest` has the latest release version installed.\n- `nautilus_trader:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed.\n- `jupyterlab:latest` has the latest release version installed along with `jupyterlab` and an\n  example backtest notebook with accompanying data.\n- `jupyterlab:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed along with `jupyterlab` and an\n  example backtest notebook with accompanying data.\n\nYou can pull the container images as follows:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/<image_variant_tag> --platform linux/amd64\n```\n\nYou can launch the backtest example container by running:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:nightly --platform linux/amd64\ndocker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:nightly\n```\n\nThen open your browser at the following address:\n\n```bash\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8888/lab\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> NautilusTrader currently exceeds the rate limit for Jupyter notebook logging (stdout output).\n> Therefore, we set the `log_level` to `ERROR` in the examples. Lowering this level to see more\n> logging will cause the notebook to hang during cell execution. We are investigating a fix that\n> may involve either raising the configured rate limits for Jupyter or throttling the log flushing\n> from Nautilus.\n>\n> - <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/12845>\n> - <https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-limit-output>\n\n## Development\n\nWe aim to provide the most pleasant developer experience possible for this hybrid codebase of Python, Cython and Rust.\nSee the [Developer Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/developer_guide/) for helpful information.\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Run `make build-debug` to compile after changes to Rust or Cython code for the most efficient development workflow.\n\n### Testing with Rust\n\n[cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st) is the standard Rust test runner for NautilusTrader.\nIts key benefit is isolating each test in its own process, ensuring test reliability\nby avoiding interference.\n\nYou can install cargo-nextest by running:\n\n```bash\ncargo install cargo-nextest\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n>\n> Run Rust tests with `make cargo-test`, which uses **cargo-nextest** with an efficient profile.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThank you for considering contributing to NautilusTrader!

Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.\n\nThe key features of Terraform are:\n\n- **Infrastructure as Code**: Infrastructure is described using a high-level configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be shared and re-used.\n\n- **Execution Plans**: Terraform has a \"planning\" step where it generates an execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates infrastructure.\n\n- **Resource Graph**: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources. Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.\n\n- **Change Automation**: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order, avoiding many possible human errors.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [What is Terraform?](https://www.terraform.io/intro) page on the Terraform website.\n\n## Getting Started & Documentation\n\nDocumentation is available on the [Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform):\n\n- [Introduction](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)\n- [Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs)\n\nIf you're new to Terraform and want to get started creating infrastructure, please check out our [Getting Started guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#getting-started) on HashiCorp's learning platform. There are also [additional guides](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform#operations-and-development) to continue your learning.\n\nShow off your Terraform knowledge by passing a certification exam. Visit the [certification page](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/) for information about exams and find [study materials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/certification/terraform-associate) on HashiCorp's learning platform.\n\n## Developing Terraform\n\nThis repository contains only Terraform core, which includes the command line interface and the main graph engine. Providers are implemented as plugins, and Terraform can automatically download providers that are published on [the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io). HashiCorp develops some providers, and others are developed by other organizations. For more information, refer to [Plugin development](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin).\n\n- To learn more about compiling Terraform and contributing suggested changes, refer to [the contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n- To learn more about how we handle bug reports, refer to the [bug triage guide](./BUGPROCESS.md).\n\n- To learn how to contribute to the Terraform documentation, refer to the [Web Unified Docs repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/web-unified-docs).\n\n## License\n\n[Business Source License 1.1](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/main/LICENSE)\n",

      "readme": "# Espressif IoT Development Framework\n\n* [中文版](./README_CN.md)\n\nESP-IDF is the development framework for Espressif SoCs supported on Windows, Linux and macOS.\n\n# ESP-IDF Release Support Schedule\n\n![Support Schedule](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp-idf/support-periods.svg?v=1)\n\n- Please read [the support policy](SUPPORT_POLICY.md) and [the documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/versions.html) for more information about ESP-IDF versions.\n- Please see the [End-of-Life Advisories](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/advisories?keys=&field_type_of_advisory_tid%5B%5D=817) for information about ESP-IDF releases with discontinued support.\n\n# ESP-IDF Release and SoC Compatibility\n\nSee [Compatibility Between ESP-IDF Releases and Revisions of Espressif SoCs](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.md) for the details of the compatibility between ESP-IDF and chip revisions.\n\nEspressif SoCs released before 2016 (ESP8266 and ESP8285) are supported by [RTOS SDK](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK) instead.\n\n# Developing With ESP-IDF\n\n## Setting Up ESP-IDF\n\nSee https://idf.espressif.com/ for links to detailed instructions on how to set up the ESP-IDF depending on chip you use.\n\n**Note:** Each SoC series and each ESP-IDF release has its own documentation. Please see Section [Versions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/versions.html) on how to find documentation and how to checkout specific release of ESP-IDF.\n\n### Non-GitHub forks\n\nESP-IDF uses relative locations as its submodules URLs ([.gitmodules](.gitmodules)). So they link to GitHub. If ESP-IDF is forked to a Git repository which is not on GitHub, you will need to run the script [tools/set-submodules-to-github.sh](tools/set-submodules-to-github.sh) after git clone.\n\nThe script sets absolute URLs for all submodules, allowing `git submodule update --init --recursive` to complete. If cloning ESP-IDF from GitHub, this step is not needed.\n\n## Finding a Project\n\nAs well as the [esp-idf-template](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-template) project mentioned in Getting Started, ESP-IDF comes with some example projects in the [examples](examples) directory.\n\nOnce you've found the project you want to work with, change to its directory and you can configure and build it.\n\nTo start your own project based on an example, copy the example project directory outside of the ESP-IDF directory.\n\n# Quick Reference\n\nSee the Getting Started guide links above for a detailed setup guide. This is a quick reference for common commands when working with ESP-IDF projects:\n\n## Setup Build Environment\n\n(See the Getting Started guide listed above for a full list of required steps with more details.)\n\n* Install host build dependencies mentioned in the Getting Started guide.\n* Run the install script to set up the build environment. The options include `install.bat` or `install.ps1` for Windows, and `install.sh` or `install.fish` for Unix shells.\n* Run the export script on Windows (`export.bat`) or source it on Unix (`source export.sh`) in every shell environment before using ESP-IDF.\n\n## Configuring the Project\n\n* `idf.py set-target <chip_name>` sets the target of the project to `<chip_name>`. Run `idf.py set-target` without any arguments to see a list of supported targets.\n* `idf.py menuconfig` opens a text-based configuration menu where you can configure the project.\n\n## Compiling the Project\n\n`idf.py build`\n\n... will compile app, bootloader and generate a partition table based on the config.\n\n## Flashing the Project\n\nWhen the build finishes, it will print a command line to use `esptool` to flash the chip. However you can also do this automatically by running:\n\n`idf.py -p PORT flash`\n\nReplace PORT with the name of your serial port (like `COM3` on Windows, `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux, or `/dev/cu.usbserial-X` on MacOS. If the `-p` option is left out, `idf.py flash` will try to flash the first available serial port.\n\nThis will flash the entire project (app, bootloader and partition table) to a new chip. The settings for serial port flashing can be configured with `idf.py menuconfig`.\n\nYou don't need to run `idf.py build` before running `idf.py flash`, `idf.py flash` will automatically rebuild anything which needs it.\n\n## Viewing Serial Output\n\nThe `idf.py monitor` target uses the [esp-idf-monitor tool](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-monitor) to display serial output from Espressif SoCs. esp-idf-monitor also has a range of features to decode crash output and interact with the device. [Check the documentation page for details](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/idf-monitor.html).\n\nExit the monitor by typing Ctrl-].\n\nTo build, flash and monitor output in one pass, you can run:\n\n`idf.py flash monitor`\n\n## Compiling & Flashing Only the App\n\nAfter the initial flash, you may just want to build and flash just your app, not the bootloader and partition table:\n\n* `idf.py app` - build just the app.\n* `idf.py app-flash` - flash just the app.\n\n`idf.py app-flash` will automatically rebuild the app if any source files have changed.\n\n(In normal development there's no downside to reflashing the bootloader and partition table each time, if they haven't changed.)\n\n## Erasing Flash\n\nThe `idf.py flash` target does not erase the entire flash contents. However it is sometimes useful to set the device back to a totally erased state, particularly when making partition table changes or OTA app updates. To erase the entire flash, run `idf.py erase-flash`.\n\nThis can be combined with other targets, ie `idf.py -p PORT erase-flash flash` will erase everything and then re-flash the new app, bootloader and partition table.\n\n# Resources\n\n* Documentation for the latest version: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/.

With its advanced templating system and fast asset pipelines, Hugo renders a complete site in seconds, often less.\n\nDue to its flexible framework, multilingual support, and powerful taxonomy system, Hugo is widely used to create:\n\n- Corporate, government, nonprofit, education, news, event, and project sites\n- Documentation sites\n- Image portfolios\n- Landing pages\n- Business, professional, and personal blogs\n- Resumes and CVs\n\nUse Hugo's embedded web server during development to instantly see changes to content, structure, behavior, and presentation. Then deploy the site to your host, or push changes to your Git provider for automated builds and deployment.\n\nHugo's fast asset pipelines include:\n\n- Image processing &ndash; Convert, resize, crop, rotate, adjust colors, apply filters, overlay text and images, and extract EXIF data\n- JavaScript bundling &ndash; Transpile TypeScript and JSX to JavaScript, bundle, tree shake, minify, create source maps, and perform SRI hashing.\n- Sass processing &ndash; Transpile Sass to CSS, bundle, tree shake, minify, create source maps, perform SRI hashing, and integrate with PostCSS\n- Tailwind CSS processing &ndash; Compile Tailwind CSS utility classes into standard CSS, bundle, tree shake, optimize, minify, perform SRI hashing, and integrate with PostCSS\n\nAnd with [Hugo Modules], you can share content, assets, data, translations, themes, templates, and configuration with other projects via public or private Git repositories.\n\nSee the [features] section of the documentation for a comprehensive summary of Hugo's capabilities.\n\n## Sponsors\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p float=\"left\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/go/?utm_source=OSS&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hugo\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/master/assets/images/sponsors/goland.svg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"The complete IDE crafted for professional Go developers.\"></a>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    <a href=\"https://cloudcannon.com/hugo-cms/?utm_campaign=HugoSponsorship&utm_source=sponsor&utm_content=gohugo\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/master/assets/images/sponsors/cloudcannon-cms-logo.svg\" width=\"200\" alt=\"CloudCannon\"></a>\n</p>\n\n## Editions\n\nHugo offers a standard edition with core features, plus extended and extended/deploy editions with more.

For the latest stable and beta releases, visit the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/iina/iina/releases) or the [IINA official website](https://iina.io/). If you want to try out the latest features and improvements before they are officially released, you can download the nightly builds from our [Nightly Download Page](https://iina.io/nightly/).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Nightly builds are generated by GitHub automatically for every commits, which might be buggy and unusable. If you find a bug, please follow the [contributing section](#Contributing) and file an issue.\n\n## Building\n\nIINA uses mpv for media playback. To build IINA, you can either fetch copies of these libraries we have already built (using the instructions below) or build them yourself by skipping to [these instructions](#building-mpv-manually).\n\n### Using the pre-compiled libraries\n\n1. Download pre-compiled libraries by running\n\n```console\n./other/download_libs.sh\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> - Change the URL in the shell script if you want to download arch-specific binaries. By default, it will download the universal ones. You can download other binaries from `https://iina.io/dylibs/${ARCH}/filelist.txt` where `ARCH` can be `universal`, `arm64` and `x86_64`.\n> - If you want to build an older IINA version, make sure to download the corresponding dylibs. For example, `https://iina.io/dylibs/1.2.0/universal/filelist.txt`.\n\n2. Open iina.xcodeproj in the [latest public version of Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835). *IINA may not build if you use any other version.*\n\n3. Build the project.\n\n### Building mpv manually\n\n1. Build your own copy of mpv. If you're using a package manager to manage dependencies, the steps below outline the process.\n\n\t#### With Homebrew\n\n\tUse our tap as it passes in the correct flags to mpv's configure script:\n\n\t```console\n\tbrew tap iina/homebrew-mpv-iina\n\tbrew install mpv-iina\n\t```\n\n\t#### With MacPorts\n\n\tPass in these flags when installing:\n\n\t```console\n\tport install mpv +uchardet -bundle -rubberband configure.args=\"--enable-libmpv-shared --enable-lua --enable-libarchive --enable-libbluray --disable-swift --disable-rubberband\"\n\t```\n\n2. Copy the corresponding mpv and FFmpeg header files into `deps/include/`, replacing the current ones. You can find them on GitHub [(e.g. mpv)](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/libmpv), but it's recommended to copy them from the Homebrew or MacPorts installation. Always make sure the header files have the same version of the dylibs.\n\n3. Run `other/parse_doc.rb`. This script will fetch the latest mpv documentation and generate `MPVOption.swift`, `MPVCommand.swift` and `MPVProperty.swift`. Copy them from `other/` to `iina/`, replacing the current files. This is only needed when updating libmpv. Note that if the API changes, the player source code may also need to be changed.\n\n4. Run `other/change_lib_dependencies.rb`. This script will deploy the dependent libraries into `deps/lib`. If you're using a package manager to manage dependencies, invoke it like so:\n\n\t#### With Homebrew\n\n\t```console\n\tother/change_lib_dependencies.rb \"$(brew --prefix)\" \"$(brew --prefix mpv-iina)/lib/libmpv.dylib\"\n\t```\n\n\t#### With MacPorts\n\n\t```console\n\tport contents mpv | grep '\\.dylib$' | xargs other/change_lib_dependencies.rb /opt/local\n\t```\n\n5. Open `iina.xcodeproj` in the [latest public version of Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835). *IINA may not build if you use any other version.*\n\n6. Remove all references to `.dylib` files from the Frameworks group in the sidebar and add all the `.dylib` files in `deps/lib` to that group by clicking  \"Add Files to iina...\" in the context menu.\n\n7. Add all the imported `.dylib` files into the \"Copy Dylibs\" phase under \"Build Phases\" tab of the iina target.\n\n8. Make sure the necessary `.dylib` files are present in the \"Link Binary With Libraries\" phase under \"Build Phases\". Xcode should have already added all dylibs under this section.\n\n9. Build the project.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIINA is always looking for contributions, whether it's through bug reports, code, or new translations.\n\n* If you find a bug in IINA, or would like to suggest a new feature or enhancement, it'd be nice if you could [search your problem first](https://github.com/iina/iina/issues); while we don't mind duplicates, keeping issues unique helps us save time and consolidates effort. If you can't find your issue, feel free to [file a new one](https://github.com/iina/iina/issues/new/choose).\n\n* If you're looking to contribute code, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — it has information on IINA's process for handling contributions, and tips on how the code is structured to make your work easier.\n\n* If you'd like to translate IINA to your language, please visit [IINA's instance of Crowdin](https://translate.iina.io/). You can create an account for free and start translating. Please do not send a pull request to this repo directly, Crowdin will automatically sync new translations with our repo. If you want to translate IINA into a new language that is currently not on the list, feel free to open an issue.\n",

      "readme": "![OpenWrt logo](include/logo.png)\n\nOpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead\nof trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully\nwritable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the\napplication selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you\nto customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.\nFor developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having\nto build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for\nfull customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.\n\nSunshine!\n\n## Download\n\nBuilt firmware images are available for many architectures and come with a\npackage selection to be used as WiFi home router. To quickly find a factory\nimage usable to migrate from a vendor stock firmware to OpenWrt, try the\n*Firmware Selector*.\n\n* [OpenWrt Firmware Selector](https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/)\n\nIf your device is supported, please follow the **Info** link to see install\ninstructions or consult the support resources listed below.\n\n## \n\nAn advanced user may require additional or specific package. (Toolchain, SDK, ...) For everything else than simple firmware download, try the wiki download page:\n\n* [OpenWrt Wiki Download](https://openwrt.org/downloads)\n\n## Development\n\nTo build your own firmware you need a GNU/Linux, BSD or macOS system (case\nsensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack of a\ncase sensitive file system.\n\n### Requirements\n\nYou need the following tools to compile OpenWrt, the package names vary between\ndistributions. A complete list with distribution specific packages is found in\nthe [Build System Setup](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem)\ndocumentation.\n\n```\nbinutils bzip2 diff find flex gawk gcc-6+ getopt grep install libc-dev libz-dev\nmake4.1+ perl python3.7+ rsync subversion unzip which\n```\n\n### Quickstart\n\n1. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain all the latest package definitions\n   defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default\n\n2. Run `./scripts/feeds install -a` to install symlinks for all obtained\n   packages into package/feeds/\n\n3. Run `make menuconfig` to select your preferred configuration for the\n   toolchain, target system & firmware packages.\n\n4. Run `make` to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build the\n   cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the GNU/Linux kernel & all chosen\n   applications for your target system.\n\n### Related Repositories\n\nThe main repository uses multiple sub-repositories to manage packages of\ndifferent categories. All packages are installed via the OpenWrt package\nmanager called `opkg`. If you're looking to develop the web interface or port\npackages to OpenWrt, please find the fitting repository below.\n\n* [LuCI Web Interface](https://github.com/openwrt/luci): Modern and modular\n  interface to control the device via a web browser.\n\n* [OpenWrt Packages](https://github.com/openwrt/packages): Community repository\n  of ported packages.\n\n* [OpenWrt Routing](https://github.com/openwrt/routing): Packages specifically\n  focused on (mesh) routing.\n\n* [OpenWrt Video](https://github.com/openwrt/video): Packages specifically\n  focused on display servers and clients (Xorg and Wayland).\n\n## Support Information\n\nFor a list of supported devices see the [OpenWrt Hardware Database](https://openwrt.org/supported_devices)\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Quick Start Guide](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-quick-start/start)\n* [User Guide](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/start)\n* [Developer Documentation](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/start)\n* [Technical Reference](https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/start)\n\n### Support Community\n\n* [Forum](https://forum.openwrt.org): For usage, projects, discussions and hardware advise.\n* [Support Chat](https://webchat.oftc.net/#openwrt): Channel `#openwrt` on **oftc.net**.\n\n### Developer Community\n\n* [Bug Reports](https://bugs.openwrt.org): Report bugs in OpenWrt\n* [Dev Mailing List](https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel): Send patches\n* [Dev Chat](https://webchat.oftc.net/#openwrt-devel): Channel `#openwrt-devel` on **oftc.net**.\n\n## License\n\nOpenWrt is licensed under GPL-2.0\n",

The project was started by the Coop Deluxe Team. The purpose is to actively maintain and improve, but also continue sm64ex-coop, created by djoslin0. More features, customization, and power to the Lua API allow modders and players to enjoy Super Mario 64 more than ever!\n\nFeel free to report bugs or contribute to the project. \n\n## Initial Goal (Accomplished)\nCreate a mod for the PC port where multiple people can play together online.\n\nUnlike previous multiplayer projects, this one synchronizes enemies and events. This allows players to interact with the same world at the same time.\n\nInterestingly enough though, the goal of the project has slowly evolved over time from simply just making a Super Mario 64 multiplayer mod to constantly maintaining and improving the project (notably the Lua API.)\n\n## Lua\nsm64coopdx is moddable via Lua, similar to Roblox and Garry's Mod's Lua APIs. To get started, click [here](docs/lua/lua.md) to see the Lua documentation.\n\n## Wiki\nThe wiki is made using GitHub's wiki feature, you can go to the wiki tab or click [here](https://github.com/coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx/wiki).\n",

This ensures that you can’t reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    var a = 1;\n    var b = 2;\n\n    // good\n    const a = 1;\n    const b = 2;\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"references--disallow-var\"></a><a name=\"2.2\"></a>\n  - [2.2](#references--disallow-var) If you must reassign references, use `let` instead of `var`. eslint: [`no-var`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var)\n\n    > Why? `let` is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like `var`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    var count = 1;\n    if (true) {\n      count += 1;\n    }\n\n    // good, use the let.\n    let count = 1;\n    if (true) {\n      count += 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"references--block-scope\"></a><a name=\"2.3\"></a>\n  - [2.3](#references--block-scope) Note that both `let` and `const` are block-scoped, whereas `var` is function-scoped.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // const and let only exist in the blocks they are defined in.\n    {\n      let a = 1;\n      const b = 1;\n      var c = 1;\n    }\n    console.log(a); // ReferenceError\n    console.log(b); // ReferenceError\n    console.log(c); // Prints 1\n    ```\n\n    In the above code, you can see that referencing `a` and `b` will produce a ReferenceError, while `c` contains the number. This is because `a` and `b` are block scoped, while `c` is scoped to the containing function.\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Objects\n\n  <a name=\"objects--no-new\"></a><a name=\"3.1\"></a>\n  - [3.1](#objects--no-new) Use the literal syntax for object creation. eslint: [`no-new-object`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-new-object)\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const item = new Object();\n\n    // good\n    const item = {};\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-computed-properties\"></a><a name=\"3.4\"></a>\n  - [3.2](#es6-computed-properties) Use computed property names when creating objects with dynamic property names.\n\n    > Why? They allow you to define all the properties of an object in one place.\n\n    ```javascript\n\n    function getKey(k) {\n      return `a key named ${k}`;\n    }\n\n    // bad\n    const obj = {\n      id: 5,\n      name: 'San Francisco',\n    };\n    obj[getKey('enabled')] = true;\n\n    // good\n    const obj = {\n      id: 5,\n      name: 'San Francisco',\n      [getKey('enabled')]: true,\n    };\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-object-shorthand\"></a><a name=\"3.5\"></a>\n  - [3.3](#es6-object-shorthand) Use object method shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand)\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const atom = {\n      value: 1,\n\n      addValue: function (value) {\n        return atom.value + value;\n      },\n    };\n\n    // good\n    const atom = {\n      value: 1,\n\n      addValue(value) {\n        return atom.value + value;\n      },\n    };\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"es6-object-concise\"></a><a name=\"3.6\"></a>\n  - [3.4](#es6-object-concise) Use property value shorthand. eslint: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand)\n\n    > Why? It is shorter and descriptive.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';\n\n    // bad\n    const obj = {\n      lukeSkywalker: lukeSkywalker,\n    };\n\n    // good\n    const obj = {\n      lukeSkywalker,\n    };\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"objects--grouped-shorthand\"></a><a name=\"3.7\"></a>\n  - [3.5](#objects--grouped-shorthand) Group your shorthand properties at the beginning of your object declaration.\n\n    > Why? It’s easier to tell which properties are using the shorthand.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const anakinSkywalker = 'Anakin Skywalker';\n    const lukeSkywalker = 'Luke Skywalker';\n\n    // bad\n    const obj = {\n      episodeOne: 1,\n      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,\n      lukeSkywalker,\n      episodeThree: 3,\n      mayTheFourth: 4,\n      anakinSkywalker,\n    };\n\n    // good\n    const obj = {\n      lukeSkywalker,\n      anakinSkywalker,\n      episodeOne: 1,\n      twoJediWalkIntoACantina: 2,\n      episodeThree: 3,\n      mayTheFourth: 4,\n    };\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"objects--quoted-props\"></a><a name=\"3.8\"></a>\n  - [3.6](#objects--quoted-props) Only quote properties that are invalid identifiers. eslint: [`quote-props`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quote-props)\n\n    > Why? In general we consider it subjectively easier to read. It improves syntax highlighting, and is also more easily optimized by many JS engines.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const bad = {\n      'foo': 3,\n      'bar': 4,\n      'data-blah': 5,\n    };\n\n    // good\n    const good = {\n      foo: 3,\n      bar: 4,\n      'data-blah': 5,\n    };\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"objects--prototype-builtins\"></a>\n  - [3.7](#objects--prototype-builtins) Do not call `Object.prototype` methods directly, such as `hasOwnProperty`, `propertyIsEnumerable`, and `isPrototypeOf`. eslint: [`no-prototype-builtins`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-prototype-builtins)\n\n    > Why? These methods may be shadowed by properties on the object in question - consider `{ hasOwnProperty: false }` - or, the object may be a null object (`Object.create(null)`).

Instead, if you do make accessor functions, use `getVal()` and `setVal('hello')`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    class Dragon {\n      get age() {\n        // ...\n      }\n\n      set age(value) {\n        // ...\n      }\n    }\n\n    // good\n    class Dragon {\n      getAge() {\n        // ...\n      }\n\n      setAge(value) {\n        // ...\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"accessors--boolean-prefix\"></a><a name=\"23.3\"></a>\n  - [24.3](#accessors--boolean-prefix) If the property/method is a `boolean`, use `isVal()` or `hasVal()`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    if (!dragon.age()) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    // good\n    if (!dragon.hasAge()) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"accessors--consistent\"></a><a name=\"23.4\"></a>\n  - [24.4](#accessors--consistent) It’s okay to create `get()` and `set()` functions, but be consistent.\n\n    ```javascript\n    class Jedi {\n      constructor(options = {}) {\n        const lightsaber = options.lightsaber || 'blue';\n        this.set('lightsaber', lightsaber);\n      }\n\n      set(key, val) {\n        this[key] = val;\n      }\n\n      get(key) {\n        return this[key];\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## Events\n\n  <a name=\"events--hash\"></a><a name=\"24.1\"></a>\n  - [25.1](#events--hash) When attaching data payloads to events (whether DOM events or something more proprietary like Backbone events), pass an object literal (also known as a \"hash\") instead of a raw value. This allows a subsequent contributor to add more data to the event payload without finding and updating every handler for the event. For example, instead of:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    $(this).trigger('listingUpdated', listing.id);\n\n    // ...\n\n    $(this).on('listingUpdated', (e, listingID) => {\n      // do something with listingID\n    });\n    ```\n\n    prefer:\n\n    ```javascript\n    // good\n    $(this).trigger('listingUpdated', { listingID: listing.id });\n\n    // ...\n\n    $(this).on('listingUpdated', (e, data) => {\n      // do something with data.listingID\n    });\n    ```\n\n  **[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**\n\n## jQuery\n\n  <a name=\"jquery--dollar-prefix\"></a><a name=\"25.1\"></a>\n  - [26.1](#jquery--dollar-prefix) Prefix jQuery object variables with a `$`.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    const sidebar = $('.sidebar');\n\n    // good\n    const $sidebar = $('.sidebar');\n\n    // good\n    const $sidebarBtn = $('.sidebar-btn');\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"jquery--cache\"></a><a name=\"25.2\"></a>\n  - [26.2](#jquery--cache) Cache jQuery lookups.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // bad\n    function setSidebar() {\n      $('.sidebar').hide();\n\n      // ...\n\n      $('.sidebar').css({\n        'background-color': 'pink',\n      });\n    }\n\n    // good\n    function setSidebar() {\n      const $sidebar = $('.sidebar');\n      $sidebar.hide();\n\n      // ...\n\n      $sidebar.css({\n        'background-color': 'pink',\n      });\n    }\n    ```\n\n  <a name=\"jquery--queries\"></a><a name=\"25.3\"></a>\n  - [26.3](#jquery--queries) For DOM queries use Cascading `$('.sidebar ul')` or parent > child `$('.sidebar > ul')`.

[`tape`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape) is also used occasionally for small, separate modules.\n    - 100% test coverage is a good goal to strive for, even if it’s not always practical to reach it.\n    - Whenever you fix a bug, *write a regression test*.

It aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and customizable file management experience.\n\n💡 A new article explaining its internal workings: [Why is Yazi Fast?](https://yazi-rs.github.io/blog/why-is-yazi-fast)\n\n- 🚀 **Full Asynchronous Support**: All I/O operations are asynchronous, CPU tasks are spread across multiple threads, making the most of available resources.\n- 💪 **Powerful Async Task Scheduling and Management**: Provides real-time progress updates, task cancellation, and internal task priority assignment.\n- 🖼️ **Built-in Support for Multiple Image Protocols**: Also integrated with Überzug++ and Chafa, covering almost all terminals.\n- 🌟 **Built-in Code Highlighting and Image Decoding**: Combined with the pre-loading mechanism, greatly accelerates image and normal file loading.\n- 🔌 **Concurrent Plugin System**: UI plugins (rewriting most of the UI), functional plugins, custom previewer/preloader/spotter/fetcher; Just some pieces of Lua.\n- ☁️ **Virtual Filesystem**: Remote file management, custom search engines.\n- 📡 **Data Distribution Service**: Built on a client-server architecture (no additional server process required), integrated with a Lua-based publish-subscribe model, achieving cross-instance communication and state persistence.\n- 📦 **Package Manager**: Install plugins and themes with one command, keeping them up-to-date, or pin them to a specific version.\n- 🧰 Integration with ripgrep, fd, fzf, zoxide\n- 💫 Vim-like input/pick/confirm/which/notify component, auto-completion for cd paths\n- 🏷️ Multi-Tab Support, Cross-directory selection, Scrollable Preview (for videos, PDFs, archives, code, directories, etc.)\n- 🔄 Bulk Renaming, Archive Extraction, Visual Mode, File Chooser, [Git Integration](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi), [Mount Manager](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/mount.yazi)\n- 🎨 Theme System, Mouse Support, Trash Bin, Custom Layouts, CSI u, OSC 52\n- ... and more!\n\nhttps://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/assets/17523360/92ff23fa-0cd5-4f04-b387-894c12265cc7\n\n## Project status\n\nPublic beta, can be used as a daily

It is\ncompatible with the [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and can\ndisplay images, headings, lists (including task lists), blockquotes, code blocks, tables,\nand thematic breaks, besides styled text and links.\n\nMarkdownUI offers comprehensible theming features to customize how it displays Markdown text.\nYou can use the built-in themes, create your own or override specific text and block styles.\n\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/MarkdownUI@2x.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/MarkdownUI~dark@2x.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\n## Minimum requirements\n\nYou can use MarkdownUI on the following platforms:\n\n- macOS 12.0+\n- iOS 15.0+\n- tvOS 15.0+\n- watchOS 8.0+\n\nSome features, like displaying tables or multi-image paragraphs, require macOS 13.0+, iOS 16.0+,\ntvOS 16.0+, and watchOS 9.0+.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Creating a Markdown view\n\nA `Markdown` view displays rich structured text using the Markdown syntax. It can display images,\nheadings, lists (including task lists), blockquotes, code blocks, tables, and thematic breaks,\nbesides styled text and links.\n\nThe simplest way of creating a `Markdown` view is to pass a Markdown string to the\n`init(_:baseURL:imageBaseURL:)` initializer.\n\n```swift\nlet markdownString = \"\"\"\n  ## Try MarkdownUI\n\n  **MarkdownUI** is a native Markdown renderer for SwiftUI\n  compatible with the\n  [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/).\n  \"\"\"\n\nvar body: some View {\n  Markdown(markdownString)\n}\n```\n\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/MarkdownString@2x.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/MarkdownString~dark@2x.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\nA more convenient way to create a `Markdown` view is by using the\n`init(baseURL:imageBaseURL:content:)` initializer, which takes a Markdown content\nbuilder in which you can compose the view content, either by providing Markdown strings or by\nusing an expressive domain-specific language.\n\n```swift\nvar body: some View {\n  Markdown {\n    \"\"\"\n    ## Using a Markdown Content Builder\n    Use Markdown strings or an expressive domain-specific language\n    to build the content.\n    \"\"\"\n    Heading(.level2) {\n      \"Try MarkdownUI\"\n    }\n    Paragraph {\n      Strong(\"MarkdownUI\")\n      \" is a native Markdown renderer for SwiftUI\"\n      \" compatible with the \"\n      InlineLink(\n        \"GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec\",\n        destination: URL(string: \"https://github.github.com/gfm/\")!\n      )\n      \".\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/MarkdownContentBuilder@2x.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/MarkdownContentBuilder~dark@2x.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\nYou can also create a `MarkdownContent` value in your model layer and later create a `Markdown`\nview by passing the content value to the `init(_:baseURL:imageBaseURL:)` initializer. The\n`MarkdownContent` value pre-parses the Markdown string preventing the view from doing this step.\n\n```swift\n// Somewhere in the model layer\nlet content = MarkdownContent(\"You can try **CommonMark** [here](https://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/).\")\n\n// Later in the view layer\nvar body: some View {\n  Markdown(self.model.content)\n}\n```\n\n### Styling Markdown\n\nMarkdown views use a basic default theme to display the contents. For more information, read about\nthe `basic` theme.\n\n```swift\nMarkdown {\n  \"\"\"\n  You can quote text with a `>`.\n\n  > Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a\n  > dog it's too dark to read.\n\n  – Groucho Marx\n  \"\"\"\n}\n```\n\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/BlockquoteContent@2x.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/BlockquoteContent~dark@2x.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\nYou can customize the appearance of Markdown content by applying different themes using the\n`markdownTheme(_:)` modifier. For example, you can apply one of the built-in themes, like\n`gitHub`, to either a Markdown view or a view hierarchy that contains Markdown views.\n\n```swift\nMarkdown {\n  \"\"\"\n  You can quote text with a `>`.\n\n  > Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a\n  > dog it's too dark to read.\n\n  – Groucho Marx\n  \"\"\"\n}\n.markdownTheme(.gitHub)\n```\n\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/GitHubBlockquote@2x.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/GitHubBlockquote~dark@2x.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\nTo override a specific text style from the current theme, use the `markdownTextStyle(_:textStyle:)`\nmodifier. The following example shows how to override the `code` text style.\n\n```swift\nMarkdown {\n  \"\"\"\n  Use `git status` to list all new or modified files\n  that haven't yet been committed.\n  \"\"\"\n}\n.markdownTextStyle(\\.code) {\n  FontFamilyVariant(.monospaced)\n  FontSize(.em(0.85))\n  ForegroundColor(.purple)\n  BackgroundColor(.purple.opacity(0.25))\n}\n```\n\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/CustomInlineCode@2x.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/CustomInlineCode~dark@2x.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\nYou can also use the `markdownBlockStyle(_:body:)` modifier to override a specific block style. For\nexample, you can override only the `blockquote` block style, leaving other block styles untouched.\n\n```swift\nMarkdown {\n  \"\"\"\n  You can quote text with a `>`.\n\n  > Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a\n  > dog it's too dark to read.\n\n  – Groucho Marx\n  \"\"\"\n}\n.markdownBlockStyle(\\.blockquote) { configuration in\n  configuration.label\n    .padding()\n    .markdownTextStyle {\n      FontCapsVariant(.lowercaseSmallCaps)\n      FontWeight(.semibold)\n      BackgroundColor(nil)\n    }\n    .overlay(alignment: .leading) {\n      Rectangle()\n        .fill(Color.teal)\n        .frame(width: 4)\n    }\n    .background(Color.teal.opacity(0.5))\n}\n```\n\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/CustomBlockquote@2x.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n![](Sources/MarkdownUI/Documentation.docc/Resources/CustomBlockquote~dark@2x.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\nAnother way to customize the appearance of Markdown content is to create your own theme. To create\na theme, start by instantiating an empty `Theme` and chain together the different text and block\nstyles in a single expression.\n\n```swift\nextension Theme {\n  static let fancy = Theme()\n    .code {\n      FontFamilyVariant(.monospaced)\n      FontSize(.em(0.85))\n    }\n    .link {\n      ForegroundColor(.purple)\n    }\n    // More text styles...\n    .paragraph { configuration in\n      configuration.label\n        .relativeLineSpacing(.em(0.25))\n        .markdownMargin(top: 0, bottom: 16)\n    }\n    .listItem { configuration in\n      configuration.label\n        .markdownMargin(top: .em(0.25))\n    }\n    // More block styles...\n}\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n[Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com) kindly hosts the online documentation for all versions, available here:\n\n- [main](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/main/documentation/markdownui)\n- [2.1.0](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.1.0/documentation/markdownui)\n- [2.0.2](https://swiftpackageindex.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui/2.0.2/documentation/markdownui)\n\n### Related content\n\nYou can learn more about MarkdownUI by referring to the following articles and third-party resources:\n\n- [Better Markdown Rendering in SwiftUI](https://gonzalezreal.github.io/2023/02/18/better-markdown-rendering-in-swiftui.html)\n- [Unlock the Power of Markdown in SwiftUI with THIS Hack!](https://youtu.be/gVy06iJQFWQ) by [@Rebeloper](https://twitter.com/Rebeloper)\n\n## Demo\n\nMarkdownUI comes with a few more tricks on the sleeve. You can explore the\n[companion demo project](Examples/Demo/) and discover its complete set of capabilities.\n\n![](Examples/Demo/Screenshot.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n![](Examples/Demo/Screenshot~dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\n## Installation\n### Adding MarkdownUI to a Swift package\n\nTo use MarkdownUI in a Swift Package Manager project, add the following line to the dependencies in your `Package.swift` file:\n\n```swift\n.package(url: \"https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui\", from: \"2.0.2\")\n```\n\nInclude `\"MarkdownUI\"` as a dependency for your executable target:\n\n```swift\n.target(name: \"<target>\", dependencies: [\n  .product(name: \"MarkdownUI\", package: \"swift-markdown-ui\")\n]),\n```\n\nFinally, add `import MarkdownUI` to your source code.\n\n### Adding MarkdownUI to an Xcode project\n\n1.

(You know some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are just too bright.)\n\nLooking for a better app installer? Try **InstallerX**!\n\nMany customized Chinese ROMs come with subpar default installers. You can replace them with **InstallerX Revived**.\n\nCompared to stock installers, **InstallerX Revived** offers more installation features:\n- Rich installation types: APK, APKS, APKM, XAPK, APKs inside ZIP, and batch APKs.\n- Dialog-based installation\n- Notification-based installation (Live Activity API supported)\n- Automatic installation\n- Installer declaration\n- Setting install flags (can inherit Profile settings)\n- Install for specific user / all users\n- Dex2oat after successful installation\n- Block the installation of specific app's packageName or by sharedUID\n- Auto-delete APK after installation\n- No shell commands, native API calls only\n\n## Supported Versions\n\n- **Full support:** Android SDK 34 - 36.1 (Android 14 - 16)\n- **Limited support:** Android SDK 26 - 33 (Android 8.0 - 13) (please report issues)\n\n## Key Changes and Features\n\n- **UI Options:** Switchable between a new UI design based on Material 3 Expressive and Miuix which is like HyperOS.\n- **More Customization:** More customizable interface settings.\n- **Bug fixes:** Resolved APK deletion issues from the original project on certain systems.\n- **Performance:** Optimized parsing speed, improved parsing of various package types.\n- **Multilingual support:** More languages supported. Contributions for more languages are welcome!\n- **Dialog optimization:** Improved installation dialog display.\n- **System Icons:** Support for displaying system icon packs during installation. Allows switching between APK icons and system icon packs through a toggle.\n- **Version Comparison:** Support for displaying version number comparison in single-line or multi-line format.\n- **SDK Information:** Installation dialogs show targetSDK and minSDK in single-line or multi-line format.\n- **Session Install Confirmation**: With the help of [InxLocker](https://github.com/Chimioo/InxLocker), confirming installations from store apps (Aurora Store, F-Droid, etc.) is now supported.\n- **Bypass Interceptions:** Shizuku/Root can bypass custom OS chain-start restrictions when opening an App after installation.\n    - Currently only works for dialog installation.\n    - Dhizuku lacks sufficient permissions, so a customizable countdown option was added to reserve time for the app opening action.\n- **Extended Menu:** For dialog installation (can be enabled in settings):\n    - Displays permissions requested by the application.\n    - InstallFlags configuration (can inherit global Profile settings).\n      - **Important:** Setting InstallFlags **does not guarantee** they will always work. Some options might pose security risks, depending on the system.\n- **Preset Sources:** Support for pre-configuring installation source package names in settings, allowing quick selection in profiles and the dialog installation menu.\n- **Install from ZIP:** Support for installing APK files inside ZIP archives (dialog installation only).\n    - Supports unlimited quantity and multiple ZIP files.\n    - Supports APK files in nested directories within the ZIP, **not limited to the root directory**.\n    - Supports automatic handling of multiple versions of the same package:\n        - Deduplication\n        - Smart selection of the best package to install.\n- **Batch Installation:** Support for installing multiple APKs at once (multi-select and share to InstallerX).\n    - Dialog installation only.\n    - No quantity limit.\n    - APK files only.\n    - Supports automatic handling of multiple versions of the same package (deduplication and smart selection).\n- **APKS/APKM/XAPK Files:** Support for automatic selection of the best split.\n    - Supports both notification and dialog installation.\n        - Clicking \"Install\" in the notification selects the best option and proceeds with installation.\n        - In the dialog, the best option is selected by default, but can be chosen manually.\n    - The split selection interface shows user-friendly descriptions.\n- **Architecture Support:** Allows installing armeabi-v7a packages on arm64-v8a only systems (actual functionality depends on the system providing runtime translation).\n- **Downgrade with or without Data:** Support for performing app downgrades with or without data preservation on some OEM Android 15 systems.\n    - This feature only supports Android 15. On Android 14 or below, try the `Allow downgrade` option in the install options.\n    - The feature is available in the smart suggestions of the dialog installation. To use it, first enable the `Show smart suggestions` option.\n    - **Use this feature with extreme caution on system apps!** Loss of data from a system app could render the device unusable.\n    - Not compatible with OneUI 7.0, RealmeUI, and some ColorOS versions (AOSP has fixed). If you only see the downgrade option *without* data preservation, it means your system does not support downgrade *with* data.\n- **Blacklist:** Support for configuring a list of banned package names for installation in the settings.\n    - Support blacklist by packageName / sharedUID with exemptions\n    - `Allow once` in smart suggestions\n- **DexOpt:** After successful installation, the app can automatically perform dex2oat on the installed applications according to the configured Profile settings.\n    - Does not support Dhizuku\n- **Signature Verification：** Verify the signature of the installed app and apk to install, and give a warning if they do not match.\n- **Select Target User:** Support installing apps to a specific user.\n    - Dynamically obtain current user details.\n    - Does not support Dhizuku\n    - Can be overridden by `Install For All Users` install option\n- **Declare as Uninstaller:** Accept Uninstall intent on certain OS, custom OS may not be supported.\n- [Experimental] **Directly Install From Download Link:** The online version supports directly sharing the download link of an APK file to InstallerX for installation. Currently, the APK is not kept locally, but an option to retain the installation package will be added in the future.\n\n## FAQ\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Please read the FAQ before providing feedback.\n> When providing feedback, please specify your phone brand, system version, software version, and operation in detail.\n\n- **Dhizuku not working properly?**\n    - Support for **official Dhizuku** is limited. Tested on AVDs with SDK ≥34. Operation on SDK <34 is not guaranteed.\n    - When using `OwnDroid`, the `Auto delete after installation` function might not work correctly.\n    - On Chinese ROMs, occasional errors are usually due to the system restricting Dhizuku's background operation. It is recommended to restart the Dhizuku app first.\n    - Dhizuku has limited permissions. Many operations are not possible (like bypassing system intent interceptors or specifying the installation source). Using Shizuku is recommended if possible.\n\n- **Unable to lock InstallerX as default installer?**\n    - Some Systems have very strict policy on Package Installers. You must use a LSPosed module to intercept the intent and forward it to the installer in this case.\n    - Works best with: [Chimioo/InxLocker](https://github.com/Chimioo/InxLocker)\n    - Other lockers working as LSPosed are no longer recommended\n\n- An error occurred in the resolution phase: `No Content Provider` or `reading provider` reported `Permission Denial`?\n    - You have enabled Hide app list or similar functions, please configure the whitelist.\n\n- **HyperOS shows \"Installing system apps requires declaring a valid installer\" error**\n    - It's a system security restriction. You must declare an installer that is a system app (recommended: `com.android.fileexplorer` or `com.android.vending` for HyperOS; app store for Vivo).\n    - Works with Shizuku/Root. **Dhizuku is not supported**.\n    - New feature: InstallerX automatically detects HyperOS and adds a default configuration (`com.miui.packageinstaller`). You can change it in the settings if needed.\n\n- **HyperOS reinstalls the default installer / locking fails**\n    - Try enabling `Auto Lock Installer` in settings.\n    - On some HyperOS versions, locking failure is expected.\n    - HyperOS intercepts USB installation requests (ADB/Shizuku) with a dialog. If the user rejects the installation of a new app, the system will revoke the installer setting and force the default one. If this happens, lock InstallerX again.\n\n- **Notification progress bar freezes**\n    - Some custom OS has very strict background app controls. Set \"No background restrictions\" for the app if you encounter this.\n    - The app is optimized: it ends all background services and closes 1 second after completing the installation task (when the user clicks \"Done\" or clears the notification). You can enable the foreground service notification to monitor.\n\n- **Problems on Oppo/Vivo/Lenovo/... systems?**\n    - We do not have devices from these brands for testing. You can discuss it in [Discussions](https://github.com/wxxsfxyzm/InstallerX-Revived/discussions), or report through our [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/installerx_revived).\n    - To lock the installer on Oppo/Vivo, use the lock tool.\n    - To install apps through shizuku on Honor devices, disable `Monitor ADB install` in developer settings.\n\n## About Releases\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Development versions may be unstable and features may change/be removed without any notice.\n> Switching build channels may require data wipe/reinstallation.\n\n- **`dev` branch:** Contains features under development. If you want to test them, look for the corresponding CI builds in Github Actions.\n- **`main` branch:** When stable changes are merged from `dev`, the CI/CD system automatically builds and publishes a new alpha version.\n- **Stable releases:** Manually published when finishing a development/testing phase. CI/CD automatically publishes them as a release.\n- **About network permission:** As features have expanded, some network-related functions have been introduced. However, many users prefer the installer to remain purely local without requiring network access. Therefore, two versions will be released: **online** and **offline**. Both versions share the same package name, version code, and signature, so they can't be installed side by side (but can be replaced directly). Please download according to your needs.\n  - **Online version**: Supports sharing direct download links to InstallerX for installation. More network-related utilities may be added in the future, but network permission will **never** be used for non-installation purposes. Safe to use.\n  - **Offline version**: Requests no network permissions at all. When attempting to use online features, you will receive a clear error message. This version remains a purely local installer.\n\n## About Localization\n\nHelp us translate this project!

See the Makefile for reference.\nYou can find binaries (.apk), logs, test results & other outputs in the dist/ directory.  \nExample: `make all install run`.\n\nThe project code style is the [AOSP Java Code Style](https://source.android.com/source/code-style#follow-field-naming-conventions). Use the _auto reformat_ menu option of Android Studio before commiting or before you create the pull request.\n\n### Technologies / Dependencies\n* Java, Android SDK, AndroidX\n* No dependency on NDK, 1 APK = all Android supported Architectures\n* Editor: Advanced component based on Android EditText\n* Preview: Android WebView\n* Editor syntax highlighting: Custom implementation for all supported formats\n* Markdown parser: [flexmark-java](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java/wiki/Extensions)\n* Zim/WikiText parser: Custom implementation, transpiling to Markdown\n* todo.txt parser: Custom implementation\n* Binary support: WebView html img/audio/video with support for most common formats\n* CI/CD: GitHub Actions\n* Build system: Gradle, Makefile\n\n### Resources\n* Project repository: [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) | [Issues](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) | [Discussions](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/discussions) | [License](/LICENSE.txt) | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/releases) | [Makefile](Makefile)\n* F-Droid: [Listing](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.gsantner.markor) | [Wiki](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/net.gsantner.markor) | [Metadata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/blob/master/metadata/net.gsantner.markor.yml) | [Build log](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/net.gsantner.markor/lastbuild)\n\n\n## Privacy<a name=\"privacy\"></a>\nMarkor does not use your internet connection unless your own user-generated content references external resources (for example, when you reference an external image by URL).\nThe app works completely offline, no internet connection required!\nNo personal data is shared with the author or any third parties.\nFiles can be shared to other apps from inside the app by pressing the share button.\nFiles are stored locally in a user selectable folder, defaulting to the internal storage \"Documents\" directory.\n\n#### Android Permissions\n* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE  \n  Read from and write files to storage.\n* INTERNET  \n  In user-generated content data can be loaded from the internet.\n* INSTALL_SHORTCUT  \n  Install a shortcut to launchers to open a file/folder in Markor.\n\n## License\nThe code of the app is licensed Apache 2.0.  \nLocalization & translation files (string\\*.xml) as well samples are licensed CC0 1.0 (public domain).  \nProject is based on the unmaintained projects writeily and writeily-pro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# FAQ\n\n## File browser & file management\n\n#### How do I save a file?\nMarkor automatically saves text when you leave Markor or close a file. Additionally there is save button in the top menu.\n\n#### How do I save files to SD Cards?\nBrowse to the start folder of your SD Card and press the + button (using file browser or the menu option). Now press the plus button and follow the steps in the dialog. Afterwards Markor's file browser won't strike out filenames anymore and files are writable.\n\n![sdcard-mount](doc/assets/2019-05-06-sdcard-mount.webp)\n\n#### How to synchronize files?\nMarkor is and will stay an offline focused application. It works with sync synchronization apps, they have to do syncing respectively.\nSync clients known to work in combination include BitTorrent Sync, Dropbox, FolderSync, OwnCloud, NextCloud, Seafile, Syncthing, Syncopoli and others.  \nThe project recommendation is Syncthing. [-> Guide for Syncthing](doc/2020-04-04-syncthing-file-sync-setup-how-to-use-with-markor.md)\n\n#### What is Notebook?\nThe root folder of your files! Markor starts with this folder at the main screen and allows you to browse files. You can work at any (accessible) file & location with Markor.\n\n#### What is ToDo?\nYour main to-do list file in todo.txt format. You can access it by swiping once at the main screen, by selecting todo.txt at Notebook, or by using the dedicated launcher. You can also open it from Notebook or other apps! You will also have the option to create a to-do task when sharing text into Markor when the text is just one line. The location of this file is freely choosable and independent from the Notebook directory.\n\n#### What is QuickNote?\nThe fastest and easiest way to take notes! QuickNote is a file in Markdown format with a freely choosable file location. You can access it by swiping twice at the main screen, by selecting QuickNote at Notebook, or by using the dedicated launcher. The location of this file is freely choosable and independent from the Notebook directory.\n\n#### How can I encrypt my notes?\nYou have to set a master password in Settings/General/File encryption password and toggle \"Encrypt file content\" when you create a note that you want encrypted.\nIf you want to use a different password for a different file you will have to change the master password before you create that file.\nMarkor remembers locally only the last used password and automatically decrypts only the content of the files that use the most recent password, if you don't want markor to automatically decrypt any file you can set the master password to some random string. \n\n#### Launchers\nA launcher is a \"start menu option\" in your devices launcher (=appdrawer / start menu). When Markor is installed you have the start menu option for Markor. When the Markor settings option \"Launcher (Special Documents)\" is enabled, you get the additional start menu options for ToDo and QuickNote. Note that a device restart is required when you change this option.\n\n## Format: Markdown\n#### What is Markdown?\nA general purpose markup format for documents of all kinds. As Markdown gets converted to HTML prior displaying a rendered view, you can also include HTML in the text, thus you can do everything web browsers can do.\n\nCommonMark is the specification that the markdown parser used in Markor implements.\n\n| **Resources** | |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| [CommonMark tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)           | Learn Markdown in 10 minutes |\n| [CommonMark help](http://commonmark.org/help/)                        | Quick reference and interactive tutorial for learning Markdown. |\n| [CommonMark Spec](http://spec.commonmark.org/)                        | CommonMark Markdown Specification |\n| [daringfireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) | Syntax documentation the Markdown creator |\n\n\n#### Links to files that contains spaces\nMost Markdown applications use URL encoding for links, so does Markor. This means replace every space` ` with `%20`. This ensures that your Markdown content is compatible with most other Markdown applications.<br/><br/>\n\nMarkor has a dedicated button for adding links and file references, which automatically applies this appropiate format.  Take a look at this [video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6735650/63089879-e6aa9400-bf48-11e9-87c1-78a1ba1c444f.gif) to find out where the file reference button is located and how to use it.<br/><br/>\n\nExample: `[alt](my cool file.md)` ⮕ `[alt](my%20cool%20file.md)`.\n\n#### Can I use Markor in class to write down equations? (Math)\nYes, Markor has advanced functionalities for math! Enable the feature by checking Settings»Format»Markdown»Math.<br/><br/>\n\nMarkor's [markdown-reference.md](samples/markor-markdown-reference.md) template (available from new file dialog) showcases some examples.  \nLearn more about available functions and symbols here: [1](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html), [2](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html)\n\n\n## Format: todo.txt\n#### What is todo.txt?\nTodo.txt is a simple text format for todo. Each line of text is a task. The idea comes from [Gina Trapani](https://github.com/ginatrapani).\n\n| **Resources** | |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| [Homepage](http://todotxt.org/)                                                       | Todo.txt's home      |\n| [Format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt/blob/master/README.md)                   | Syntax documentation |\n| [User Documentation](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli/wiki/User-Documentation) | User documentation   |\n\n\n![todotxt](doc/assets/todotxt-format-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n![todotxt](doc/assets/todotxt-format.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n\n#### How to mark a task done?\nDone tasks are marked by a `x ` in begining of the line and can optionally be moved to a done/archive file.\n\n#### What is a context (@)?\n  With contexts you can mark a situation or place. You may use it to categorize your todos.

This modality is much faster as it doesn't have the browser overhead. Still, it analyzes HTTP responses body as is, without any javascript or DOM rendering, potentially missing post-dom-rendered endpoints or asynchronous endpoint calls that might happen in complex web applications depending, for example, on browser-specific events.\n\n### Headless Mode\n\nHeadless mode hooks internal headless calls to handle HTTP requests/responses directly within the browser context. This offers two advantages:\n- The HTTP fingerprint (TLS and user agent) fully identify the client as a legitimate browser\n- Better coverage since the endpoints are discovered analyzing the standard raw response, as in the previous modality, and also the browser-rendered one with javascript enabled.\n\nHeadless crawling is optional and can be enabled using `-headless` option.\n\nHere are other headless CLI options -\n\n```console\nkatana -h headless\n\nFlags:\nHEADLESS:\n   -hl, -headless                    enable headless hybrid crawling (experimental)\n   -sc, -system-chrome               use local installed chrome browser instead of katana installed\n   -sb, -show-browser                show the browser on the screen with headless mode\n   -ho, -headless-options string[]   start headless chrome with additional options\n   -nos, -no-sandbox                 start headless chrome in --no-sandbox mode\n   -cdd, -chrome-data-dir string     path to store chrome browser data\n   -scp, -system-chrome-path string  use specified chrome browser for headless crawling\n   -noi, -no-incognito               start headless chrome without incognito mode\n   -cwu, -chrome-ws-url string       use chrome browser instance launched elsewhere with the debugger listening at this URL\n   -xhr, -xhr-extraction             extract xhr requests\n```\n\n*`-no-sandbox`*\n----\n\nRuns headless chrome browser with **no-sandbox** option, useful when running as root user.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -headless -no-sandbox\n```\n\n*`-no-incognito`*\n----\n\nRuns headless chrome browser without incognito mode, useful when using the local browser.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -headless -no-incognito\n```\n\n*`-headless-options`*\n----\n\nWhen crawling in headless mode, additional chrome options can be specified using `-headless-options`, for example -\n\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -headless -system-chrome -headless-options --disable-gpu,proxy-server=http://127.0.0.1:8080\n```\n\n\n## Scope Control\n\nCrawling can be endless if not scoped, as such katana comes with multiple support to define the crawl scope.\n\n*`-field-scope`*\n----\nMost handy option to define scope with predefined field name, `rdn` being default option for field scope.\n\n   - `rdn` - crawling scoped to root domain name and all subdomains (e.g. `*example.com`) (default)\n   - `fqdn` - crawling scoped to given sub(domain) (e.g. `www.example.com` or `api.example.com`)\n   - `dn` - crawling scoped to domain name keyword (e.g. `example`)\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -fs dn\n```\n\n\n*`-crawl-scope`*\n------\n\nFor advanced scope control, `-cs` option can be used that comes with **regex** support.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -cs login\n```\n\nFor multiple in scope rules, file input with multiline string / regex can be passed.\n\n```bash\n$ cat in_scope.txt\n\nlogin/\nadmin/\napp/\nwordpress/\n```\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -cs in_scope.txt\n```\n\n\n*`-crawl-out-scope`*\n-----\n\nFor defining what not to crawl, `-cos` option can be used and also support **regex** input.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -cos logout\n```\n\nFor multiple out of scope rules, file input with multiline string / regex can be passed.\n\n```bash\n$ cat out_of_scope.txt\n\n/logout\n/log_out\n```\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -cos out_of_scope.txt\n```\n\n*`-no-scope`*\n----\n\nKatana is default to scope `*.domain`, to disable this `-ns` option can be used and also to crawl the internet.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -ns\n```\n\n*`-display-out-scope`*\n----\n\nAs default, when scope option is used, it also applies for the links to display as output, as such **external URLs are default to exclude** and to overwrite this behavior, `-do` option can be used to display all the external URLs that exist in targets scoped URL / Endpoint.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -do\n```\n\nHere is all the CLI options for the scope control -\n\n\n```console\nkatana -h scope\n\nFlags:\nSCOPE:\n   -cs, -crawl-scope string[]       in scope url regex to be followed by crawler\n   -cos, -crawl-out-scope string[]  out of scope url regex to be excluded by crawler\n   -fs, -field-scope string         pre-defined scope field (dn,rdn,fqdn) (default \"rdn\")\n   -ns, -no-scope                   disables host based default scope\n   -do, -display-out-scope          display external endpoint from scoped crawling\n```\n\n\n## Crawler Configuration\n\nKatana comes with multiple options to configure and control the crawl as the way we want.\n\n*`-depth`*\n----\n\nOption to define the `depth` to follow the urls for crawling, the more depth the more number of endpoint being crawled + time for crawl.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -d 5\n```\n\n*`-js-crawl`*\n----\n\nOption to enable JavaScript file parsing + crawling the endpoints discovered in JavaScript files, disabled as default.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -jc\n```\n\n*`-crawl-duration`*\n----\n\nOption to predefined crawl duration, disabled as default.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -ct 2\n```\n\n*`-known-files`*\n----\nOption to enable crawling `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` file, disabled as default.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -kf robotstxt,sitemapxml\n```\n\n*`-automatic-form-fill`*\n----\n\nOption to enable automatic form filling for known / unknown fields, known field values can be customized as needed by updating form config file at `$HOME/.config/katana/form-config.yaml`.\n\nAutomatic form filling is experimental feature.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -aff\n```\n\n## Authenticated Crawling\n\nAuthenticated crawling involves including custom headers or cookies in HTTP requests to access protected resources. These headers provide authentication or authorization information, allowing you to crawl authenticated content / endpoint. You can specify headers directly in the command line or provide them as a file with katana to perform authenticated crawling.\n\n> **Note**: User needs to be manually perform the authentication and export the session cookie / header to file to use with katana.\n\n*`-headers`*\n----\n\nOption to add a custom header or cookie to the request. \n> Syntax of [headers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2) in the HTTP specification\n\nHere is an example of adding a cookie to the request:\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -H 'Cookie: usrsess=AmljNrESo'\n```\n\nIt is also possible to supply headers or cookies as a file. For example:\n\n```\n$ cat cookie.txt\n\nCookie: PHPSESSIONID=XXXXXXXXX\nX-API-KEY: XXXXX\nTOKEN=XX\n```\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -H cookie.txt\n```\n\n\nThere are more options to configure when needed, here is all the config related CLI options - \n\n```console\nkatana -h config\n\nFlags:\nCONFIGURATION:\n   -r, -resolvers string[]       list of custom resolver (file or comma separated)\n   -d, -depth int                maximum depth to crawl (default 3)\n   -jc, -js-crawl                enable endpoint parsing / crawling in javascript file\n   -ct, -crawl-duration int      maximum duration to crawl the target for\n   -kf, -known-files string      enable crawling of known files (all,robotstxt,sitemapxml)\n   -mrs, -max-response-size int  maximum response size to read (default 9223372036854775807)\n   -timeout int                  time to wait for request in seconds (default 10)\n   -aff, -automatic-form-fill    enable automatic form filling (experimental)\n   -fx, -form-extraction         enable extraction of form, input, textarea & select elements\n   -retry int                    number of times to retry the request (default 1)\n   -proxy string                 http/socks5 proxy to use\n   -H, -headers string[]         custom header/cookie to include in request\n   -config string                path to the katana configuration file\n   -fc, -form-config string      path to custom form configuration file\n   -flc, -field-config string    path to custom field configuration file\n   -s, -strategy string          Visit strategy (depth-first, breadth-first) (default \"depth-first\")\n```\n\n### Connecting to Active Browser Session\n\nKatana can also connect to active browser session where user is already logged in and authenticated. and use it for crawling. The only requirement for this is to start browser with remote debugging enabled.\n\nHere is an example of starting chrome browser with remote debugging enabled and using it with katana -\n\n**step 1) First Locate path of chrome executable**\n\n| Operating System | Chromium Executable Location | Google Chrome Executable Location |\n|------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Windows (64-bit) | `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chromium\\Application\\chrome.exe` | `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe` |\n| Windows (32-bit) | `C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chromium\\Application\\chrome.exe` | `C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe` |\n| macOS | `/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium` | `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome` |\n| Linux | `/usr/bin/chromium` | `/usr/bin/google-chrome` |\n\n**step 2) Start chrome with remote debugging enabled and it will return websocker url. For example, on MacOS, you can start chrome with remote debugging enabled using following command** -\n\n```console\n$ /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222\n\n\nDevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/c5316c9c-19d6-42dc-847a-41d1aeebf7d6\n```\n\n> Now login to the website you want to crawl and keep the browser open.\n\n**step 3) Now use the websocket url with katana to connect to the active browser session and crawl the website**\n\n```console\nkatana -headless -u https://tesla.com -cwu ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/c5316c9c-19d6-42dc-847a-41d1aeebf7d6 -no-incognito\n```\n\n> **Note**: you can use `-cdd` option to specify custom chrome data directory to store browser data and cookies but that does not save session data if cookie is set to `Session` only or expires after certain time.\n\n\n## Filters\n\n*`-field`*\n----\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Deprecated: use [**`-output-template`**](#-output-template) instead. The field flag is still supported for backward compatibility.\n\nKatana comes with built in fields that can be used to filter the output for the desired information, `-f` option can be used to specify any of the available fields.\n\n```\n   -f, -field string  field to display in output (url,path,fqdn,rdn,rurl,qurl,qpath,file,key,value,kv,dir,udir)\n```\n\nHere is a table with examples of each field and expected output when used - \n\n\n| FIELD   | DESCRIPTION                 | EXAMPLE                                                      |\n| ------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `url`   | URL Endpoint                | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/admin/login?user=admin&password=admin` |\n| `qurl`  | URL including query param   | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/admin/login.php?user=admin&password=admin` |\n| `qpath` | Path including query param  | `/login?user=admin&password=admin`                           |\n| `path`  | URL Path                    | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/admin/login`              |\n| `fqdn`  | Fully Qualified Domain name | `admin.projectdiscovery.io`                                  |\n| `rdn`   | Root Domain name            | `projectdiscovery.io`                                        |\n| `rurl`  | Root URL                    | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io`                          |\n| `ufile` | URL with File               | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/login.js`                 |\n| `file`  | Filename in URL             | `login.php`                                                  |\n| `key`   | Parameter keys in URL       | `user,password`                                              |\n| `value` | Parameter values in URL     | `admin,admin`                                                |\n| `kv`    | Keys=Values in URL          | `user=admin&password=admin`                                  |\n| `dir`   | URL Directory name          | `/admin/`                                                    |\n| `udir`  | URL with Directory          | `https://admin.projectdiscovery.io/admin/`                   |\n\nHere is an example of using field option to only display all the urls with query parameter in it -\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -f qurl -silent\n\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/en_au?redirect=no\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/en_nz?redirect=no\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/product/men_s-raven-lightweight-zip-up-bomber-jacket?sku=1740250-00-A\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/product/tesla-shop-gift-card?sku=1767247-00-A\nhttps://shop.tesla.com/product/men_s-chill-crew-neck-sweatshirt?sku=1740176-00-A\nhttps://www.tesla.com/about?redirect=no\nhttps://www.tesla.com/about/legal?redirect=no\nhttps://www.tesla.com/findus/list?redirect=no\n```\n\n### Custom Fields\n\nYou can create custom fields to extract and store specific information from page responses using regex rules. These custom fields are defined using a YAML config file and are loaded from the default location at `$HOME/.config/katana/field-config.yaml`. Alternatively, you can use the `-flc` option to load a custom field config file from a different location.\nHere is example custom field.\n\n```yaml\n- name: email\n  type: regex\n  regex:\n  - '([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)'\n  - '([a-zA-Z0-9+._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)'\n\n- name: phone\n  type: regex\n  regex:\n  - '\\d{3}-\\d{8}|\\d{4}-\\d{7}'\n```\n\nWhen defining custom fields, following attributes are supported:\n\n- **name** (required)\n\n> The value of **name** attribute is used as the `-field` cli option value.\n\n- **type** (required)\n\n> The type of custom attribute, currently supported option - `regex` \n\n- **part** (optional)\n\n> The part of the response to extract the information from. The default value is `response`, which includes both the header and body. Other possible values are `header` and `body`.\n\n- group (optional)\n\n> You can use this attribute to select a specific matched group in regex, for example: `group: 1`\n\n#### Running katana using custom field:\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -f email,phone\n```\n\n*`-store-field`*\n---\n\nTo compliment `field` option which is useful to filter output at run time, there is `-sf, -store-fields` option which works exactly like field option except instead of filtering, it stores all the information on the disk under `katana_field` directory sorted by target url. Use `-sfd` or `-store-field-dir` to store data in a different location.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -sf key,fqdn,qurl -silent\n```\n\n```bash\n$ ls katana_field/\n\nhttps_www.tesla.com_fqdn.txt\nhttps_www.tesla.com_key.txt\nhttps_www.tesla.com_qurl.txt\n```\n\nThe `-store-field` option can be useful for collecting information to build a targeted wordlist for various purposes, including but not limited to:\n\n- Identifying the most commonly used parameters\n- Discovering frequently used paths\n- Finding commonly used files\n- Identifying related or unknown subdomains\n\n### Katana Filters\n\n*`-extension-match`*\n---\n\nCrawl output can be easily matched for specific extension using `-em` option to ensure to display only output containing given extension.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -silent -em js,jsp,json\n```\n\n*`-extension-filter`*\n---\n\nCrawl output can be easily filtered for specific extension using `-ef` option which ensure to remove all the urls containing given extension.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -silent -ef css,txt,md\n\n```\n*`-no-default-ext-filter`*\n---\n\nKatana filters several extensions by default. This can be disabled with the `-ndef` option.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -silent -ndef\n```\n\n*`-match-regex`*\n---\nThe `-match-regex` or `-mr` flag allows you to filter output URLs using regular expressions. When using this flag, only URLs that match the specified regular expression will be printed in the output.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -mr 'https://shop\\.tesla\\.com/*' -silent\n```\n*`-filter-regex`*\n---\nThe `-filter-regex` or `-fr` flag allows you to filter output URLs using regular expressions. When using this flag, it will skip the URLs that are match the specified regular expression.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -fr 'https://www\\.tesla\\.com/*' -silent\n```\n\n### Advance Filtering\n\nKatana supports DSL-based expressions for advanced matching and filtering capabilities:\n\n- To match endpoints with a 200 status code:\n```shell\nkatana -u https://www.hackerone.com -mdc 'status_code == 200'\n```\n- To match endpoints that contain \"default\" and have a status code other than 403:\n```shell\nkatana -u https://www.hackerone.com -mdc 'contains(endpoint, \"default\") && status_code != 403'\n```\n- To match endpoints with PHP technologies:\n```shell\nkatana -u https://www.hackerone.com -mdc 'contains(to_lower(technologies), \"php\")'\n```\n- To filter out endpoints running on Cloudflare:\n```shell\nkatana -u https://www.hackerone.com -fdc 'contains(to_lower(technologies), \"cloudflare\")'\n```\nDSL functions can be applied to any keys in the jsonl output. For more information on available DSL functions, please visit the [dsl project](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/dsl).\n\nHere are additional filter options -\n\n```console\nkatana -h filter\n\nFlags:\nFILTER:\n   -mr, -match-regex string[]             regex or list of regex to match on output url (cli, file)\n   -fr, -filter-regex string[]            regex or list of regex to filter on output url (cli, file)\n   -f, -field string                      field to display in output (url,path,fqdn,rdn,rurl,qurl,qpath,file,ufile,key,value,kv,dir,udir)\n   -sf, -store-field string               field to store in per-host output (url,path,fqdn,rdn,rurl,qurl,qpath,file,ufile,key,value,kv,dir,udir)\n   -em, -extension-match string[]         match output for given extension (eg, -em php,html,js)\n   -ef, -extension-filter string[]        filter output for given extension (eg, -ef png,css)\n   -ndef, -no-default-ext-filter bool     remove default extensions from the filter list\n   -mdc, -match-condition string          match response with dsl based condition\n   -fdc, -filter-condition string         filter response with dsl based condition\n   -duf, -disable-unique-filter           disable duplicate content filtering\n```\n\n\n## Rate Limit\n\nIt's easy to get blocked / banned while crawling if not following target websites limits, katana comes with multiple option to tune the crawl to go as fast / slow we want.\n\n*`-delay`*\n-----\n\noption to introduce a delay in seconds between each new request katana makes while crawling, disabled as default.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -delay 20\n```\n\n*`-concurrency`*\n-----\noption to control the number of urls per target to fetch at the same time.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -c 20\n```\n\n\n*`-parallelism`*\n-----\noption to define number of target to process at same time from list input.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -p 20\n```\n\n*`-rate-limit`*\n-----\noption to use to define max number of request can go out per second.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -rl 100\n```\n\n*`-rate-limit-minute`*\n-----\noption to use to define max number of request can go out per minute.\n\n```\nkatana -u https://tesla.com -rlm 500\n```\n\nHere is all long / short CLI options for rate limit control -\n\n```console\nkatana -h rate-limit\n\nFlags:\nRATE-LIMIT:\n   -c, -concurrency int          number of concurrent fetchers to use (default 10)\n   -p, -parallelism int          number of concurrent inputs to process (default 10)\n   -rd, -delay int               request delay between each request in seconds\n   -rl, -rate-limit int          maximum requests to send per second (default 150)\n   -rlm, -rate-limit-minute int  maximum number of requests to send per minute\n```\n\n## Output\n\nKatana support both file output in plain text format as well as JSON which includes additional information like, `source`, `tag`, and `attribute` name to co-related the discovered endpoint.\n\n*`-output`*\n---\n\nBy default, katana outputs the crawled endpoints in plain text format. The results can be written to a file by using the -output option.\n\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://example.com -no-scope -output example_endpoints.txt\n```\n\n*`-output-template`*\n---\n\nThe `-output-template` option allows you to customize the output format using template, providing flexibility in defining the output structure. This option replaces the deprecated `-field` flag for filtering output. Instead of relying on predefined fields, you can specify a custom template directly in the command line to control how the extracted data is presented.\n\nExample of using the `-output-template` option:\n\n```sh\nkatana -u https://example.com -output-template '{{email}} - {{url}}'\n```\n\nIn this example, `email` represents a [custom field](#custom-fields) that extracts and displays email addresses found within the source `url`.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If a specified field does not exist or does not contain a value, it will simply be omitted from the output.\n\nThis option can effectively structure the output in a way that best suits your use case, making data extraction more intuitive and customizable.\n\n*`-jsonl`*\n---\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://example.com -jsonl | jq .\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2023-03-20T16:23:58.027559+05:30\",\n  \"request\": {\n    \"method\": \"GET\",\n    \"endpoint\": \"https://example.com\",\n    \"raw\": \"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: example.com\\r\\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 11_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.88 Safari/537.36\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\n  },\n  \"response\": {\n    \"status_code\": 200,\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"accept_ranges\": \"bytes\",\n      \"expires\": \"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 10:53:58 GMT\",\n      \"last_modified\": \"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:18:26 GMT\",\n      \"content_type\": \"text/html; charset=UTF-8\",\n      \"server\": \"ECS (dcb/7EA3)\",\n      \"vary\": \"Accept-Encoding\",\n      \"etag\": \"\\\"3147526947\\\"\",\n      \"cache_control\": \"max-age=604800\",\n      \"x_cache\": \"HIT\",\n      \"date\": \"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 10:53:58 GMT\",\n      \"age\": \"331239\"\n    },\n    \"body\": \"<!doctype html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n    <title>Example Domain</title>\\n\\n    <meta charset=\\\"utf-8\\\" />\\n    <meta http-equiv=\\\"Content-type\\\" content=\\\"text/html; charset=utf-8\\\" />\\n    <meta name=\\\"viewport\\\" content=\\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\\\" />\\n    <style type=\\\"text/css\\\">\\n    body {\\n        background-color: #f0f0f2;\\n        margin: 0;\\n        padding: 0;\\n        font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, \\\"Segoe UI\\\", \\\"Open Sans\\\", \\\"Helvetica Neue\\\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\\n        \\n    }\\n    div {\\n        width: 600px;\\n        margin: 5em auto;\\n        padding: 2em;\\n        background-color: #fdfdff;\\n        border-radius: 0.5em;\\n        box-shadow: 2px 3px 7px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.02);\\n    }\\n    a:link, a:visited {\\n        color: #38488f;\\n        text-decoration: none;\\n    }\\n    @media (max-width: 700px) {\\n        div {\\n            margin: 0 auto;\\n            width: auto;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    </style>    \\n</head>\\n\\n<body>\\n<div>\\n    <h1>Example Domain</h1>\\n    <p>This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents.

When this option is used, text files including the request and response will be written to the **katana_response** directory. If you would like to specify a custom directory, you can use the `-store-response-dir` option.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://example.com -no-scope -store-response\n```\n\n```bash\n$ cat katana_response/index.txt\n\nkatana_response/example.com/327c3fda87ce286848a574982ddd0b7c7487f816.txt https://example.com (200 OK)\nkatana_response/www.iana.org/bfc096e6dd93b993ca8918bf4c08fdc707a70723.txt http://www.iana.org/domains/reserved (200 OK)\n```\n\n**Note:**\n\n*`-store-response` option is not supported in `-headless` mode.*\n\n*`-list-output-fields`*\n----\n\nThe `-list-output-fields` or `-lof` flag displays all available fields that can be used in JSONL output format. This is useful for understanding what data is available when using custom output templates or when excluding specific fields.\n\n```console\nkatana -lof\n```\n\n*`-exclude-output-fields`*\n----\n\nThe `-exclude-output-fields` or `-eof` flag allows you to exclude specific fields from the JSONL output. This is useful for reducing output size or focusing on specific data by removing unwanted fields.\n\n```console\nkatana -u https://example.com -jsonl -eof raw,body\n```\n\nHere are additional CLI options related to output -\n\n```console\nkatana -h output\n\nOUTPUT:\n   -o, -output string                file to write output to\n   -sr, -store-response              store http requests/responses\n   -srd, -store-response-dir string  store http requests/responses to custom directory\n   -lof, -list-output-fields         list available fields for jsonl output format\n   -eof, -exclude-output-fields      exclude fields from jsonl output\n   -j, -json                         write output in JSONL(ines) format\n   -nc, -no-color                    disable output content coloring (ANSI escape codes)\n   -silent                           display output only\n   -v, -verbose                      display verbose output\n   -version                          display project version\n```\n\n## Katana as a library\n`katana` can be used as a library by creating an instance of the `Option` struct and populating it with the same options that would be specified via CLI. Using the options you can create `crawlerOptions` and so standard or hybrid `crawler`.\n`crawler.Crawl` method should be called to crawl the input.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"math\"\n\n\t\"github.com/projectdiscovery/gologger\"\n\t\"github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/pkg/engine/standard\"\n\t\"github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/pkg/output\"\n\t\"github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/pkg/types\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\toptions := &types.Options{\n\t\tMaxDepth:     3,             // Maximum depth to crawl\n\t\tFieldScope:   \"rdn\",         // Crawling Scope Field\n\t\tBodyReadSize: math.MaxInt,   // Maximum response size to read\n\t\tTimeout:      10,            // Timeout is the time to wait for request in seconds\n\t\tConcurrency:  10,            // Concurrency is the number of concurrent crawling goroutines\n\t\tParallelism:  10,            // Parallelism is the number of urls processing goroutines\n\t\tDelay:        0,             // Delay is the delay between each crawl requests in seconds\n\t\tRateLimit:    150,           // Maximum requests to send per second\n\t\tStrategy:     \"depth-first\", // Visit strategy (depth-first, breadth-first)\n\t\tOnResult: func(result output.Result) { // Callback function to execute for result\n\t\t\tgologger.Info().Msg(result.Request.URL)\n\t\t},\n\t}\n\tcrawlerOptions, err := types.NewCrawlerOptions(options)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tgologger.Fatal().Msg(err.Error())\n\t}\n\tdefer crawlerOptions.Close()\n\tcrawler, err := standard.New(crawlerOptions)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tgologger.Fatal().Msg(err.Error())\n\t}\n\tdefer crawler.Close()\n\tvar input = \"https://www.hackerone.com\"\n\terr = crawler.Crawl(input)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tgologger.Warning().Msgf(\"Could not crawl %s: %s\", input, err.Error())\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Reporting Issues & Feature Requests\n\nTo maintain issue tracking and improve triage efficiency:\n\n**All reports start as [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/discussions)**\n\n- **Bug Reports** → [Start a Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/discussions/new?category=q-a)\n- **Feature Requests** → [Start an Ideas Discussion](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/discussions/new?category=ideas)  \n- **Questions** → [Start a Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/discussions/new?category=q-a)\n\n**Why Discussions First?**\n- **Community can help** with quick questions and troubleshooting\n- **Better triage** - confirmed bugs/features become tracked issues  \n- **Cleaner issue tracker** - focus on actionable items only\n\nMaintainers will convert discussions to issues when appropriate after proper review.\n\n--------\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\nkatana is made with ❤️ by the [projectdiscovery](https://projectdiscovery.io) team and distributed under [MIT License](LICENSE.md).\n\n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/projectdiscovery\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-burp-plugin/main/static/join-discord.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Join Discord\"></a>\n\n</div>\n",

When you don't have a public IP, you can use the free shared nodes provided by the EasyTier community. Nodes will automatically attempt NAT traversal and establish P2P connections. When P2P fails, data will be relayed through shared nodes.\n\nThe currently deployed shared public node is `tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010`.\n\nWhen using shared nodes, each node entering the network needs to provide the same `--network-name` and `--network-secret` parameters as the unique identifier of the network.\n\nTaking two nodes as an example (Please use more complex network name to avoid conflicts):\n\n1. Run on Node A:\n\n```bash\n# Run with administrator privileges\nsudo easytier-core -d --network-name abc --network-secret abc -p tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010\n```\n\n2. Run on Node B:\n\n```bash\n# Run with administrator privileges\nsudo easytier-core -d --network-name abc --network-secret abc -p tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010\n```\n\nAfter successful execution, you can check the network status using `easytier-cli`:\n\n```text\n| ipv4         | hostname       | cost  | lat_ms | loss_rate | rx_bytes | tx_bytes | tunnel_proto | nat_type | id         | version         |\n| ------------ | -------------- | ----- | ------ | --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | --------------- |\n| 10.126.126.1 | abc-1          | Local | *      | *         | *        | *        | udp          | FullCone | 439804259  | 2.5.0-70e69a38~ |\n| 10.126.126.2 | abc-2          | p2p   | 3.452  | 0         | 17.33 kB | 20.42 kB | udp          | FullCone | 390879727  | 2.5.0-70e69a38~ |\n|              | PublicServer_a | p2p   | 27.796 | 0.000     | 50.01 kB | 67.46 kB | tcp          | Unknown  | 3771642457 | 2.5.0-70e69a38~ |\n```\n\nYou can test connectivity between nodes:\n\n```bash\n# Test connectivity\nping 10.126.126.1\nping 10.126.126.2\n```\n\nNote: If you cannot ping through, it may be that the firewall is blocking incoming traffic. Please turn off the firewall or add allow rules.\n\nTo improve availability, you can connect to multiple shared nodes simultaneously:\n\n```bash\n# Connect to multiple shared nodes\nsudo easytier-core -d --network-name abc --network-secret abc -p tcp://public.easytier.cn:11010 -p udp://public.easytier.cn:11010\n```\n\nOnce your network is set up successfully, you can easily configure it to start automatically on system boot. Refer to the [One-Click Register Service guide](https://easytier.cn/en/guide/network/oneclick-install-as-service.html) for step-by-step instructions on registering EasyTier as a system service.\n\n#### Decentralized Networking\n\nEasyTier is fundamentally decentralized, with no distinction between server and client. As long as one device can communicate with any node in the virtual network, it can join the virtual network. Here's how to set up a decentralized network:\n\n1. Start First Node (Node A):\n\n```bash\n# Start the first node\nsudo easytier-core -i 10.144.144.1\n```\n\nAfter startup, this node will listen on the following ports by default:\n- TCP: 11010\n- UDP: 11010\n- WebSocket: 11011\n- WebSocket SSL: 11012\n- WireGuard: 11013\n\n2. Connect Second Node (Node B):\n\n```bash\n# Connect to the first node using its public IP\nsudo easytier-core -i 10.144.144.2 -p udp://FIRST_NODE_PUBLIC_IP:11010\n```\n\n3. Verify Connection:\n\n```bash\n# Test connectivity\nping 10.144.144.2\n\n# View connected peers\neasytier-cli peer\n\n# View routing information\neasytier-cli route\n\n# View local node information\neasytier-cli node\n```\n\nFor more nodes to join the network, they can connect to any existing node in the network using the `-p` parameter:\n\n```bash\n# Connect to any existing node using its public IP\nsudo easytier-core -i 10.144.144.3 -p udp://ANY_EXISTING_NODE_PUBLIC_IP:11010\n```\n\n### 🔍 Advanced Features\n\n#### Subnet Proxy\n\nAssuming the network topology is as follows, Node B wants to share its accessible subnet 10.1.1.0/24 with other nodes:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n\nsubgraph Node A Public IP 22.1.1.1\nnodea[EasyTier<br/>10.144.144.1]\nend\n\nsubgraph Node B\nnodeb[EasyTier<br/>10.144.144.2]\nend\n\nid1[[10.1.1.0/24]]\n\nnodea <--> nodeb <-.-> id1\n```\n\nTo share a subnet, add the `-n` parameter when starting EasyTier:\n\n```bash\n# Share subnet 10.1.1.0/24 with other nodes\nsudo easytier-core -i 10.144.144.2 -n 10.1.1.0/24\n```\n\nSubnet proxy information will automatically sync to each node in the virtual network, and each node will automatically configure the corresponding route. You can verify the subnet proxy setup:\n\n1. Check if the routing information has been synchronized (the proxy_cidrs column shows the proxied subnets):\n\n```bash\n# View routing information\neasytier-cli route\n```\n\n![Routing Information](/assets/image-3.png)\n\n2. Test if you can access nodes in the proxied subnet:\n\n```bash\n# Test connectivity to proxied subnet\nping 10.1.1.2\n```\n\n#### WireGuard Integration\n\nEasyTier can act as a WireGuard server, allowing any device with a WireGuard client (including iOS and Android) to access the EasyTier network. Here's an example setup:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n\nios[[iPhone<br/>WireGuard Installed]]\n\nsubgraph Node A Public IP 22.1.1.1\nnodea[EasyTier<br/>10.144.144.1]\nend\n\nsubgraph Node B\nnodeb[EasyTier<br/>10.144.144.2]\nend\n\nid1[[10.1.1.0/24]]\n\nios <-.-> nodea <--> nodeb <-.-> id1\n```\n\n1. Start EasyTier with WireGuard portal enabled:\n\n```bash\n# Listen on 0.0.0.0:11013 and use 10.14.14.0/24 subnet for WireGuard clients\nsudo easytier-core -i 10.144.144.1 --vpn-portal wg://0.0.0.0:11013/10.14.14.0/24\n```\n\n2. Get WireGuard client configuration:\n\n```bash\n# Get WireGuard client configuration\neasytier-cli vpn-portal\n```\n\n3. In the output configuration:\n   - Set `Interface.Address` to an available IP from the WireGuard subnet\n   - Set `Peer.Endpoint` to the public IP/domain of your EasyTier node\n   - Import the modified configuration into your WireGuard client\n\n#### Self-Hosted Public Shared Node\n\nYou can run your own public shared node to help other nodes discover each other. A public shared node is just a regular EasyTier network (with same network name and secret) that other networks can connect to.\n\nTo run a public shared node:\n\n```bash\n# No need to specify IPv4 address for public shared nodes\nsudo easytier-core --network-name mysharednode --network-secret mysharednode\n```\n\n## Related Projects\n\n- [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/): A global virtual network for connecting devices.\n- [TailScale](https://tailscale.com/): A VPN solution aimed at simplifying network configuration.\n\n### Contact Us\n\n- 💬 **[Telegram Group](https://t.me/easytier)**\n- 👥 **[QQ Group]**\n  - No.1 [949700262](https://qm.qq.com/q/wFoTUChqZW)\n  - No.2 [837676408](https://qm.qq.com/q/4V33DrfgHe)\n  - No.3 [957189589](https://qm.qq.com/q/YNyTQjwlai)\n\n## License\n\nEasyTier is released under the [LGPL-3.0](https://github.com/EasyTier/EasyTier/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n## Sponsor\n\nCDN acceleration and security protection for this project are sponsored by Tencent EdgeOne.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://edgeone.ai/?from=github\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"assets/edgeone.png\" width=\"200\" alt=\"EdgeOne Logo\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\nSpecial thanks to [Langlang Cloud](https://langlangy.cn/?i26c5a5)  and [RainCloud](https://www.rainyun.com/NjM0NzQ1_) for sponsoring our public servers.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://langlangy.cn/?i26c5a5\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"assets/langlang.png\" width=\"200\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://langlangy.cn/?i26c5a5\" target=\"_blank\">\n<img src=\"assets/raincloud.png\" width=\"200\">\n</a>\n</p>\n\n\nIf you find EasyTier helpful, please consider sponsoring us.

Make sure you don't skip sections if this is your first visit, as there might be important details in there for you.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with **Zigbee** terminology make sure you [read this](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/zigbee/01_zigbee_network.html) to help you out.\n\n## [Integrations](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/usage/integrations.html)\n\nZigbee2MQTT integrates well with (almost) every home automation solution because it uses MQTT. However the following integrations are worth mentioning:\n\n### [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)\n\n<img align=\"left\" height=\"75px\" width=\"75px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7738048/40914297-49e6e560-6800-11e8-8904-36cce896e5a8.png\">\n\n<br clear=\"right\">\n\n[Home Assistant OS](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) using [the official addon](https://github.com/zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt) ([other installations](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/usage/integrations/home_assistant.html))\n\n<br clear=\"both\">\n\n### [Homey](https://homey.app/)\n\n<img align=\"left\" height=\"75px\" width=\"75px\" src=\"https://etc.athom.com/logo/white/256.png\">\n\n<br clear=\"right\">\n\nIntegration implemented in the [Homey App](https://homey.app/nl-nl/app/com.gruijter.zigbee2mqtt/) ([documentation & support](https://community.homey.app/t/83214))\n\n<br clear=\"both\">\n\n### [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/)\n\n<img align=\"left\" height=\"75px\" width=\"75px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2734836/47615848-b8dd8700-dabd-11e8-9d77-175002dd8987.png\">\n\n<br clear=\"right\">\n\nIntegration implemented in Domoticz ([documentation](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Zigbee2MQTT)).\n\n<br clear=\"both\">\n\n### [Gladys Assistant](https://gladysassistant.com/)\n\n<img align=\"left\" height=\"75px\" width=\"75px\" src=\"./images/gladys-assistant-logo.jpg\">\n\n<br clear=\"right\">\n\nIntegration implemented natively in Gladys Assistant ([documentation](https://gladysassistant.com/docs/integrations/zigbee2mqtt/)).\n\n<br clear=\"both\">\n\n### [IoBroker](https://www.iobroker.net/)\n\n<img align=\"left\" height=\"75px\" width=\"75px\" src=\"https://forum.iobroker.net/assets/uploads/system/site-logo.png\">\n\n<br clear=\"right\">\n\nIntegration implemented in IoBroker ([documentation](https://github.com/o0shojo0o/ioBroker.zigbee2mqtt)).\n\n<br clear=\"both\">\n\n## Architecture\n\n![Architecture](images/architecture-new.png)\n\n### Internal Architecture\n\nZigbee2MQTT is made up of three modules, each developed in its own Github project. Starting from the hardware (adapter) and moving up; [zigbee-herdsman](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee-herdsman) connects to your adapter to handle Zigbee communication and makes an API available to the higher levels of the stack. For e.g. Texas Instruments hardware, zigbee-herdsman uses the [TI zStack monitoring and test API](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/wiki/References#texas-instruments-zstack) to communicate with the adapter. The module [zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters) handles the mapping from individual device models to the Zigbee clusters they support. [Zigbee clusters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/wiki/References#csa-zigbee-alliance-spec) are the layers of the Zigbee protocol on top of the base protocol that define things like how lights, sensors and switches talk to each other over the Zigbee network. Finally, the Zigbee2MQTT module drives zigbee-herdsman and maps the zigbee messages to MQTT messages. Zigbee2MQTT also keeps track of the state of the system. It uses a `database.db` file to store this state; a text file with a JSON database of connected devices and their capabilities. Zigbee2MQTT provides several web-based interfaces ([zigbee2mqtt-frontend](https://github.com/nurikk/zigbee2mqtt-frontend), [zigbee2mqtt-windfront](https://github.com/Nerivec/zigbee2mqtt-windfront)) that allows monitoring and configuration.\n\n### Developing\n\nZigbee2MQTT uses TypeScript. Therefore after making changes to files in the `lib/` directory you need to recompile Zigbee2MQTT. This can be done by executing `pnpm run build`. For faster development instead of running `pnpm run build` you can run `pnpm run build:watch` in another terminal session, this will recompile as you change files.\n\nBefore running any of the commands, you'll first need to run `pnpm install --include=dev`.\nBefore submitting changes run `pnpm run check:w` then `pnpm run test:coverage`.\n\n## Supported devices\n\nSee [Supported devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices) to check whether your device is supported. There is quite an extensive list, including devices from vendors like [Xiaomi](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=Xiaomi), [Ikea](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=IKEA), [Philips](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=Philips), [OSRAM](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=OSRAM) and more.\n\nIf it's not listed in [Supported devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices), support can be added (fairly) easily, see [How to support new devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/advanced/support-new-devices/01_support_new_devices.html).\n\n## Support & help\n\nIf you need assistance you can check [opened issues](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues). Feel free to help with Pull Requests when you were able to fix things or add new devices or just share the love on social media.\n",

In this context, secret refers to a credential a machine uses to authenticate itself to another machine. This includes API keys, database passwords, private encryption keys, and more.\n\n## Discovery 🔍\n\nTruffleHog can look for secrets in many places including Git, chats, wikis, logs, API testing platforms, object stores, filesystems and more.\n\n## Classification 📁\n\nTruffleHog classifies over 800 secret types, mapping them back to the specific identity they belong to. Is it an AWS secret? Stripe secret? Cloudflare secret? Postgres password? SSL Private key? Sometimes it's hard to tell looking at it, so TruffleHog classifies everything it finds.\n\n## Validation ✅\n\nFor every secret TruffleHog can classify, it can also log in to confirm if that secret is live or not. This step is critical to know if there’s an active present danger or not.\n\n## Analysis 🔬\n\nFor the 20 some of the most commonly leaked out credential types, instead of sending one request to check if the secret can log in, TruffleHog can send many requests to learn everything there is to know about the secret. Who created it? What resources can it access? What permissions does it have on those resources?\n\n# :loudspeaker: Join Our Community\n\nHave questions? Feedback?

Download the artifact files you want, and the following files from the [releases](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/releases) page.\n\n   - trufflehog\\_{version}\\_checksums.txt\n   - trufflehog\\_{version}\\_checksums.txt.pem\n   - trufflehog\\_{version}\\_checksums.txt.sig\n\n2. Verify the signature:\n\n   ```shell\n   cosign verify-blob <path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt> \\\n   --certificate <path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.pem> \\\n   --signature <path to trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt.sig> \\\n   --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github\\.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/\\.github/workflows/.+' \\\n   --certificate-oidc-issuer \"https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\"\n   ```\n\n3. Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:\n\n   ```shell\n   sha256sum --ignore-missing -c trufflehog_{version}_checksums.txt\n   ```\n\nReplace `{version}` with the downloaded files version\n\nAlternatively, if you are using the installation script, pass `-v` option to perform signature verification.\nThis requires Cosign binary to be installed prior to running the installation script.\n\n# :rocket: Quick Start\n\n## 1: Scan a repo for only verified secrets\n\nCommand:\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog git https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys --results=verified\n```\n\nExpected output:\n\n```\n🐷🔑🐷  TruffleHog.

For example [test keys](git@github.com:trufflesecurity/test_keys.git) repo.\n```bash\n$ git clone git@github.com:trufflesecurity/test_keys.git\n```\n\nRun trufflehog from the parent directory (outside the git repo).\n```bash\n$ trufflehog git file://test_keys --results=verified,unknown\n```\n\nTo guard against malicious git configs in local scanning (see CVE-2025-41390), TruffleHog clones local git repositories to a temporary directory prior to scanning. This follows [Git's security best practices](https://git-scm.com/docs/git#_security). If you want to specify a custom path to clone the repository to (instead of tmp), you can use the `--clone-path` flag. If you'd like to skip the local cloning process and scan the repository directly (only do this for trusted repos), you can use the `--trust-local-git-config` flag.\n\n## 10: Scan GCS buckets for only verified secrets\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog gcs --project-id=<project-ID> --cloud-environment --results=verified\n```\n\n## 11: Scan a Docker image for only verified secrets\n\nUse the `--image` flag multiple times to scan multiple images.\n\n```bash\n# to scan from a remote registry\ntrufflehog docker --image trufflesecurity/secrets --results=verified\n\n# to scan from the local docker daemon\ntrufflehog docker --image docker://new_image:tag --results=verified\n\n# to scan from an image saved as a tarball\ntrufflehog docker --image file://path_to_image.tar --results=verified\n```\n\n## 12: Scan in CI\n\nSet the `--since-commit` flag to your default branch that people merge into (ex: \"main\"). Set the `--branch` flag to your PR's branch name (ex: \"feature-1\"). Depending on the CI/CD platform you use, this value can be pulled in dynamically (ex: [CIRCLE_BRANCH in Circle CI](https://circleci.com/docs/variables/) and [TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST_BRANCH in Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/)). If the repo is cloned and the target branch is already checked out during the CI/CD workflow, then `--branch HEAD` should be sufficient. The `--fail` flag will return an 183 error code if valid credentials are found.\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog git file://. --since-commit main --branch feature-1 --results=verified,unknown --fail\n```\n\n## 13: Scan a Postman workspace\n\nUse the `--workspace-id`, `--collection-id`, `--environment` flags multiple times to scan multiple targets.\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog postman --token=<postman api token> --workspace-id=<workspace id>\n```\n\n## 14: Scan a Jenkins server\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog jenkins --url https://jenkins.example.com --username admin --password admin\n```\n\n## 15: Scan an Elasticsearch server\n\n### Scan a Local Cluster\n\nThere are two ways to authenticate to a local cluster with TruffleHog: (1) username and password, (2) service token.\n\n#### Connect to a local cluster with username and password\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --username truffle --password hog\n```\n\n#### Connect to a local cluster with a service token\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog elasticsearch --nodes 192.168.14.3 192.168.14.4 --service-token ‘AAEWVaWM...Rva2VuaSDZ’\n```\n\n### Scan an Elastic Cloud Cluster\n\nTo scan a cluster on Elastic Cloud, you’ll need a Cloud ID and API key.\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog elasticsearch \\\n  --cloud-id 'search-prod:dXMtY2Vx...YjM1ODNlOWFiZGRlNjI0NA==' \\\n  --api-key 'MlVtVjBZ...ZSYlduYnF1djh3NG5FQQ=='\n```\n\n## 16. Scan a GitHub Repository for Cross Fork Object References and Deleted Commits\n\nThe following command will enumerate deleted and hidden commits on a GitHub repository and then scan them for secrets. This is an alpha release feature.\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog github-experimental --repo https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO>.git --object-discovery\n```\n\nIn addition to the normal TruffleHog output, the `--object-discovery` flag creates two files in a new `$HOME/.trufflehog` directory: `valid_hidden.txt` and `invalid.txt`. These are used to track state during commit enumeration, as well as to provide users with a complete list of all hidden and deleted commits (`valid_hidden.txt`). If you'd like to automatically remove these files after scanning, please add the flag `--delete-cached-data`.\n\n**Note**: Enumerating all valid commits on a repository using this method takes between 20 minutes and a few hours, depending on the size of your repository. We added a progress bar to keep you updated on how long the enumeration will take. The actual secret scanning runs extremely fast.\n\nFor more information on Cross Fork Object References, please [read our blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github).\n\n## 17. Scan Hugging Face\n\n### Scan a Hugging Face Model, Dataset or Space\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog huggingface --model <model_id> --space <space_id> --dataset <dataset_id>\n```\n\n### Scan all Models, Datasets and Spaces belonging to a Hugging Face Organization or User\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog huggingface --org <orgname> --user <username>\n```\n\n(Optionally) When scanning an organization or user, you can skip an entire class of resources with `--skip-models`, `--skip-datasets`, `--skip-spaces` OR a particular resource with `--ignore-models <model_id>`, `--ignore-datasets <dataset_id>`, `--ignore-spaces <space_id>`.\n\n### Scan Discussion and PR Comments\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog huggingface --model <model_id> --include-discussions --include-prs\n```\n\n## 18. Scan stdin Input\n\n```bash\naws s3 cp s3://example/gzipped/data.gz - | gunzip -c | trufflehog stdin\n```\n\n# :question: FAQ\n\n- All I see is `🐷🔑🐷  TruffleHog. Unearth your secrets. 🐷🔑🐷` and the program exits, what gives?\n  - That means no secrets were detected\n- Why is the scan taking a long time when I scan a GitHub org\n  - Unauthenticated GitHub scans have rate limits. To improve your rate limits, include the `--token` flag with a personal access token\n- It says a private key was verified, what does that mean?\n  - A verified result means TruffleHog confirmed the credential is valid by testing it against the service's API. For private keys, we've confirmed the key can be used live for SSH or SSL authentication. Check out our Driftwood blog post to learn more [Blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood-know-if-private-keys-are-sensitive/)\n- Is there an easy way to ignore specific secrets?\n  - If the scanned source [supports line numbers](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/d6375ba92172fd830abb4247cca15e3176448c5d/pkg/engine/engine.go#L358-L365), then you can add a `trufflehog:ignore` comment on the line containing the secret to ignore that secrets.\n\n# :newspaper: What's new in v3?\n\nTruffleHog v3 is a complete rewrite in Go with many new powerful features.\n\n- We've **added over 700 credential detectors that support active verification against their respective APIs**.\n- We've also added native **support for scanning GitHub, GitLab, Docker, filesystems, S3, GCS, Circle CI and Travis CI**.\n- **Instantly verify private keys** against millions of github users and **billions** of TLS certificates using our [Driftwood](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/driftwood) technology.\n- Scan binaries, documents, and other file formats\n- Available as a GitHub Action and a pre-commit hook\n\n## What is credential verification?\n\nFor every potential credential that is detected, we've painstakingly implemented programmatic verification against the API that we think it belongs to. Verification eliminates false positives and provides three result statuses:\n\n- **verified**: Credential confirmed as valid and active by API testing\n- **unverified**: Credential detected but not confirmed valid (may be invalid, expired, or verification disabled)  \n- **unknown**: Verification attempted but failed due to errors, such as a network or API failure\n\nFor example, the [AWS credential detector](pkg/detectors/aws/aws.go) performs a `GetCallerIdentity` API call against the AWS API to verify if an AWS credential is active.\n\n# :memo: Usage\n\nTruffleHog has a sub-command for each source of data that you may want to scan:\n\n- git\n- github\n- gitlab\n- docker\n- s3\n- filesystem (files and directories)\n- syslog\n- circleci\n- travisci\n- gcs (Google Cloud Storage)\n- postman\n- jenkins\n- elasticsearch\n- stdin\n- multi-scan\n\nEach subcommand can have options that you can see with the `--help` flag provided to the sub command:\n\n```\n$ trufflehog git --help\nusage: TruffleHog git [<flags>] <uri>\n\nFind credentials in git repositories.\n\nFlags:\n  -h, --help                Show context-sensitive help (also try --help-long and --help-man).\n      --log-level=0         Logging verbosity on a scale of 0 (info) to 5 (trace). Can be disabled with \"-1\".\n      --profile             Enables profiling and sets a pprof and fgprof server on :18066.\n  -j, --json                Output in JSON format.\n      --json-legacy         Use the pre-v3.0 JSON format. Only works with git, gitlab, and github sources.\n      --github-actions      Output in GitHub Actions format.\n      --concurrency=20           Number of concurrent workers.\n      --no-verification     Don't verify the results.\n      --results=RESULTS          Specifies which type(s) of results to output: verified (confirmed valid by API), unknown (verification failed due to error), unverified (detected but not verified), filtered_unverified (unverified but would have been filtered out). Defaults to all types.\n      --allow-verification-overlap\n                                 Allow verification of similar credentials across detectors\n      --filter-unverified   Only output first unverified result per chunk per detector if there are more than one results.\n      --filter-entropy=FILTER-ENTROPY\n                                 Filter unverified results with Shannon entropy.

This option filters at the `git log` level, resulting in faster scans.\n      --since-commit=SINCE-COMMIT\n                                 Commit to start scan from.\n      --branch=BRANCH            Branch to scan.\n      --max-depth=MAX-DEPTH      Maximum depth of commits to scan.\n      --bare                Scan bare repository (e.g. useful while using in pre-receive hooks)\n\nArgs:\n  <uri>  Git repository URL. https://, file://, or ssh:// schema expected.\n```\n\nFor example, to scan a `git` repository, start with\n\n```\ntrufflehog git https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog.git\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nTruffleHog supports defining [custom regex detectors](#custom-regex-detector-alpha)\nand multiple sources in a configuration file provided via the `--config` flag.\nThe regex detectors can be used with any subcommand, while the sources defined\nin configuration are only for the `multi-scan` subcommand.\n\nThe configuration format for sources can be found on Truffle Security's\n[source configuration documentation page](https://docs.trufflesecurity.com/scan-data-for-secrets).\n\nExample GitHub source configuration and [options reference](https://docs.trufflesecurity.com/github#Fvm1I):\n\n```yaml\nsources:\n- connection:\n    '@type': type.googleapis.com/sources.GitHub\n    repositories:\n    - https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys.git\n    unauthenticated: {}\n  name: example config scan\n  type: SOURCE_TYPE_GITHUB\n  verify: true\n```\n\nYou may define multiple connections under the `sources` key (see above), and\nTruffleHog will scan all of the sources concurrently.\n\n## S3\n\nThe S3 source supports assuming IAM roles for scanning in addition to IAM users. This makes it easier for users to scan multiple AWS accounts without needing to rely on hardcoded credentials for each account.\n\nThe IAM identity that TruffleHog uses initially will need to have `AssumeRole` privileges as a principal in the [trust policy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/) of each IAM role to assume.\n\nTo scan a specific bucket using locally set credentials or instance metadata if on an EC2 instance:\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog s3 --bucket=<bucket-name>\n```\n\nTo scan a specific bucket using an assumed role:\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog s3 --bucket=<bucket-name> --role-arn=<iam-role-arn>\n```\n\nMultiple roles can be passed as separate arguments. The following command will attempt to scan every bucket each role has permissions to list in the S3 API:\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog s3 --role-arn=<iam-role-arn-1> --role-arn=<iam-role-arn-2>\n```\n\nExit Codes:\n\n- 0: No errors and no results were found.\n- 1: An error was encountered. Sources may not have completed scans.\n- 183: No errors were encountered, but results were found. Will only be returned if `--fail` flag is used.\n\n## :octocat: TruffleHog Github Action\n\n### General Usage\n\n```\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      with:\n        fetch-depth: 0\n    - name: Secret Scanning\n      uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main\n      with:\n        extra_args: --results=verified,unknown\n```\n\nIn the example config above, we're scanning for live secrets in all PRs and Pushes to `main`. Only code changes in the referenced commits are scanned. If you'd like to scan an entire branch, please see the \"Advanced Usage\" section below.\n\n### Shallow Cloning\n\nIf you're incorporating TruffleHog into a standalone workflow and aren't running any other CI/CD tooling alongside TruffleHog, then we recommend using [Shallow Cloning](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---depthltdepthgt) to speed up your workflow. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```\n...\n      - shell: bash\n        run: |\n          if [ \"${{ github.event_name }}\" == \"push\" ]; then\n            echo \"depth=$(($(jq length <<< '${{ toJson(github.event.commits) }}') + 2))\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n            echo \"branch=${{ github.ref_name }}\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n          fi\n          if [ \"${{ github.event_name }}\" == \"pull_request\" ]; then\n            echo \"depth=$((${{ github.event.pull_request.commits }}+2))\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n            echo \"branch=${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n          fi\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          ref: ${{env.branch}}\n          fetch-depth: ${{env.depth}}\n      - uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main\n        with:\n          extra_args: --results=verified,unknown\n...\n```\n\nDepending on the event type (push or PR), we calculate the number of commits present. Then we add 2, so that we can reference a base commit before our code changes. We pass that integer value to the `fetch-depth` flag in the checkout action in addition to the relevant branch. Now our checkout process should be much shorter.\n\n### Canary detection\n\nTruffleHog statically detects [https://canarytokens.org/](https://canarytokens.org/).\n\n![image](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/assets/52866392/74ace530-08c5-4eaf-a169-84a73e328f6f)\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\n```yaml\n- name: TruffleHog\n  uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main\n  with:\n    # Repository path\n    path:\n    # Start scanning from here (usually main branch).\n    base:\n    # Scan commits until here (usually dev branch).\n    head: # optional\n    # Extra args to be passed to the trufflehog cli.\n    extra_args: --log-level=2 --results=verified,unknown\n```\n\nIf you'd like to specify specific `base` and `head` refs, you can use the `base` argument (`--since-commit` flag in TruffleHog CLI) and the `head` argument (`--branch` flag in the TruffleHog CLI). We only recommend using these arguments for very specific use cases, where the default behavior does not work.\n\n#### Advanced Usage: Scan entire branch\n\n```\n- name: scan-push\n        uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main\n        with:\n          base: \"\"\n          head: ${{ github.ref_name }}\n          extra_args: --results=verified,unknown\n```\n\n## TruffleHog GitLab CI\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```yaml\nstages:\n  - security\n\nsecurity-secrets:\n  stage: security\n  allow_failure: false\n  image: alpine:latest\n  variables:\n    SCAN_PATH: \".\" # Set the relative path in the repo to scan\n  before_script:\n    - apk add --no-cache git curl jq\n    - curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin\n  script:\n    - trufflehog filesystem \"$SCAN_PATH\" --results=verified,unknown --fail --json | jq\n  rules:\n    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == \"merge_request_event\"'\n```\n\nIn the example pipeline above, we're scanning for live secrets in all repository directories and files. This job runs only when the pipeline source is a merge request event, meaning it's triggered when a new merge request is created.\n\n## Pre-commit Hook\n\nTruffleHog can be used in a pre-commit hook to prevent credentials from leaking before they ever leave your computer.\n\nSee the [pre-commit hook documentation](PreCommit.md) for more information.\n\n## Custom Regex Detector (alpha)\n\nTruffleHog supports detection and verification of custom regular expressions.\nFor detection, at least one **regular expression** and **keyword** is required.\nA **keyword** is a fixed literal string identifier that appears in or around\nthe regex to be detected. To allow maximum flexibility for verification, a\nwebhook is used containing the regular expression matches.\n\nTruffleHog will send a JSON POST request containing the regex matches to a\nconfigured webhook endpoint. If the endpoint responds with a `200 OK` response\nstatus code, the secret is considered verified. If verification fails due to network/API errors, the result is marked as unknown.\n\nCustom Detectors support a few different filtering mechanisms: entropy, regex targeting the entire match, regex targeting the captured secret,\nand excluded word lists checked against the secret (captured group if present, entire match if capture group is not present). Note that if\nyour custom detector has multiple `regex` set (in this example `hogID`, and `hogToken`), then the filters get applied to each regex. [Here](examples/generic_with_filters.yml) is an example of a custom detector using these filters.\n\n**NB:** This feature is alpha and subject to change.\n\n### Regex Detector Example\n[Here](/pkg/custom_detectors/CUSTOM_DETECTORS.md) is how to setup a custom regex detector with verification server.\n\n## Generic JWT Detection\n\nTruffleHog supports detection and verification of a subset of generic JWTs it finds.\nSpecifically, if a JWT uses public-key cryptography rather than HMAC and the public key can be obtained, TruffleHog can determine whether the JWT is live or not.\n\n## :mag: Analyze\n\nTruffleHog supports running a deeper analysis of a credential to view its permissions and the resources it has access to.\n\n```bash\ntrufflehog analyze\n```\n\n# :heart: Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute. [[Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)].\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=trufflesecurity/trufflehog\" />\n</a>\n\n# :computer: Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome! Please see our [contribution guidelines first](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nWe no longer accept contributions to TruffleHog v2, but that code is available in the `v2` branch.\n\n## Adding new secret detectors\n\nWe have published some [documentation and tooling to get started on adding new secret detectors](hack/docs/Adding_Detectors_external.md). Let's improve detection together!\n\n# Use as a library\n\nCurrently, trufflehog is in heavy development and no guarantees can be made on\nthe stability of the public APIs at this time.\n\n# License Change\n\nSince v3.0, TruffleHog is released under a AGPL 3 license, included in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). TruffleHog v3.0 uses none of the previous codebase, but care was taken to preserve backwards compatibility on the command line interface. The work previous to this release is still available licensed under GPL 2.0 in the history of this repository and the previous package releases and tags. A completed CLA is required for us to accept contributions going forward.\n",

These GUIs are\ndeveloped independently from Stockfish and are available online. **Read the\ndocumentation for your GUI** of choice for information about how to use\nStockfish with it.\n\nSee also the Stockfish [documentation][wiki-usage-link] for further usage help.\n\n## Files\n\nThis distribution of Stockfish consists of the following files:\n\n  * [README.md][readme-link], the file you are currently reading.\n\n  * [Copying.txt][license-link], a text file containing the GNU General Public\n    License version 3.\n\n  * [AUTHORS][authors-link], a text file with the list of authors for the project.\n\n  * [src][src-link], a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a\n    Makefile that can be used to compile Stockfish on Unix-like systems.\n\n  * a file with the .nnue extension, storing the neural network for the NNUE\n    evaluation. Binary distributions will have this file embedded.\n\n## Contributing\n\n__See [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).__\n\n### Donating hardware\n\nImproving Stockfish requires a massive amount of testing. You can donate your\nhardware resources by installing the [Fishtest Worker][worker-link] and viewing\nthe current tests on [Fishtest][fishtest-link].\n\n### Improving the code\n\nIn the [chessprogramming wiki][programming-link], many techniques used in\nStockfish are explained with a lot of background information.\nThe [section on Stockfish][programmingsf-link] describes many features\nand techniques used by Stockfish. However, it is generic rather than\nfocused on Stockfish's precise implementation.\n\nThe engine testing is done on [Fishtest][fishtest-link].\nIf you want to help improve Stockfish, please read this [guideline][guideline-link]\nfirst, where the basics of Stockfish development are explained.\n\nDiscussions about Stockfish take place these days mainly in the Stockfish\n[Discord server][discord-link]. This is also the best place to ask questions\nabout the codebase and how to improve it.\n\n## Compiling Stockfish\n\nStockfish has support for 32 or 64-bit CPUs, certain hardware instructions,\nbig-endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.\n\nOn Unix-like systems, it should be easy to compile Stockfish directly from the\nsource code with the included Makefile in the folder `src`. In general, it is\nrecommended to run `make help` to see a list of make targets with corresponding\ndescriptions. An example suitable for most Intel and AMD chips:\n\n```\ncd src\nmake -j profile-build\n```\n\nDetailed compilation instructions for all platforms can be found in our\n[documentation][wiki-compile-link]. Our wiki also has information about\nthe [UCI commands][wiki-uci-link] supported by Stockfish.\n\n## Terms of use\n\nStockfish is free and distributed under the\n[**GNU General Public License version 3**][license-link] (GPL v3). Essentially,\nthis means you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program,\nincluding distributing it among your friends, making it available for download\nfrom your website, selling it (either by itself or as part of some bigger\nsoftware package), or using it as the starting point for a software project of\nyour own.\n\nThe only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Stockfish in some way,\nyou MUST always include the license and the full source code (or a pointer to\nwhere the source code can be found) to generate the exact binary you are\ndistributing. If you make any changes to the source code, these changes must\nalso be made available under GPL v3.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nStockfish uses neural networks trained on [data provided by the Leela Chess Zero\nproject][lc0-data-link], which is made available under the [Open Database License][odbl-link] (ODbL).\n\n\n[authors-link]:       https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/AUTHORS\n[build-link]:         https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/actions/workflows/stockfish.yml\n[commits-link]:       https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/commits/master\n[discord-link]:       https://discord.gg/GWDRS3kU6R\n[issue-link]:         https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=BUG-REPORT.yml\n[discussions-link]:   https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/discussions/new\n[fishtest-link]:      https://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests\n[guideline-link]:     https://github.com/official-stockfish/fishtest/wiki/Creating-my-first-test\n[license-link]:       https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/Copying.txt\n[programming-link]:   https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page\n[programmingsf-link]: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish\n[readme-link]:        https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/README.md\n[release-link]:       https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/releases/latest\n[src-link]:           https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/tree/master/src\n[stockfish128-logo]:  https://stockfishchess.org/images/logo/icon_128x128.png\n[uci-link]:           https://backscattering.de/chess/uci/\n[website-link]:       https://stockfishchess.org\n[website-blog-link]:  https://stockfishchess.org/blog/\n[wiki-link]:          https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki\n[wiki-compile-link]:  https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki/Compiling-from-source\n[wiki-uci-link]:      https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki/UCI-&-Commands\n[wiki-usage-link]:    https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki/Download-and-usage\n[worker-link]:        https://github.com/official-stockfish/fishtest/wiki/Running-the-worker\n[lc0-data-link]:      https://storage.lczero.org/files/training_data\n[odbl-link]:          https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/odbl-10.txt\n\n[build-badge]:        https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/official-stockfish/Stockfish/stockfish.yml?branch=master&style=for-the-badge&label=stockfish&logo=github\n[commits-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/official-stockfish/Stockfish/latest?style=for-the-badge\n[discord-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/discord/435943710472011776?style=for-the-badge&label=discord&logo=Discord\n[fishtest-badge]:     https://img.shields.io/website?style=for-the-badge&down_color=red&down_message=Offline&label=Fishtest&up_color=success&up_message=Online&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftests.stockfishchess.org%2Ftests%2Ffinished\n[license-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/github/license/official-stockfish/Stockfish?style=for-the-badge&label=license&color=success\n[release-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/official-stockfish/Stockfish?style=for-the-badge&label=official%20release\n[website-badge]:      https://img.shields.io/website?style=for-the-badge&down_color=red&down_message=Offline&label=website&up_color=success&up_message=Online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstockfishchess.org\n",

      "readme": "# Containerization\n\nThe Containerization package allows applications to use Linux containers.\nContainerization is written in [Swift](https://www.swift.org) and uses [Virtualization.framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization) on Apple silicon.\n\n> **Looking for command line binaries for running containers?**\\\n> They are available in the dedicated [apple/container](https://github.com/apple/container) repository.\n\nContainerization provides APIs to:\n\n- [Manage OCI images](./Sources/ContainerizationOCI/).\n- [Interact with remote registries](./Sources/ContainerizationOCI/Client/).\n- [Create and populate ext4 file systems](./Sources/ContainerizationEXT4/).\n- [Interact with the Netlink socket family](./Sources/ContainerizationNetlink/).\n- [Create an optimized Linux kernel for fast boot times](./kernel/).\n- [Spawn lightweight virtual machines and manage the runtime environment](./Sources/Containerization/LinuxContainer.swift).\n- [Spawn and interact with containerized processes](./Sources/Containerization/LinuxProcess.swift).\n- Use Rosetta 2 for running linux/amd64 containers on Apple silicon.\n\nPlease view the [API documentation](https://apple.github.io/containerization/documentation/) for information on the Swift packages that Containerization provides.\n\n## Design\n\nContainerization executes each Linux container inside of its own lightweight virtual machine. Clients can create dedicated IP addresses for every container to remove the need for individual port forwarding. Containers achieve sub-second start times using an optimized [Linux kernel configuration](/kernel) and a minimal root filesystem with a lightweight init system.\n\n[vminitd](/vminitd) is a small init system, which is a subproject within Containerization.\n`vminitd` is spawned as the initial process inside of the virtual machine and provides a GRPC API over vsock.\nThe API allows the runtime environment to be configured and containerized processes to be launched.\n`vminitd` provides I/O, signals, and events to the calling process when a process is run.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo build the Containerization package, you need:\n\n- Mac with Apple silicon\n- macOS 26\n- Xcode 26\n\nOlder versions of macOS are not supported. \n\n## Example Usage\n\nFor examples of how to use some of the libraries surface, the cctl executable is a good start. This app is a useful playground for exploring the API. It contains commands that exercise some of the core functionality of the various products, such as:\n\n1. [Manipulating OCI images](./Sources/cctl/ImageCommand.swift)\n2. [Logging in to container registries](./Sources/cctl/LoginCommand.swift)\n3. [Creating root filesystem blocks](./Sources/cctl/RootfsCommand.swift)\n4. [Running simple Linux containers](./Sources/cctl/RunCommand.swift)\n\n## Linux kernel\n\nA Linux kernel is required for spawning lightweight virtual machines on macOS.\nContainerization provides an optimized kernel configuration located in the [kernel](./kernel) directory.\n\nThis directory includes a containerized build environment to easily compile a kernel for use with Containerization.\n\nThe kernel configuration is a minimal set of features to support fast start times and a light weight environment.\n\nWhile this configuration will work for the majority of workloads we understand that some will need extra features.\nTo solve this Containerization provides first class APIs to use different kernel configurations and versions on a per container basis.\nThis enables containers to be developed and validated across different kernel versions.\n\nSee the [README](/kernel/README.md) in the kernel directory for instructions on how to compile the optimized kernel.\n\n### Kernel Support\n\nContainerization allows user provided kernels but tests functionality starting with kernel version `6.14.9`.\n\n### Pre-built Kernel\n\nIf you wish to consume a pre-built kernel, make sure it has `VIRTIO` drivers compiled into the kernel (not merely as modules).\n\nThe [Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) project provides a Linux kernel that is optimized for containers, with all required configuration options enabled. The [releases](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/releases/) page contains downloadable artifacts, and the image itself (`vmlinux.container`) can be found in the `/opt/kata/share/kata-containers/` directory. \n\n## Prepare to build package\n\nInstall the recommended version of Xcode.\n\nSet the active developer directory to the installed Xcode (replace `<PATH_TO_XCODE>`):\n```bash\nsudo xcode-select -s <PATH_TO_XCODE>\n``` \n\nInstall [Swiftly](https://github.com/swiftlang/swiftly), [Swift](https://www.swift.org), and [Static Linux SDK](https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/static-linux-getting-started.html):\n\n```bash\nmake cross-prep\n```\n\nIf you use a custom terminal application, you may need to move this command from `.zprofile` to `.zshrc` (replace `<USERNAME>`):\n\n```bash\n# Added by swiftly\n. \"/Users/<USERNAME>/.swiftly/env.sh\"\n```\n\nRestart the terminal application. Ensure this command returns `/Users/<USERNAME>/.swiftly/bin/swift` (replace `<USERNAME>`):\n\n```bash\nwhich swift\n```\n\nIf you've installed or used a Static Linux SDK previously, you may need to remove older SDK versions from the system (replace `<SDK-ID>`):\n\n```bash\nswift sdk list\nswift sdk remove <SDK-ID>\n```\n\n## Build the package\n\nBuild Containerization from sources:\n\n```bash\nmake all\n```\n\n## Test the package\n\nAfter building, run basic and integration tests:\n\n```bash\nmake test integration\n```\n\nA kernel is required to run integration tests.\nIf you do not have a kernel locally for use a default kernel can be fetched using the `make fetch-default-kernel` target.\n\nFetching the default kernel only needs to happen after an initial build or after a `make clean`.\n\n```bash\nmake fetch-default-kernel\nmake all test integration\n```\n\n## Protobufs\n\nContainerization depends on specific versions of `grpc-swift` and `swift-protobuf`. You can install them and re-generate RPC interfaces with:\n\n```bash\nmake protos\n```\n\n## Building a kernel\n\nIf you'd like to build your own kernel please see the instructions in the [kernel directory](./kernel/README.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\nGenerate the API documentation for local viewing with:\n\n```bash\nmake docs\nmake serve-docs\n```\n\nPreview the documentation by running in another terminal:\n\n```bash\nopen http://localhost:8000/containerization/documentation/\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to Containerization are welcomed and encouraged. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n\n## Project Status\n\nVersion 0.1.0 is the first official release of Containerization. Earlier versions have no source stability guarantees.\n\nBecause the Containerization library is under active development, source stability is only guaranteed within minor versions (for example, between 0.1.1 and 0.1.2). If you don't want potentially source-breaking package updates, you can specify your package dependency using .upToNextMinorVersion(from: \"0.1.0\") instead.\n\nFuture minor versions of the package may introduce changes to these rules as needed.\n",

It can be used in \nSwiftUI, UIKit, and more, and on any Apple platform (iOS, macOS, iPadOS, visionOS, tvOS, and watchOS).\n\n* [What is the Composable Architecture?](#what-is-the-composable-architecture)\n* [Learn more](#learn-more)\n* [Examples](#examples)\n* [Basic usage](#basic-usage)\n* [Documentation](#documentation)\n* [FAQ](#faq)\n* [Community](#community)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Translations](#translations)\n\n## What is the Composable Architecture?\n\nThis library provides a few core tools that can be used to build applications of varying purpose and \ncomplexity. It provides compelling stories that you can follow to solve many problems you encounter \nday-to-day when building applications, such as:\n\n* **State management**\n  <br> How to manage the state of your application using simple value types, and share state across \n  many screens so that mutations in one screen can be immediately observed in another screen.\n\n* **Composition**\n  <br> How to break down large features into smaller components that can be extracted to their own, \n  isolated modules and be easily glued back together to form the feature.\n\n* **Side effects**\n  <br> How to let certain parts of the application talk to the outside world in the most testable \n  and understandable way possible.\n\n* **Testing**\n  <br> How to not only test a feature built in the architecture, but also write integration tests \n  for features that have been composed of many parts, and write end-to-end tests to understand how \n  side effects influence your application. This allows you to make strong guarantees that your \n  business logic is running in the way you expect.\n\n* **Ergonomics**\n  <br> How to accomplish all of the above in a simple API with as few concepts and moving parts as \n  possible.\n\n## Learn More\n\nThe Composable Architecture was designed over the course of many episodes on \n[Point-Free][pointfreeco], a video series exploring advanced programming topics in the Swift language, \nhosted by [Brandon Williams][mbrandonw] and [Stephen Celis][stephencelis].\n\nYou can watch all of the episodes [here][tca-episode-collection], as well as a dedicated, [multipart\ntour][tca-tour] of the architecture from scratch.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.pointfree.co/collections/tours/composable-architecture-1-0\">\n  <img alt=\"video poster image\" src=\"https://d3rccdn33rt8ze.cloudfront.net/episodes/0243.jpeg\" width=\"600\">\n</a>\n\n## Examples\n\n[![Screen shots of example applications](https://d3rccdn33rt8ze.cloudfront.net/composable-architecture/demos.png)](./Examples)\n\nThis repo comes with _lots_ of examples to demonstrate how to solve common and complex problems with \nthe Composable Architecture.

The reducer is also responsible for returning any effects that should be \nrun, such as API requests, which can be done by returning an `Effect` value.\n* **Store**: The runtime that actually drives your feature. You send all user actions to the store \nso that the store can run the reducer and effects, and you can observe state changes in the store \nso that you can update UI.\n\nThe benefits of doing this are that you will instantly unlock testability of your feature, and you \nwill be able to break large, complex features into smaller domains that can be glued together.\n\nAs a basic example, consider a UI that shows a number along with \"+\" and \"−\" buttons that increment \nand decrement the number. To make things interesting, suppose there is also a button that when \ntapped makes an API request to fetch a random fact about that number and displays it in the view.\n\nTo implement this feature we create a new type that will house the domain and behavior of the \nfeature, and it will be annotated with the `@Reducer` macro:\n\n```swift\nimport ComposableArchitecture\n\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n}\n```\n\nIn here we need to define a type for the feature's state, which consists of an integer for the \ncurrent count, as well as an optional string that represents the fact being presented:\n\n```swift\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n  @ObservableState\n  struct State: Equatable {\n    var count = 0\n    var numberFact: String?\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> [!Note] \n> We've applied the `@ObservableState` macro to `State` in order to take advantage of the\n> observation tools in the library.\n\nWe also need to define a type for the feature's actions. There are the obvious actions, such as \ntapping the decrement button, increment button, or fact button. But there are also some slightly \nnon-obvious ones, such as the action that occurs when we receive a response from the fact API \nrequest:\n\n```swift\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n  @ObservableState\n  struct State: Equatable { /* ... */ }\n  enum Action {\n    case decrementButtonTapped\n    case incrementButtonTapped\n    case numberFactButtonTapped\n    case numberFactResponse(String)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then we implement the `body` property, which is responsible for composing the actual logic and \nbehavior for the feature. In it we can use the `Reduce` reducer to describe how to change the\ncurrent state to the next state, and what effects need to be executed. Some actions don't need to\nexecute effects, and they can return `.none` to represent that:\n\n```swift\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n  @ObservableState\n  struct State: Equatable { /* ... */ }\n  enum Action { /* ... */ }\n\n  var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {\n    Reduce { state, action in\n      switch action {\n      case .decrementButtonTapped:\n        state.count -= 1\n        return .none\n\n      case .incrementButtonTapped:\n        state.count += 1\n        return .none\n\n      case .numberFactButtonTapped:\n        return .run { [count = state.count] send in\n          let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(\n            from: URL(string: \"http://numbersapi.com/\\(count)/trivia\")!\n          )\n          await send(\n            .numberFactResponse(String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self))\n          )\n        }\n\n      case let .numberFactResponse(fact):\n        state.numberFact = fact\n        return .none\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then finally we define the view that displays the feature. It holds onto a `StoreOf<Feature>` \nso that it can observe all changes to the state and re-render, and we can send all user actions to \nthe store so that state changes:\n\n```swift\nstruct FeatureView: View {\n  let store: StoreOf<Feature>\n\n  var body: some View {\n    Form {\n      Section {\n        Text(\"\\(store.count)\")\n        Button(\"Decrement\") { store.send(.decrementButtonTapped) }\n        Button(\"Increment\") { store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) }\n      }\n\n      Section {\n        Button(\"Number fact\") { store.send(.numberFactButtonTapped) }\n      }\n      \n      if let fact = store.numberFact {\n        Text(fact)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt is also straightforward to have a UIKit controller driven off of this store. You can observe\nstate changes in the store in `viewDidLoad`, and then populate the UI components with data from\nthe store. The code is a bit longer than the SwiftUI version, so we have collapsed it here:\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>\n\n  ```swift\n  class FeatureViewController: UIViewController {\n    let store: StoreOf<Feature>\n\n    init(store: StoreOf<Feature>) {\n      self.store = store\n      super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n    }\n\n    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {\n      fatalError(\"init(coder:) has not been implemented\")\n    }\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n      super.viewDidLoad()\n\n      let countLabel = UILabel()\n      let decrementButton = UIButton()\n      let incrementButton = UIButton()\n      let factLabel = UILabel()\n      \n      // Omitted: Add subviews and set up constraints...\n      \n      observe { [weak self] in\n        guard let self \n        else { return }\n        \n        countLabel.text = \"\\(self.store.count)\"\n        factLabel.text = self.store.numberFact\n      }\n    }\n\n    @objc private func incrementButtonTapped() {\n      self.store.send(.incrementButtonTapped)\n    }\n    @objc private func decrementButtonTapped() {\n      self.store.send(.decrementButtonTapped)\n    }\n    @objc private func factButtonTapped() {\n      self.store.send(.numberFactButtonTapped)\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n</details>\n\nOnce we are ready to display this view, for example in the app's entry point, we can construct a \nstore. This can be done by specifying the initial state to start the application in, as well as \nthe reducer that will power the application:\n\n```swift\nimport ComposableArchitecture\n\n@main\nstruct MyApp: App {\n  var body: some Scene {\n    WindowGroup {\n      FeatureView(\n        store: Store(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n          Feature()\n        }\n      )\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd that is enough to get something on the screen to play around with. It's definitely a few more \nsteps than if you were to do this in a vanilla SwiftUI way, but there are a few benefits. It gives \nus a consistent manner to apply state mutations, instead of scattering logic in some observable \nobjects and in various action closures of UI components. It also gives us a concise way of \nexpressing side effects. And we can immediately test this logic, including the effects, without \ndoing much additional work.\n\n### Testing\n\n> [!Note] \n> For more in-depth information on testing, see the dedicated [testing][testing-article] article. \n\nTo test use a `TestStore`, which can be created with the same information as the `Store`, but it \ndoes extra work to allow you to assert how your feature evolves as actions are sent:\n\n```swift\n@Test\nfunc basics() async {\n  let store = TestStore(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n    Feature()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce the test store is created we can use it to make an assertion of an entire user flow of steps. \nEach step of the way we need to prove that state changed how we expect. For example, we can \nsimulate the user flow of tapping on the increment and decrement buttons:\n\n```swift\n// Test that tapping on the increment/decrement buttons changes the count\nawait store.send(.incrementButtonTapped) {\n  $0.count = 1\n}\nawait store.send(.decrementButtonTapped) {\n  $0.count = 0\n}\n```\n\nFurther, if a step causes an effect to be executed, which feeds data back into the store, we must \nassert on that. For example, if we simulate the user tapping on the fact button we expect to \nreceive a fact response back with the fact, which then causes the `numberFact` state to be \npopulated:\n\n```swift\nawait store.send(.numberFactButtonTapped)\n\nawait store.receive(\\.numberFactResponse) {\n  $0.numberFact = ???\n}\n```\n\nHowever, how do we know what fact is going to be sent back to us?\n\nCurrently our reducer is using an effect that reaches out into the real world to hit an API server, \nand that means we have no way to control its behavior. We are at the whims of our internet \nconnectivity and the availability of the API server in order to write this test.\n\nIt would be better for this dependency to be passed to the reducer so that we can use a live \ndependency when running the application on a device, but use a mocked dependency for tests. We can \ndo this by adding a property to the `Feature` reducer:\n\n```swift\n@Reducer\nstruct Feature {\n  let numberFact: (Int) async throws -> String\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThen we can use it in the `reduce` implementation:\n\n```swift\ncase .numberFactButtonTapped:\n  return .run { [count = state.count] send in \n    let fact = try await self.numberFact(count)\n    await send(.numberFactResponse(fact))\n  }\n```\n\nAnd in the entry point of the application we can provide a version of the dependency that actually \ninteracts with the real world API server:\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct MyApp: App {\n  var body: some Scene {\n    WindowGroup {\n      FeatureView(\n        store: Store(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n          Feature(\n            numberFact: { number in\n              let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(\n                from: URL(string: \"http://numbersapi.com/\\(number)\")!\n              )\n              return String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)\n            }\n          )\n        }\n      )\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut in tests we can use a mock dependency that immediately returns a deterministic, predictable \nfact: \n\n```swift\n@Test\nfunc basics() async {\n  let store = TestStore(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n    Feature(numberFact: { \"\\($0) is a good number Brent\" })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith that little bit of upfront work we can finish the test by simulating the user tapping on the \nfact button, and then receiving the response from the dependency to present the fact:\n\n```swift\nawait store.send(.numberFactButtonTapped)\n\nawait store.receive(\\.numberFactResponse) {\n  $0.numberFact = \"0 is a good number Brent\"\n}\n```\n\nWe can also improve the ergonomics of using the `numberFact` dependency in our application. Over \ntime the application may evolve into many features, and some of those features may also want access \nto `numberFact`, and explicitly passing it through all layers can get annoying. There is a process \nyou can follow to “register” dependencies with the library, making them instantly available to any \nlayer in the application.\n\n> [!Note] \n> For more in-depth information on dependency management, see the dedicated\n> [dependencies][dependencies-article] article. \n\nWe can start by wrapping the number fact functionality in a new type:\n\n```swift\nstruct NumberFactClient {\n  var fetch: (Int) async throws -> String\n}\n```\n\nAnd then registering that type with the dependency management system by conforming the client to\nthe `DependencyKey` protocol, which requires you to specify the live value to use when running the\napplication in simulators or devices:\n\n```swift\nextension NumberFactClient: DependencyKey {\n  static let liveValue = Self(\n    fetch: { number in\n      let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared\n        .data(from: URL(string: \"http://numbersapi.com/\\(number)\")!\n      )\n      return String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nextension DependencyValues {\n  var numberFact: NumberFactClient {\n    get { self[NumberFactClient.self] }\n    set { self[NumberFactClient.self] = newValue }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith that little bit of upfront work done you can instantly start making use of the dependency in \nany feature by using the `@Dependency` property wrapper:\n\n```diff\n @Reducer\n struct Feature {\n-  let numberFact: (Int) async throws -> String\n+  @Dependency(\\.numberFact) var numberFact\n   \n   …\n\n-  try await self.numberFact(count)\n+  try await self.numberFact.fetch(count)\n }\n```\n\nThis code works exactly as it did before, but you no longer have to explicitly pass the dependency \nwhen constructing the feature's reducer. When running the app in previews, the simulator or on a \ndevice, the live dependency will be provided to the reducer, and in tests the test dependency will \nbe provided.\n\nThis means the entry point to the application no longer needs to construct dependencies:\n\n```swift\n@main\nstruct MyApp: App {\n  var body: some Scene {\n    WindowGroup {\n      FeatureView(\n        store: Store(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n          Feature()\n        }\n      )\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd the test store can be constructed without specifying any dependencies, but you can still \noverride any dependency you need to for the purpose of the test:\n\n```swift\nlet store = TestStore(initialState: Feature.State()) {\n  Feature()\n} withDependencies: {\n  $0.numberFact.fetch = { \"\\($0) is a good number Brent\" }\n}\n\n// ...\n```\n\nThat is the basics of building and testing a feature in the Composable Architecture. There are \n_a lot_ more things to be explored, such as composition, modularity, adaptability, and complex \neffects. The [Examples](./Examples) directory has a bunch of projects to explore to see more \nadvanced usages.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation for releases and `main` are available here:\n\n* [`main`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture)\n* [1.x.x](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/~/documentation/composablearchitecture)\n\nThere are a number of articles in the documentation that you may find helpful as you become more \ncomfortable with the library:\n\n* [Getting started][getting-started-article]\n* [Dependencies][dependencies-article]\n* [Testing][testing-article]\n* [Navigation][navigation-article]\n* [Sharing state][sharing-state-article]\n* [Performance][performance-article]\n* [Concurrency][concurrency-article]\n* [Bindings][bindings-article]\n\n## FAQ\n\nWe have a [dedicated article][faq-article] for all of the most frequently asked questions and\ncomments people have concerning the library.\n\n## Community\n\nIf you want to discuss the Composable Architecture or have a question about how to use it to solve \na particular problem, there are a number of places you can discuss with fellow \n[Point-Free](http://www.pointfree.co) enthusiasts:\n\n* For long-form discussions, we recommend the [discussions][gh-discussions] tab of this repo.\n* For casual chat, we recommend the [Point-Free Community slack](http://pointfree.co/slack-invite).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can add ComposableArchitecture to an Xcode project by adding it as a package dependency.\n\n  1. From the **File** menu, select **Add Package Dependencies...**\n  2. Enter \"https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture\" into the package \n     repository URL text field\n  3. Depending on how your project is structured:\n      - If you have a single application target that needs access to the library, then add \n        **ComposableArchitecture** directly to your application.\n      - If you want to use this library from multiple Xcode targets, or mix Xcode targets and SPM \n        targets, you must create a shared framework that depends on **ComposableArchitecture** and \n        then depend on that framework in all of your targets. For an example of this, check out the \n        [Tic-Tac-Toe](./Examples/TicTacToe) demo application, which splits lots of features into \n        modules and consumes the static library in this fashion using the **tic-tac-toe** Swift \n        package.\n\n## Companion libraries\n\nThe Composable Architecture is built with extensibility in mind, and there are a number of\ncommunity-supported libraries available to enhance your applications:\n\n* [Composable Architecture Extras](https://github.com/Ryu0118/swift-composable-architecture-extras):\n  A companion library to the Composable Architecture.\n* [TCAComposer](https://github.com/mentalflux/tca-composer): A macro framework for generating\n  boiler-plate code in the Composable Architecture.\n* [TCACoordinators](https://github.com/johnpatrickmorgan/TCACoordinators): The coordinator pattern\n  in the Composable Architecture.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute a library, please [open a\nPR](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/edit/main/README.md) with a link\nto it!\n\n## Translations\n\nThe following translations of this README have been contributed by members of the community:\n\n* [Arabic](https://gist.github.com/NorhanBoghdadi/1b98d55c02b683ddef7e05c2ebcccd47)\n* [French](https://gist.github.com/nikitamounier/0e93eb832cf389db12f9a69da030a2dc)\n* [Hindi](https://gist.github.com/akashsoni01/b358ee0b3b747167964ef6946123c88d)\n* [Indonesian](https://gist.github.com/wendyliga/792ea9ac5cc887f59de70a9e39cc7343)\n* [Italian](https://gist.github.com/Bellaposa/5114e6d4d55fdb1388e8186886d48958)\n* [Japanese](https://gist.github.com/Achoo-kr/2d0712deb77f78b3379551ac7baea3e4)\n* [Korean](https://gist.github.com/Achoo-kr/5d8936d12e71028fcc4a7c5e078ca038)\n* [Polish](https://gist.github.com/MarcelStarczyk/6b6153051f46912a665c32199f0d1d54)\n* [Portuguese](https://gist.github.com/SevioCorrea/2bbf337cd084a58c89f2f7f370626dc8)\n* [Russian](https://gist.github.com/SubvertDev/3317d0c3b35ed601be330d6fc0df5aba)\n* [Simplified Chinese](https://gist.github.com/sh3l6orrr/10c8f7c634a892a9c37214f3211242ad)\n* [Spanish](https://gist.github.com/pitt500/f5e32fccb575ce112ffea2827c7bf942)\n* [Turkish](https://gist.github.com/gokhanamal/93001244ef0c1cec58abeb1afc0de37c)\n* [Ukrainian](https://gist.github.com/barabashd/33b64676195ce41f4bb73c327ea512a8)\n\nIf you'd like to contribute a translation, please [open a\nPR](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/edit/main/README.md) with a link \nto a [Gist](https://gist.github.com)!\n\n## Credits and thanks\n\nThe following people gave feedback on the library at its early stages and helped make the library \nwhat it is today:\n\nPaul Colton, Kaan Dedeoglu, Matt Diephouse, Josef Doležal, Eimantas, Matthew Johnson, George \nKaimakas, Nikita Leonov, Christopher Liscio, Jeffrey Macko, Alejandro Martinez, Shai Mishali, Willis \nPlummer, Simon-Pierre Roy, Justin Price, Sven A.

      "readme": "# `container`\n\n`container` is a tool that you can use to create and run Linux containers as lightweight virtual machines on your Mac. It's written in Swift, and optimized for Apple silicon.\n\nThe tool consumes and produces [OCI-compatible container images](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec), so you can pull and run images from any standard container registry. You can push images that you build to those registries as well, and run the images in any other OCI-compatible application.\n\n`container` uses the [Containerization](https://github.com/apple/containerization) Swift package for low level container, image, and process management.\n\n![introductory movie showing some basic commands](./docs/assets/landing-movie.gif)\n\n## Get started\n\n### Requirements\n\nYou need a Mac with Apple silicon to run `container`. To build it, see the [BUILDING](./BUILDING.md) document.\n\n`container` is supported on macOS 26, since it takes advantage of new features and enhancements to virtualization and networking in this release. We do not support older versions of macOS and the `container` maintainers typically will not address issues that cannot be reproduced on the macOS 26.\n\n### Install or upgrade\n\nIf you're upgrading, first stop and uninstall your existing `container` (the `-k` flag keeps your user data, while `-d` removes it):\n\n```bash\ncontainer system stop\n/usr/local/bin/uninstall-container.sh -k\n```\n\nDownload the latest signed installer package for `container` from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/apple/container/releases).\n\nTo install the tool, double-click the package file and follow the instructions. Enter your administrator password when prompted, to give the installer permission to place the installed files under `/usr/local`.\n\nStart the system service with:\n\n```bash\ncontainer system start\n```\n\n### Uninstall\n\nUse the `uninstall-container.sh` script (installed to `/usr/local/bin`) to remove `container` from your system. To remove your user data along with the tool, run:\n\n```bash\n/usr/local/bin/uninstall-container.sh -d\n```\n\nTo retain your user data so that it is available should you reinstall later, run:\n\n```bash\n/usr/local/bin/uninstall-container.sh -k\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\n- Take [a guided tour of `container`](./docs/tutorial.md) by building, running, and publishing a simple web server image.\n- Learn how to [use various `container` features](./docs/how-to.md).\n- Read a brief description and [technical overview](./docs/technical-overview.md) of `container`.\n- Browse the [full command reference](./docs/command-reference.md).\n- [Build and run](./BUILDING.md) `container` on your own development system.\n- View the project [API documentation](https://apple.github.io/container/documentation/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to `container` are welcomed and encouraged. Please see our [main contributing guide](https://github.com/apple/containerization/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n\n## Project Status\n\nThe container project is currently under active development. Its stability, both for consuming the project as a Swift package and the `container` tool, is only guaranteed within patch versions, such as between 0.1.1 and 0.1.2. Minor version number releases may include breaking changes until we achieve a 1.0.0 release.\n",

Meshery enables consistent configuration, operation, and observability across your entire Kubernetes landscape.\n\n<details><summary><h4>Dry-run your deployments</h4></summary>\nMeshery leverages Kubernetes' built-in dry-run capabilities to allow you to simulate deployments without actually applying the changes to your cluster. This enables you to:\n\n- Validate configurations: Ensure your deployment specifications (e.g., YAML manifests, Helm charts, Meshery Designs) are syntactically correct and will be accepted by the Kubernetes API server.   \n- Identify potential issues: Detect errors in your configurations, such as invalid resource definitions, missing fields, or API version mismatches, before they impact your live environment.\n- Preview changes: Understand the objects that Kubernetes would create or modify during a real deployment.\n- Integrate with CI/CD: Incorporate dry-run as a step in your continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines to automate pre-deployment checks and prevent faulty deployments.\n\nBy providing this dry-run functionality, Meshery helps you increase the reliability and stability of your Kubernetes deployments by catching potential problems early in the development and deployment process.\n<!-- \nAssess your cloud native infrastructure configuration against deployment and operational best practices with Meshery's configuration validator. Manage your workloads with confidence. Check your Kubernetes configuration for anti-patterns and avoid common pitfalls. -->\n\n</details>\n\n### Visually and collaboratively manage your infrastructure\n\nUsing a GitOps-centric approach, visually and collaboratively design and manage your infrastructure and microservices.

      "readme": "# swirl courses\n\nThis is a collection of interactive courses for use with the [swirl R package](http://swirlstats.com). You'll find instructions for installing courses further down on this page. Some courses are still in development and we'd love to hear any [suggestions](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/issues/new) you have as you work through them.\n\nFor more information regarding swirl, visit [swirlstats.com](http://swirlstats.com) or the [swirl GitHub repository](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl). If you'd like to write your own interactive content, please visit the [Instructors page](http://swirlstats.com/instructors.html) of our website.\n\nHere are our current offerings, organized by level of difficulty:\n\n#### Beginner\n\n- **R Programming**: The basics of programming in R\n- [**R Programming E**](https://github.com/swirldev/R_Programming_E): Same as the original, but modified slightly for in-class use (see below ***)\n- [**The R Programming Environment**](https://swirlstats.com/scn/rpe.html)\n<!-- - **Data Analysis**: Basic ideas in statistics and data visualization -->\n<!-- - **Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp**: One- and two-sample t-tests, power, and sample size -->\n<!-- - **Open Intro**: A very basic introduction to statistics, data analysis, and data visualization -->\n\n\\*\\*\\* *R Programming E is identical to R Programming, except we've eliminated the prompts for Coursera credentials at the end of each lesson and instead give students the option to send an email to their instructor notifying them of completion. Admittedly, it's sort of a hack until we come up with a more robust solution for in-class use (i.e. an instructor \"dashboard\").*\n\n#### Intermediate\n\n- **Regression Models**: The basics of regression modeling in R\n- **Getting and Cleaning Data**: dplyr, tidyr, lubridate, oh my!\n\n#### Advanced\n\n- **Statistical Inference**: This intermediate to advanced level course closely follows the\n[Statistical Inference course](https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference) of the Johns Hopkins \n[Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) on Coursera. It\nintroduces the student to basic concepts of statistical inference\nincluding probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and\np-values. It concludes with an initiation to topics of particular\nrelevance to big data, issues of multiple testing and resampling.\n- [**Advanced R Programming**](https://swirlstats.com/scn/arp.html)\n\nSince our users come from a variety backgrounds, it's very hard to label material as **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced**. If you find something that is labelled **Beginner** to be challenging, please don't be discouraged. The first step of learning anything is to acknowledge that you are capable of understanding it. True understanding will come with time and practice.\n\n#### Course Authors\n\n- **Writing swirl Courses**: An interactive guides and example \n  for swirl course authors. The first group of lessons cover basics. The rest cover \n  special topics useful primarily as samples--points of departure for one's own material.\n  For more comprehensive documentation about writing your own swirl courses see http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/.\n\n## Install and run a course automatically from swirl\n\n**This is the preferred method of installing courses.** It automates the process by allowing you to do everything right from the R console.\n\n1) Make sure you have a recent version version of swirl:\n\n```\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\")\n```\n\n2) Enter the following from the R console, **substituting the name of the course** that you wish to install:\n\n```\nlibrary(swirl)\ninstall_course(\"Course Name Here\")\nswirl()\n```\n\nFor example, `install_course(\"R Programming\")` will install the R Programming course. **Please note that course names are case sensitive!**\n\nIf that doesn't work for you...\n\n## Install and run a course manually\n\nIf the automatic course installation method outlined above does not work for you, then there's a simple alternative.\n\n1. Find the course you want to install on the [Swirl Course network website](https://swirlstats.com/scn/title.html).\n2. Follow the manual installation instructions on the course page.\n\nIf that does not work for you, consider taking a look at the \n[legacy manual install instructions](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/wiki/Legacy-Manual-Install-Instructions-for-Swirl-Courses).\n\n## Uninstall a course\n\nIf you'd like to remove a course at any time, you can use `uninstall_course(\"Course Name Here\")`.\n\n## Using swirl in the classroom\n\nInstructors around the world are using swirl in their classrooms. We think this is awesome. If you're an instructor, please feel free to do the same -- free of charge. While your students may be paying to take your course or attend your institution, we simply ask that you don't charge people *directly* for the use of our software or instructional content.\n\nIf you are not sure about a particular use case, don't hesitate to post a\nquestion to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swirl-discuss).\n",

--strip-components 2\n```\n\n*[click here to view the files that will be created](https://github.com/glanceapp/docker-compose-template/tree/main/root)*\n\nThen, edit the following files as desired:\n* `docker-compose.yml` to configure the port, volumes and other containery things\n* `config/home.yml` to configure the widgets or layout of the home page\n* `config/glance.yml` if you want to change the theme or add more pages\n\n<details>\n<summary>Other files you may want to edit</summary>\n\n* `.env` to configure environment variables that will be available inside configuration files\n* `assets/user.css` to add custom CSS\n</details>\n\nWhen ready, run:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nIf you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose logs\n```\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Docker compose manual</strong></summary>\n<br>\n\nCreate a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  glance:\n    container_name: glance\n    image: glanceapp/glance\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    volumes:\n      - ./config:/app/config\n    ports:\n      - 8080:8080\n```\n\nThen, create a new directory called `config` and download the example starting [`glance.yml`](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/blob/main/docs/glance.yml) file into it by running:\n\n```bash\nmkdir config && wget -O config/glance.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml\n```\n\nFeel free to edit the `glance.yml` file to your liking, and when ready run:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nIf you encounter any issues, you can check the logs by running:\n\n```bash\ndocker logs glance\n```\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Manual binary installation</strong></summary>\n<br>\n\nPrecompiled binaries are available for Linux, Windows and macOS (x86, x86_64, ARM and ARM64 architectures).\n\n### Linux\n\nVisit the [latest release page](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) for available binaries. You can place the binary in `/opt/glance/` and have it start with your server via a [systemd service](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-systemd-services/). By default, when running the binary, it will look for a `glance.yml` file in the directory it's placed in. To specify a different path for the config file, use the `--config` option:\n\n```bash\n/opt/glance/glance --config /etc/glance.yml\n```\n\nTo grab a starting template for the config file, run:\n\n```bash\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nDownload and extract the executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/releases/latest) (most likely the file called `glance-windows-amd64.zip` if you're on a 64-bit system) and place it in a folder of your choice. Then, create a new text file called `glance.yml` in the same folder and paste the content from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glanceapp/glance/refs/heads/main/docs/glance.yml) in it. You should then be able to run the executable and access the dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.\n\n\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Other</strong></summary>\n<br>\n\nGlance can also be installed through the following 3rd party channels:\n* [Proxmox VE Helper Script](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=glance)\n* [NixOS package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=glance)\n* [Coolify.io](https://coolify.io/docs/services/glance/)\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<br>\n\n## Common issues\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Requests timing out</strong></summary>\n\nThe most common cause of this is when using Pi-Hole, AdGuard Home or other ad-blocking DNS services, which by default have a fairly low rate limit. Depending on the number of widgets you have in a single page, this limit can very easily be exceeded. To fix this, increase the rate limit in the settings of your DNS service.\n\nIf using Podman, in some rare cases the timeout can be caused by an unknown issue, in which case it may be resolved by adding the following to the bottom of your `docker-compose.yml` file:\n```yaml\nnetworks:\n  podman:\n    external: true\n```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Broken layout for markets, bookmarks or other widgets</strong></summary>\n\nThis is almost always caused by the browser extension Dark Reader. To fix this, disable dark mode for the domain where Glance is hosted.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>cannot unmarshal !!map into []glance.page</strong></summary>\n\nThe most common cause of this is having a `pages` key in your `glance.yml` and then also having a `pages` key inside one of your included pages. To fix this, remove the `pages` key from the top of your included pages.\n\n</details>\n\n<br>\n\n## FAQ\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Does the information on the page update automatically?</strong></summary>\nNo, a page refresh is required to update the information. Some things do dynamically update where it makes sense, like the clock widget and the relative time showing how long ago something happened.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>How frequently do widgets update?</strong></summary>\nNo requests are made periodically in the background, information is only fetched upon loading the page and then cached. The default cache lifetime is different for each widget and can be configured.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Can I create my own widgets?</strong></summary>\n\nYes, there are multiple ways to create custom widgets:\n* `iframe` widget - allows you to embed things from other websites\n* `html` widget - allows you to insert your own static HTML\n* `extension` widget - fetch HTML from a URL\n* `custom-api` widget - fetch JSON from a URL and render it using custom HTML\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Can I change the title of a widget?</strong></summary>\n\nYes, the title of all widgets can be changed by specifying the `title` property in the widget's configuration:\n\n```yaml\n- type: rss\n  title: My custom title\n\n- type: markets\n  title: My custom title\n\n- type: videos\n  title: My custom title\n\n# and so on for all widgets...\n```\n</details>\n\n<br>\n\n## Feature requests\n\nNew feature suggestions are always welcome and will be considered, though please keep in mind that some of them may be out of scope for what the project is trying to achieve (or is reasonably capable of). If you have an idea for a new feature and would like to share it, you can do so [here](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).\n\nFeature requests are tagged with one of the following:\n\n* [Roadmap](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/roadmap) - will be implemented in a future release\n* [Backlog](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/backlog) - may be implemented in the future but needs further feedback or interest from the community\n* [Icebox](https://github.com/glanceapp/glance/labels/icebox) - no plans to implement as it doesn't currently align with the project's goals or capabilities, may be revised at a later date\n\n<br>\n\n## Building from source\n\nChoose one of the following methods:\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Build binary with Go</strong></summary>\n<br>\n\nRequirements: [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) >= v1.23\n\nTo build the project for your current OS and architecture, run:\n\n```bash\ngo build -o build/glance .\n```\n\nTo build for a specific OS and architecture, run:\n\n```bash\nGOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/glance .\n```\n\n[*click here for a full list of GOOS and GOARCH combinations*](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#:~:text=$GOOS%20and%20$GOARCH)\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to run the app without creating a binary, like when you're testing out changes, you can run:\n\n```bash\ngo run .\n```\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Build project and Docker image with Docker</strong></summary>\n<br>\n\nRequirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)\n\nTo build the project and image using just Docker, run:\n\n*(replace `owner` with your name or organization)*\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t owner/glance:latest .\n```\n\nIf you wish to push the image to a registry (by default Docker Hub), run:\n\n```bash\ndocker push owner/glance:latest\n```\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n<br>\n\n## Contributing guidelines\n\n* Before working on a new feature it's preferable to submit a feature request first and state that you'd like to implement it yourself\n* Please don't submit PRs for feature requests that are either in the roadmap<sup>[1]</sup>, backlog<sup>[2]</sup> or icebox<sup>[3]</sup>\n* Use `dev` for the base branch if you're adding new features or fixing bugs, otherwise use `main`\n* Avoid introducing new dependencies\n* Avoid making backwards-incompatible configuration changes\n* Avoid introducing new colors or hard-coding colors, use the standard `primary`, `positive` and `negative`\n* For icons, try to use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) where applicable\n* Provide a screenshot of the changes if UI related where possible\n* No `package.json`\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong><sup>[1] [2] [3]</sup></strong></summary>\n\n[1] The feature likely already has work put into it that may conflict with your implementation\n\n[2] The demand, implementation or functionality for this feature is not yet clear\n\n[3] No plans to add this feature for the time being\n\n</details>\n\n<br>\n\n## Thank you\n\nTo all the people who were generous enough to [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/glanceapp) the project and to everyone who has contributed in any way, be it PRs, submitting issues, helping others in the discussions or Discord server, creating guides and tools or just mentioning Glance on social media. Your support is greatly appreciated and helps keep the project going.\n",

Android 应用的自由软件。[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aistra0528/Hail/releases)\n\n[<img src=\"https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png\" alt=\"Get it on F-Droid\" height=\"80\">](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aistra.hail/)\n\n<img src=\"fastlane/metadata/android/zh-CN/images/phoneScreenshots/1.png\" width=\"32%\" /> <img

冻结\n\n冻结`freeze`是一个营销用语，用于描述使**应用在用户不需要时不可运行**\n的行为，以此控制设备使用、减少内存占用和节省电量。用户可在需要时解冻`unfreeze`应用。\n\n在一般情况下，“冻结”是指停用，此外雹也可以通过隐藏和暂停来“冻结”应用。\n\n### 停用\n\n被停用`disable`的应用不会出现在启动器中。在已安装应用列表中会显示已停用`disabled`状态。启用`enable`应用即可恢复。\n\n### 隐藏\n\n被隐藏`hide`的应用不会出现在启动器和已安装应用列表中。取消隐藏`unhide`应用即可恢复。\n\n> 在这种状态下，软件包几乎处于卸载状态，无法使用，但并没有删除数据或实际的软件包文件。\n\n### 暂停 (Android 7.0+)\n\n被暂停`suspend`的应用在启动器中会显示为灰度图标。取消暂停`unsuspend`应用即可恢复。\n\n> 在这种状态下，应用程序的通知将被隐藏，任何启动活动将被停止，不能弹出提示、对话框或播放音频。\n> 当用户试图启动一个暂停的应用程序时，系统将向用户显示一个对话框，告知他们在暂停状态下不能使用这个应用程序。\n\n暂停只会阻止用户与应用交互，而**不会**阻止应用在后台运行。\n\n## 工作模式\n\n**冻结的应用需要通过相同工作模式解冻。**\n\n1. 如果您的设备支持无线调试 (Android 11+) 或已 root，推荐选择`Shizuku`。\n\n2. 如果您的设备已 root，可选择`Root`。**此模式速度相对较慢。**\n\n| 授权方式                                                                                           | 强行停止 | 停用 | 隐藏 | 暂停 | 卸载/重新安装（系统应用）

encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<permissions>\n    <privapp-permissions package=\"com.aistra.hail\">\n        <permission name=\"android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS\"/>\n        <permission name=\"android.permission.FORCE_STOP_PACKAGES\"/>\n        <permission name=\"android.permission.CHANGE_COMPONENT_ENABLED_STATE\"/>\n        <permission name=\"android.permission.MANAGE_APP_OPS_MODES\"/>\n    </privapp-permissions>\n</permissions>\n```\n\n并将雹安装为特权系统应用。\n\n推荐方法是在构建 ROM 时导入雹，`Android.bp`配置示例：\n\n```bp\nandroid_app_import {\n    name: \"Hail\",\n    apk: \"Hail.apk\",\n    privileged: true,\n\n    dex_preopt: {\n        enabled: false,\n    },\n    presigned: true,\n    preprocessed: true,\n\n    required: [\"privapp-permissions_com.aistra.hail.xml\"]\n}\n\nprebuilt_etc {\n    name: \"privapp-permissions_com.aistra.hail.xml\",\n    src: \"privapp-permissions.xml\",\n    sub_dir: \"permissions\",\n}\n```\n\n## 恢复\n\n### 通过 adb\n\n替换 com.package.name 为目标应用的包名。\n\n```shell\n# 启用应用\nadb shell pm enable com.package.name\n# 取消隐藏应用 (需要 root)\nadb shell su -c pm unhide com.package.name\n# 取消暂停应用\nadb shell pm unsuspend com.package.name\n```\n\n### 修改文件\n\n访问`/data/system/users/0/package-restrictions.xml`，此文件存储了应用限制相关信息。您可修改、重命名或直接删除此文件。\n\n- 启用应用：修改`enabled`属性为 2 (DISABLED) 或 3 (DISABLED_USER) 的值为 1 (ENABLED)\n\n- 取消隐藏应用：修改`hidden`属性为 true 的值为 false\n\n- 取消暂停应用：修改`suspended`属性为 true 的值为 false\n\n### 通过恢复模式清除数据 (wipe data)\n\n**希望您能谨慎地选择冻结应用，以免陷入此窘境。**\n\n##

Run `ios --help` after the installation for details. \nFor iOS 17+ devices you need to run `sudo ios tunnel start` for go ios to work. This will start a tunnel daemon. \nTo make this work on Windows, download the latest wintun.dll from here `https://git.zx2c4.com/wintun` and copy it to `C:/Windows/system32`\n\nThe goal of this project is to provide a stable and production ready opensource solution to automate iOS device on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. I am delighted to announce that a few companies including [headspin.io](https://www.headspin.io/) and [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) will use or are using go-iOS. \n\nFollow my twitter for updates or check out my medium blog: https://daniel-paulus.medium.com/\n\nIf you are interested in using go-iOS please get in touch on LinkedIn, Twitter or the Github discussions above, I always love to hear what people are doing with it. \n\nIf you miss something your Mac can do but go-iOS can't, just request a feature in the issues tab.\n# New REST-API\nGo-iOS is getting an experimental REST-API check it out [https://github.com/danielpaulus/go-ios/tree/main/restapi](https://github.com/danielpaulus/go-ios/tree/main/restapi) \n\n# Design principles:\n1. Using golang to compile static, small and fast binaries for all platforms very easily. \n   \n   *Build Manual*: Install golang and run `go build`\n2. All output as JSON so you can easily use go-iOS from any other programming language\n3. Everything is a module, you can use go-iOS in golang projects as a module dependency easily\n\n# Features:\n Most notable:\n - Install apps zipped as ipa or unzipped from their .app folder `ios install --path=/path/to/app`\n - Run XCTests including WebdriverAgent on Linux, Windows and Mac\n - Start and Stop apps\n - Use a debug proxy to reverse engineer every tool Mac OSX has, so you can contrib to go-ios or build      your own\n - Pair devices without manual tapping on a popup\n - Install developer images automatically by running `ios image auto`\n - Set thermal states and network emulation on the device with the `ios devicestate` command\n\nAll features:\n\n```\nOptions:\n  -v --verbose              Enable Debug Logging.\n  -t --trace                Enable Trace Logging (dump every message).\n  --nojson                  Disable JSON output\n  --pretty                  Pretty-print JSON command output\n  -h --help                 Show this screen.\n  --udid=<udid>             UDID of the device.\n  --tunnel-info-port=<port> When go-ios is used to manage tunnels for iOS 17+ it exposes them on an HTTP-API for localhost (default port: 28100)\n  --address=<ipv6addrr>     Address of the device on the interface. This parameter is optional and can be set if a tunnel created by MacOS needs to be used.\n  >                         To get this value run \"log stream --debug --info --predicate 'eventMessage LIKE \"*Tunnel established*\" OR eventMessage LIKE \"*for server port*\"'\",\n  >                         connect a device and open Xcode\n  --rsd-port=<port>         Port of remote service discovery on the device through the tunnel\n  >                         This parameter is similar to '--address' and can be obtained by the same log filter\n  --proxyurl=<url>          Set this if you want go-ios to use a http proxy for outgoing requests, like for downloading images or contacting Apple during device activation.\n  >                         A simple format like: \"http://PROXY_LOGIN:PROXY_PASS@proxyIp:proxyPort\" works. Otherwise use the HTTP_PROXY system env var.\n  --userspace-port=<port>   Optional. Set this if you run a command supplying rsd-port and address and your device is using userspace tunnel\n\nThe commands work as following:\n\tThe default output of all commands is JSON. Should you prefer human readable outout, specify the --nojson option with your command.\n\tBy default, the first device found will be used for a command unless you specify a --udid=some_udid switch.\n\tSpecify -v for debug logging and -t for dumping every message.\n\n      ios --version | version [options]                                  Prints the version\n   ios -h | --help                                                    Prints this screen.\n   ios activate [options]                                             Activate a device\n   ios apps [--system] [--all] [--list] [--filesharing]               Retrieves a list of installed applications. --system prints out preinstalled system apps. --all prints all apps, including system, user, and hidden apps. --list only prints bundle ID, bundle name and version number. --filesharing only prints apps which enable documents sharing.\n   ios assistivetouch (enable | disable | toggle | get) [--force] [options] Enables, disables, toggles, or returns the state of the \"AssistiveTouch\" software home-screen button. iOS 11+ only (Use --force to try on older versions).\n   ios ax [--font=<fontSize>] [options]                               Access accessibility inspector features.\n   ios batterycheck [options]                                         Prints battery info.\n   ios batteryregistry [options]                                      Prints battery registry stats like Temperature, Voltage.\n   ios crash cp <srcpattern> <target> [options]                       copy \"file pattern\" to the target dir.

      "readme": "# Important announcement about the app\r\n\r\nMy development environment was infected by unknown malicious software, as a result of which a few builds may have been affected. Once the issue was detected, I secured everything with a full disk wipe, restored a clean setup, and now all builds are scanned with VirusTotal. The F-Droid version will also be verified before release.\r\n\r\nPublic keys may have been compromised, which is why I am sharing this issue. You can download the new version and the new public key below, and instructions for restoring backups are provided.\r\n\r\nNo extra actions are required since the app uses **one-time connection codes**. These codes have very limited permissions (for example, they cannot change your password). Still, you can revoke them if you want full peace of mind.\r\n\r\n# How to revoke access:\r\n\r\n1. Open [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)\r\n2. Find **“Your connections to third-party apps & services”**\r\n3.

It allows you to play content from various public sources.\r\n\r\n### ✅ Features\r\n- No ads  \r\n- SponsorBlock integration  \r\n- Adjustable playback speed  \r\n- 8K resolution support  \r\n- 60fps playback  \r\n- HDR compatibility  \r\n- View live chat  \r\n- Customizable buttons  \r\n- Does not require Google Services  \r\n- Helpful international community\r\n\r\n### ❌ Limitations\r\n- Not supported on phones and tablets  \r\n- Comment functionality is unstable  \r\n- Voice search and casting performance may be inferior to official apps, depending on your device  \r\n\r\nGive it a try!\r\n\r\n**Do you have any question?** Ctrl+F or ⌘F this readme first!\r\n\r\n[**Installation**](#installation) | [**Official Site**](https://smarttubeapp.github.io) | [**Donation**](#donation) | [**FAQ**](#faq) | [Support / Chat](#support) | [Build](#build) | [Translate the app](https://jtbrinkmann.de/tools/android-strings.xml-translator.html) | [Changelog](https://t.me/s/SmartTubeNewsEN) | [Liability](#liability)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Device support\r\n\r\n![Device support image](images/new/upload_f6ab10668ea7793f099108f2b2230406.png)\r\n* **Supported:** all Android TVs and TV boxes (incl. FireTV, NVIDIA Shield & Google Chromecast with Google TV), even older ones with Android 4.3 (Kitkat).\r\n* **Not supported:** Smartphones, non-Android platforms like Samsung Tizen, LG webOS, iOS, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n> [video of the installation](images/new/zPV0imF.mp4) (note: download url changed to `kutt.it/stn_beta` or `kutt.it/stn_stable`)\r\n\r\n**Do not** download SmartTube from any **app store**, APK websites or blogs; these were uploaded by other people and may contain malware or ads. SmartTube is not officially published on any app store. Sadly, the Google PlayStore does not allow ad-free Youtube apps using unofficial APIs.\r\n\r\nThere is a **beta release** (recommended) and a **stable release**. Beta gets new features and bugfixes faster than the stable release.\r\n\r\nYou can use either of the following methods to install the app:\r\n\r\n- (**Easiest**) Install [Downloader by AFTVnews](https://www.aftvnews.com/downloader/) on your Android TV, open it and enter `kutt.it/stn_beta` or `kutt.it/stn_stable`, then read, understand and confirm the security prompts. (<small>You can also enter [**79015**](https://aftv.news/79015) (for beta) or [**28544**](https://aftv.news/28544) (for stable), but this requires an extra step to install the AFTVnews Downloader browser addon if you haven't already.</small>)\r\n- Install a file transfer app on your Android TV, download the APK on your phone or computer and transfer it to your TV (e.g. [_Send Files to TV_](https://sendfilestotv.app/) from the Google Play Store / Amazon AppStore)\r\n- Download the APK onto a USB stick, put the USB stick into your TV and use a file manager app from the Google Play Store / Amazon AppStore (e.g. [_FX File Explorer_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.fx) or [_X-plore_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore)). Android's preinstalled file manager does not work! Do **not** get the ad-infested _FileCommander_.\r\n- If you are an advanced user, you can install it using ADB. [guide](https://fossbytes.com/side-load-apps-android-tv/#h-how-to-sideload-apps-on-your-android-tv-using-adb) | [alternative guide](https://www.aftvnews.com/sideload/)\r\n\r\n**Troubleshooting:** See device specific notes below. If installation fails, either your **disk space is full** or the APK file didn't download correctly; clear up space and try downloading again. If the app installed, but crashes when opening, make sure to install it to internal memory, not to an SD card / external storage.\r\n\r\n**The app has a built-in updater** with changelog. You can also find all releases and the **changelog** on the [Telegram channel @SmartTubeNewsEN](https://t.me/s/SmartTubeNewsEN) (readable without account) or on [Github](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/releases/).\r\n\r\n> latest [**beta download**](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/releases/download/latest/smarttube_beta.apk)\r\n>\r\n> latest [stable download](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/releases/download/latest/smarttube_stable.apk)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation (Chromecast with Google TV)\r\n\r\nOn **Chromecast with Google TV**, installation of apps is blocked by default, so an extra step is required:\r\n\r\n> **4.1. Enable Developer Options**\r\n>\r\n> On your Chromecast, open the side menu and go to _Settings > System > About_. Scroll down to the _Android TV OS build_ section and click that repeatedly. A toast message will appear, explaining that you are a few steps away from being a developer. Continue clicking until you trigger it.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> **4.2. Turn on the \"unknown sources\" setting**\r\n>\r\n> Go back to the main _Settings_ page and select _Apps > Security & Restrictions > Unknown sources_. Turn on the toggle for \\[_Downloader by AFTVnews_ or\\] whichever file browser you decided to use [...].\r\n>\r\n> [[source & picture guide](https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/07/how-to-sideload-any-apk-on-the-chromecast-with-android-tv/#install-the-apk)]\r\n\r\nAfter this, you can follow the [general installation guide](#installation) above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation (Xiaomi devices with Chinese firmware)\r\n\r\nXiaomi's **Chinese firmware** might block the installation **of the beta version**. The international firmware is not affected. Solutions:\r\n1. Use SmartTube's **stable version** instead (**recommended**)\r\n2. Use the international firmware for your device\r\n3. (if your device is from 2020 or before) You can do a factory reset and then install SmartTube beta before doing any system updates. You can then safely update your system, SmartTube should continue working.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Updating\r\n\r\nThe app has a built-in updater. You only need to follow the installation procedure **once**. A few seconds after launching SmartTube, it will notify you if there is any update and also show a changelog. You can disable automatic update checks or manually update in the settings under \"about\".\r\n\r\nIf the installation fails, either your **disk space is full** or the update didn't download correctly; clear up space and try updating again (_Settings > About > Check for updates_).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nSmartTube requires Android 4.3 or above. It does not work on non-Android devices (incl. LG or Samsung TVs). On unsupported TVs, you can use a TV stick or TV box. Though this app technically runs on smartphones and tablets, it is not optimized for such and offers no official support!\r\n\r\nIt has been successfully tested on TVs, TV boxes and TV sticks that are based on Android, including:\r\n\r\n- Android TVs & Google TVs (e.g. Philips, Sony)\r\n- Chromecast with Google TV & TVs with _Chromecast built-in_\r\n- Amazon FireTV stick (all generations)\r\n- NVIDIA Shield\r\n- TV boxes running Android (many cheap chinese no-name boxes)\r\n- Xiaomi Mi Box\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Adblocking\r\n\r\nSmartTube does not show any ad banners, preroll ads or ad intermissions. It not just tries to prevent them, it is literally programmed to be completely **unable** to display any ads, so YouTube cannot slip anything in. This also means you cannot allow ads or whitelist channels. Some YouTube channels include sponsored messages in their videos, these can also be skipped, see [SponsorBlock](#SponsorBlock) below.\r\n\r\n\r\n### SponsorBlock\r\n\r\nSmartTube includes a SponsorBlock integration. From the [SponsorBlock website](https://sponsor.ajay.app/):\r\n\r\n> SponsorBlock is an open-source crowdsourced browser extension and open API for **skipping sponsor segments** in YouTube videos. [...] the extension automatically skips sponsors **it knows about** using a privacy preserving query system. It also supports skipping **other categories**, such as intros, outros and reminders to subscribe [and non-music parts in music videos].\r\n\r\nYou can select which categories you want to skip in the settings. Unlike the browser addon, in SmartTube you cannot submit new segments (TVs and TV remotes aren't great devices for such precise operations). Note that SponsorBlock is a free and voluntary project based on user submissions, so don't expect it to 100% work every time. Sometimes, sponsor segments are not yet submitted to the database, sometimes the SponsorBlock servers are offline/overloaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Casting\r\n\r\nTo cast videos from your phone (or other devices), you must link that device to your TV. Unlike the original YouTube app, SmartTube does not automatically show up when you are in the same wifi network. How to link your smartphone and TV:\r\n\r\n1. open SmartTube and go to settings\r\n2. go to \"Remote control\" (2nd option)\r\n3. open your YouTube app on your phone, go to settings > General > watch on TV\r\n4. click on _connect using TV-code_ and enter the code from your TV\r\n\r\n[**Screenshot guide**](https://t.me/SmartTubeEN/8514)\r\n\r\nDue to technical limitations, you need to open the app on the TV before casting; SmartTube cannot automatically wake up the TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Picture-in-Picture (PiP)\r\n\r\nSmartTube supports playing videos in PiP mode. This needs to be enabled under _Settings > General > Background playback > Picture in picture_. The video will go into PiP mode when you press home while playing a video, and also when you press _back_ if enabled in _Settings > General > Background playback (activation)_.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Adjust Speed\r\n\r\nYou can adjust the playback speed pressing the speed-indicator icon (gauge) in the top row of the player. This is remembered across videos. Some speeds may case frame drops, this is a known issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Voice Search\r\n\r\nTo enable global voice search, an additional app must be installed alongside SmartTube. This _bridge app_ can intercept the System's attempts to open the original YouTube app and open SmartTube instead. For this to work, you must uninstall the original YouTube app. We know this sucks, but you can always reinstall it if you change your mind. The _bridge app_ will not show up in your launcher and you cannot launch it directly; it is only used internally by the system's voice search. On some devices, you need to explicitly say \"Youtube\" when searching (e.g. say \"youtube cute cats\" instead of just \"cute cats\").\r\n\r\n**On Amazon Fire TV**: \r\n\r\n1. Uninstall the original YouTube app (no root required)\r\n2. Download and install the Amazon Bridge SmartTube app: https://kutt.it/stn_bridge_amazon (e.g. via _Downloader by AFTVnews_)\r\n\r\n\r\n**On Google Chromecast with Google TV**: \r\n\r\n1. Uninstall the original YouTube app (no root required)\r\n2. Download and install the ATV Bridge SmartTube app: https://kutt.it/stn_bridge_atv (e.g. via _Downloader by AFTVnews_)\r\n\r\n\r\n**On all other Android devices**, sadly root is required to enable this:\r\n\r\n1. Root your device (search for a guide for your specific device)\r\n2. Uninstall the official YouTube app using root (`adb shell pm uninstall com.google.android.youtube.tv`)\r\n3. Download and install the ATV Bridge SmartTube app: https://kutt.it/stn_bridge_atv (e.g. via _Downloader by AFTVnews_)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Donation\r\n\r\nIf you want to support my developments you are welcome to buy me a cup of coffee :)\r\n\r\n- [**Patreon (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal)**](https://www.patreon.com/smarttube)  \r\n- **PayPal**: firsth<!-- abc@def -->ash@gmai<!-- @abc.com -->l.com  \r\n<!-- > [**Buy me a coffee**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/stube) -->  \r\n- **BTC**: 1JAT5VVWarVBkpVbNDn8UA8HXNdrukuBSx  \r\n- **LTC**: ltc1qgc24eq9jl9cq78qnd5jpqhemkajg9vudwyd8pw  \r\n- **ETH**: 0xe455E21a085ae195a097cd4F456051A9916A5064  \r\n- **ETC**: 0x209eCd33Fa61fA92167595eB3Aea92EE1905c815  \r\n- **TRX**: TJNPY794aSGZf3WGHTna2VCWm2G5Yua7E8  \r\n- **USDT (TRC20)**: TJNPY794aSGZf3WGHTna2VCWm2G5Yua7E8  \r\n- **USDT (BEP20)**: 0x64B28da787BE6ac5889D276A5638d4f077840eC5  \r\n- **USDT (ERC20)**: 0xe455e21a085ae195a097cd4f456051a9916a5064   \r\n- **TON**: UQAc9zgnnzwS8yb5wxAu5CB0RddmjPBjWI-n46oQ7XfCQrgI  \r\n- **XMR**: 48QsMjqfkeW54vkgKyRnjodtYxdmLk6HXfTWPSZoaFPEDpoHDwFUciGCe1QC9VAeGrgGw4PKNAksX9RW7myFqYJQDN5cHGT    \r\n\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\n**Please check the [FAQ](#faq) first!** Also at least have a short look at the recent chat history.\r\n\r\nYou can report in our Telegram group or via [issue tracker on Github](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/issues) (account required).\r\n\r\n- **Telegram group (international)**: [@SmartTubeEN](http://t.me/SmartTubeEN)  \r\n- **Discord group (international)**: [SmartTube Official](https://discord.gg/Wt8HDDej5z)  \r\n- **Telegram group (RU/UA)**: [@SmartTubeUA](http://t.me/SmartTubeUA)  \r\n- **Email**: firsth<!-- abc@def -->ash@gmai<!-- @abc.com -->l.com\r\n\r\nThe international group is in **English only**.

This is an open source, hobby project. Several others have helped with translations, some of which can be seen on [Github](https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube/graphs/contributors), some have sent their translations directly to Yurii. There are also helpful people in the support chat.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n    \r\n**NOTE: OpenJDK 14 or older (!) is required. Newer JDK could cause app crash!**  \r\nTo build and install debug version, run these commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/yuliskov/SmartTube.git\r\ncd SmartTube\r\ngit submodule update --init\r\nadb connect <device_ip_address>\r\ngradlew clean installStstableDebug\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Video codecs\r\n\r\nVideo codecs are the algorithms used for video compression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which codec to choose / overview\r\n\r\n|          | recommendation                               | hardware support             | compression, bitrate\\*              | quality |\r\n|:--------:|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------- |:----------------------:|:-------:|\r\n| **AV01** aka. AV1 | best choice, **if your device supports** | first devices started coming in **2020**   | **best** <small>(e.g. 1.6 Mbps)</small>   | same   |\r\n| **VP9**  | **best choice on most devices**         | most devices **since 2015** | **better** <small>(e.g. 2.1 Mbps)</small> | same   |\r\n| AVC  | only for old or slow hardware | **all** devices             | good <small>(e.g. 2.7 Mbps)</small>   | same   |\r\n\r\n\r\n<small>\\* Examples taken from the video-only track at 1080p @ 25fps for this video: [Dua Lipa - New Rules (Official Music Video)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=k2qgadSvNyU)</small>\r\n\r\nAt the same resolution, a **lower bitrate is better!** YouTube explicitly targets the **same quality** regardless of the codec. Older codecs have a higher bitrate only because they are less efficient. On Youtube, you **do not** get better quality by simply choosing a higher bitrate. Newer codecs have a better compression = lower bitrate = use less bandwidth = save the environment. This is a feature, not a bug. You should use the newest codec that works smoothly on your device, not the least efficient one. AVC usually has the highest bitrate. This is bad, not good.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which quality to choose?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no automatic mode based on your bandwidth. But you can configure a default video preset yourself under settings \\> video player \\> video presets. The first option (\"none\") will remember your last selection within the video player. Any other preset is used initially for each video; if the selected profile is not available, the next best available option is used. You can still override the profile on each video individually within the player.\r\n\r\nTo decide the optional resolution / video quality for you, you need to consider a few limiting factors:\r\n- Your bandwidth (choose only up to the bitrate that your bandwidth can handle; you can do a speedtest using [fast.com](https://fast.com) by Netflix)\r\n- Your TV's display resolution (the quality **might slightly** improve, if you select the next higher resolution, e.g. 1080p on a 720p display; but don't expect a big difference)\r\n- Your TV's capabilities (e.g. HDR, 60fps)\r\n\r\nGenerally 60fps is an improvement, but if you personally don't notice (or mind) the difference, you can save bandwidth (and the environment) by not choosing 60fps.\r\n\r\n\r\n### HDR\r\n\r\nHDR works only **if your hardware supports it**. It's a complicated mess:\r\n- Your TV must support it\r\n- If you use a TV box, that TV box **and** your TV cable **and** the TV must support HDR\r\n- Yes, there truly are different HDMI cable versions with different HDR-support, it's complicated\r\n- some devices (like the **NVIDIA Shield**) generally support HDR, but **not** the specific HDR format that is used on YouTube :cry:\r\n \r\nIf HDR videos look looked dim or washed out, then check [this article](https://www.wired.com/story/hdr-too-dark-how-to-fix-it/). **If HDR is not working**, it's probably not this app's fault. You might need to search on the web for \"HDR\" and your device name for any help.\r\n\r\n## Liability\r\n\r\nWe take no responsibility for the use of our tool, or external instances\r\nprovided by third parties.

You can set-up such DNS either automatically or manually. To automatic set-up you can use the [Intra apk at fdroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.intra/) and the [\"AutoStart - No root\"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autostart) apk to make it autolaunch after every TV restart. For manual set-up [use this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/MiBox/s/7esEVGtAAa).\r\n\r\n### Q: There is no result for the search that I say (Android 11)\r\n\r\nA: They're some reports that the latest update for \"Google app for Android TV\" could cause this bug. Deleting the update should fix the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: AV01 does not play / Why is VP9 slow on my device?\r\n\r\nA: Because AV01 is very new, **most** TVs and TV boxes **do not** offer hardware support and **cannot** play AV01 **at all**.\r\n\r\nIf your device has hardware support for a codec, videos using that codec should play smoothly. High resolutions might also be slow in VP9 on cheap TV boxes that don't officially support 4k. Your device probably can play VP9 videos even without hardware support, however this requires a powerful CPU to run smoothly. Fixing AV01 without hardware support is technically possible, but currently not planned and probably not efficient enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can you make SmartTube look like the original app?\r\n\r\nA: Compared to SmartTube's UI, Stock Youtube and YT Kids are far ahead. However, we'd need someone who's skilled and willing to dedicate enough time and energy into making it. And into maintaining it longterm (incl. new features, bug fixes). All of this for free. If you are / got someone like that, please help.\r\nNot to mention that SmartTube follows Google's official template & recommendations for Android TV apps. It's Google's fault that the template is somewhat ugly. 😂\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can the search page be improved?\r\n\r\nA: It can be, but it takes someone to do it, similar to the above FAQ-entry. SmartTube is following Google's officially recommended design/template for TV apps and is using the official, preinstalled Android TV keyboard. Sadly, Google did a really bad job regarding the search page and keyboard. Maybe a future SmartTube update can add an embedded keyboard, similar to the original YouTube or other major Android TV apps. Maybe it can improve the looks to be as good or better than in the official YouTube app. But for now, it is the way it is due to lack of time and due to Google's official recommendations being bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I install this on a Samsung Tizen TV / LG webOS TV / Roku / iOS / toaster?\r\n\r\nA: No, this only works on **Android** devices. If you look at an Android TV's product page, it usually says clearly that it's based on Android. The app **cannot** easily be ported over to other plattforms and we have no plans to even try. **Please do not ask**. Instead, you can connect a separate TV stick or TV box to your TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I install this on a smartphone? / Can you add portrait mode? / Scrolling doesn't work.\r\n\r\nA: **Big No**. This app is **not** for smartphones, we offer **zero support** for that.\r\n\r\nYou **can cast** videos **from** your smartphone to a TV / TV box running SmartTube, though. Just use the official YouTube app or [ReVanced](https://github.com/ReVanced), see [the casting section](#casting) for more information.\r\n\r\n**There will not be a phone version.** You can use [ReVanced](https://github.com/ReVanced), [Pure Tuber](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.tube.premium.advanced.tuber), [NewPipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org), or [NewPipe x SponsorBlock](https://github.com/polymorphicshade/NewPipe#newpipe-x-sponsorblock) instead. Please go to their respective support chats for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I install this on a tablet / car screen / smartphone with docking station?\r\n\r\nYes... maybe.. Requirements:\r\n\r\n- It is an Android device\r\n- It has a large screen\r\n- It has a TV remote, controller, or keyboard\r\n  **Touch input is not supported.** Mouse/touchpad scrolling neither. You cannot properly use SmartTube with only touch or mouse input.\r\n\r\nSome users reported great success (incl. on a [car entertainment system](https://t.me/SmartTubeEN/6060)). **Please share your success stories with us.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: I get \"unknown codec\" / \"can't download video\" errors\r\n\r\nA: please wait 5 seconds for the video to play. If that doesn't help, press the play button. Some users reported, that this issue only appears when they have a USB audio device attached or if their disk storage is full.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: I get \"the video profile is not supported\"\r\n\r\nA. Press the \"HQ\"-button in the bottom-left, select _video formats_ and select anything other than AV01. AV01 is **not supported** on most devices (apparently including yours), so select VP9 instead. See [the section on video codecs](#Video-codecs) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: I get \"video unavailable\" when watching unlisted videos / my own videos\r\n\r\nA: Right, that's currently a bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: It doesn't show up on my casting list\r\n\r\nA: Please read the [Casting](#casting) section.\r\n\r\n### Q: I get an error saying \"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot\"\r\n\r\nA: Your IP address range might be temporaily/permanently blocked by YouTube from watching videos if you not signed in to your account.\r\n\r\n### Q: The video is buffering a lot\r\n\r\nA: The issue might not be specific to SmartTube, as other unofficial YouTube apps also report this issue. It seems uncommon nowadays, but was very present in the 2nd quarter of 2021. Some users or devices seem to be more affected then others. The official YouTube app & website are apparently only rarely affected. The root cause of the issue is currently unclear, but it appears to be a server-side thing on YouTube's end. Possibly, YouTube is discriminating 3rd party apps.\r\n\r\nFor now, try to see if it helps to:\r\n\r\n- Reduce the resolution (or chance it back)\r\n- Change the video format to AVC\r\n- Increase the buffer in the settings\r\n- Hit the back button and try playing the video again\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: The debug information says my display is 1080p, but I have a 4k/UHD display!\r\n\r\nA: Do not worry, **the debug information is incorrect.** SmartTube works fine even above 1080p and you should be able to see that, when you play a video in 4k or UHD.\r\nAlso do not worry if it says \"720p\" and you have a 1080p display.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Why does it not autoselect highest quality?\r\n\r\nA: **It does** (by default). If you set a _video profile_ under settings, that acts as a maximum for automatic selection. Check if you configured a video profile, you can unset it by choosing \"none\".\r\n\r\n**Please do not confuse quality with bitrate**. See [the section on video codecs](#Video-codecs) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I set a (maximum) resolution by default?\r\n\r\nA: SmartTube automatically select the highest available quality for your video, up to a maximum resolution that you can set in the settings under \"video profile\". If available, SmartTube will pick the selected video profile, or otherwise the next best one available will be used. You can still always change the video profile while watching videos.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can it set the resolution to \"auto\", depending on my available bandwidth?\r\n\r\nA: This is planned, but not available yet (sorry 🙇‍♀️). However, you can set a maximum resolution to something that should work for your bandwidth. See above for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Why does it skip video segments?\r\n\r\nA: SmartTube has a feature called **SponsorBlock**. You can select categories should be skipped, if any. See the [SponsorBlock section](#sponsorblock) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: How to start the next video automatically / stop after every video?\r\n\r\nA: You can switch between different autoplay-modes using the loop-button 🔁\r\n\r\n[![screenshot showing the loop-button](images/new/V3GHGvWprmdE1w.jpg)](https://t.me/SmartTubeEN/24953)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: How to remove recommended videos (e.g. news) that are unrelated to me?\r\n\r\nA: Recommended videos are defined by YouTube and not by the app, we cannot change the algorithm. They are based on your country, which you can change in the settings. If you are logged in, they are based on your watch history, user profile data, and whatever else Google might use. If you are not logged in, you are like in \"incognito mode\", so your watch history does not influence your recommendations. Maybe a future version will add optional user profiling without logging in.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Does HDR work?\r\n\r\nA: Yes, HDR works **if your hardware** supports it. The **NVIDIA Shield** does not. See [the section on HDR](#HDR) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Why do some updates say \"don't update if satisfied with the current version\" in the changelog?\r\n\r\nA: These updates change a lot of code, trying to fix bugs that only affect a few users/devices. Only the affected users should update. For anyone else, there is nothing to gain from updating; however there is the chance of causing new bugs. Do not worry if you updated anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: When playing at other speeds, frames are skipped!\r\n\r\nA: We currently cannot fix this, sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: What is AFR?\r\n\r\nA: \"Auto Frame Rate\". It adjusts the refresh rate of your TV to match the content you're watching. It can slightly improve the smoothness, but the difference is very small; most people barely notice it. It does not work well on every hardware. If you don't know what it does and don't want to test it out yourself, you can safely keep it off.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation:** You can turn it on to see if it works on your device; if it causes issues (or if you don't care to test), turn it **off**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Should I choose high or low buffer?\r\n\r\nA: The higher your buffer, the more of a video will be preloaded ahead of your current position. A low buffer might minimally reduce your bandwidth usage, if you often close videos before they end. A high buffer can smooth out network issues and prevent the video from pausing to buffer. A higher buffer increases RAM usage, however this shouldn't be an issue.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation: high**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I retain the buffer when seeking back?\r\n\r\nA: No, when you seek back (e.g. jump back 5 seconds), SmartTube will have to rebuffer. This might be improved in a future update.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: My device freezes when watching YouTube\r\n\r\nA: That's a firmware or Android issue. If you are using a custom rom, maybe that rom is buggy. Because this issue is nearly impossible for the developer to debug, we cannot help you, sorry. You can try the usual workarounds: rebooting, clearing cache, reinstalling the app, or factory resetting the device.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I download videos?\r\n\r\nA: Not with SmartTube\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can updates be installed automatically?\r\n\r\nA: No, this is technically not possible. Only the preinstalled app manager (usually Google PlayStore, Amazon AppStore, etc) has the required permission. All other apps, incl. SmartTube can only show open installation prompt. A workaround using root would be possible, but hasn't been implemented yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q: Can I whitelist ads on some channels?\r\n\r\nA: No, this is not possible. SmartTube does not have any code to display ads. Adding this functionality would actually take time and effort, which is instead spent on adding useful features and fixing bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "readme": "# Pi Monorepo\n\nTools for building AI agents and managing LLM deployments.\n\n## Packages\n\n| Package | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **[@mariozechner/pi-ai](packages/ai)** | Unified multi-provider LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) |\n| **[@mariozechner/pi-agent-core](packages/agent)** | Agent runtime with tool calling and state management |\n| **[@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent](packages/coding-agent)** | Interactive coding agent CLI |\n| **[@mariozechner/pi-mom](packages/mom)** | Slack bot that delegates messages to the pi coding agent |\n| **[@mariozechner/pi-tui](packages/tui)** | Terminal UI library with differential rendering |\n| **[@mariozechner/pi-web-ui](packages/web-ui)** | Web components for AI chat interfaces |\n| **[@mariozechner/pi-pods](packages/pods)** | CLI for managing vLLM deployments on GPU pods |\n\n## Development\n\n### Setup\n\n```bash\nnpm install          # Install all dependencies\nnpm run build        # Build all packages\nnpm run check        # Lint, format, and type check\n```\n\n> **Note:** `npm run check` requires `npm run build` to be run first. The web-ui package uses `tsc` which needs compiled `.d.ts` files from dependencies.\n\n### CI\n\nGitHub Actions runs on push to `main` and on pull requests. The workflow runs `npm run check` and `npm run test` for each package in parallel.\n\n**Do not add LLM API keys as secrets to this repository.** Tests that require LLM access use `describe.skipIf()` to skip when API keys are missing. This is intentional:\n\n- PRs from external contributors would have access to secrets in the CI environment\n- Malicious PR code could exfiltrate API keys\n- Tests that need LLM calls are skipped on CI and run locally by developers who have keys configured\n\nIf you need to run LLM-dependent tests, run them locally with your own API keys.\n\n### Development\n\nStart watch builds for all packages:\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThen run with tsx:\n```bash\ncd packages/coding-agent && npx tsx src/cli.ts\ncd packages/pods && npx tsx src/cli.ts\n```\n\n### Versioning (Lockstep)\n\n**All packages MUST always have the same version number.** Use these commands to bump versions:\n\n```bash\nnpm run version:patch    # 0.7.5 -> 0.7.6\nnpm run version:minor    # 0.7.5 -> 0.8.0\nnpm run version:major    # 0.7.5 -> 1.0.0\n```\n\nThese commands:\n1. Update all package versions to the same number\n2. Update inter-package dependency versions (e.g., `pi-agent` depends on `pi-ai@^0.7.7`)\n3. Update `package-lock.json`\n\n**Never manually edit version numbers.** The lockstep system ensures consistency across the monorepo.\n\n### Publishing\n\n```bash\nnpm run release:patch    # Bug fixes\nnpm run release:minor    # New features\nnpm run release:major    # Breaking changes\n```\n\nThis handles version bump, CHANGELOG updates, commit, tag, publish, and push.\n\n**NPM Token Setup**: Requires a granular access token with \"Bypass 2FA on publish\" enabled.\n- Go to https://www.npmjs.com/settings/badlogic/tokens/\n- Create a new \"Granular Access Token\" with \"Bypass 2FA on publish\"\n- Set the token: `npm config set //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN`\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to:\n\n- Easily switch between different coding agents\n- Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence\n- Quickly review work and start dev servers\n- Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on\n- Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs\n- Open projects remotely via SSH when running Vibe Kanban on a remote server\n\nYou can watch a video overview [here](https://youtu.be/TFT3KnZOOAk).\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have authenticated with your favourite coding agent. A full list of supported coding agents can be found in the [docs](https://vibekanban.com/docs). Then in your terminal run:\n\n```bash\nnpx vibe-kanban\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease head to the [website](https://vibekanban.com/docs) for the latest documentation and user guides.\n\n## Support\n\nWe use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) for feature requests. Please open a discussion to create a feature request. For bugs please open an issue on this repo.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe would prefer that ideas and changes are first raised with the core team via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/AC4nwVtJM3), where we can discuss implementation details and alignment with the existing roadmap. Please do not open PRs without first discussing your proposal with the team.\n\n## Development\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=18)\n- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (>=8)\n\nAdditional development tools:\n```bash\ncargo install cargo-watch\ncargo install sqlx-cli\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n```bash\npnpm i\n```\n\n### Running the dev server\n\n```bash\npnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis will start the backend. A blank DB will be copied from the `dev_assets_seed` folder.\n\n### Building the frontend\n\nTo build just the frontend:\n\n```bash\ncd frontend\npnpm build\n```\n\n### Build from source (macOS)\n\n1. Run `./local-build.sh`\n2. Test with `cd npx-cli && node bin/cli.js`\n\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nThe following environment variables can be configured at build time or runtime:\n\n| Variable | Type | Default | Description |\n|----------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `POSTHOG_API_KEY` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics API key (disables analytics if empty) |\n| `POSTHOG_API_ENDPOINT` | Build-time | Empty | PostHog analytics endpoint (disables analytics if empty) |\n| `PORT` | Runtime | Auto-assign | **Production**: Server port. **Dev**: Frontend port (backend uses PORT+1) |\n| `BACKEND_PORT` | Runtime | `0` (auto-assign) | Backend server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT+1) |\n| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Runtime | `3000` | Frontend dev server port (dev mode only, overrides PORT) |\n| `HOST` | Runtime | `127.0.0.1` | Backend server host |\n| `DISABLE_WORKTREE_ORPHAN_CLEANUP` | Runtime | Not set | Disable git worktree cleanup (for debugging) |\n\n**Build-time variables** must be set when running `pnpm run build`. **Runtime variables** are read when the application starts.\n\n### Remote Deployment\n\nWhen running Vibe Kanban on a remote server (e.g., via systemctl, Docker, or cloud hosting), you can configure your editor to open projects via SSH:\n\n1. **Access via tunnel**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or similar to expose the web UI\n2. **Configure remote SSH** in Settings → Editor Integration:\n   - Set **Remote SSH Host** to your server hostname or IP\n   - Set **Remote SSH User** to your SSH username (optional)\n3. **Prerequisites**:\n   - SSH access from your local machine to the remote server\n   - SSH keys configured (passwordless authentication)\n   - VSCode Remote-SSH extension\n\nWhen configured, the \"Open in VSCode\" buttons will generate URLs like `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+user@host/path` that open your local editor and connect to the remote server.\n\nSee the [documentation](https://vibekanban.com/docs/configuration-customisation/global-settings#remote-ssh-configuration) for detailed setup instructions.\n",

      "readme": "= Elasticsearch\n\nElasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store and vector database optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Elasticsearch is the foundation of Elastic's open Stack platform. Search in near real-time over massive datasets, perform vector searches, integrate with generative AI applications, and much more.\n\nUse cases enabled by Elasticsearch include:\n\n* https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/articles/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]\n* https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/vector-search[Vector search]\n* Full-text search\n* Logs\n* Metrics\n* Application performance monitoring (APM)\n* Security logs\n\n\\... and more!\n\nTo learn more about Elasticsearch's features and capabilities, see our\nhttps://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[product page].\n\nTo access information on https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/ml-research[machine learning innovations] and the latest https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/categories/lucene[Lucene contributions from Elastic], more information can be found in https://www.elastic.co/search-labs[Search Labs].\n\n[[get-started]]\n== Get started\n\nThe simplest way to set up Elasticsearch is to create a managed deployment with\nhttps://www.elastic.co/cloud/as-a-service[Elasticsearch Service on Elastic\nCloud].\n\nIf you prefer to install and manage Elasticsearch yourself, you can download\nthe latest version from\nhttps://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch].\n\n=== Run Elasticsearch locally\n\n////\nIMPORTANT: This content is replicated in the Elasticsearch repo. See `run-elasticsearch-locally.asciidoc`.\nEnsure both files are in sync.\n\nhttps://github.com/elastic/start-local is the source of truth.\n////\n\n[WARNING]\n====\nDO NOT USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENTS.\n\nThis setup is intended for local development and testing only.\n====\n\nQuickly set up Elasticsearch and Kibana in Docker for local development or testing, using the https://github.com/elastic/start-local?tab=readme-ov-file#-try-elasticsearch-and-kibana-locally[`start-local` script].\n\nℹ️ For more detailed information about the `start-local` setup, refer to the https://github.com/elastic/start-local[README on GitHub].\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n- If you don't have Docker installed, https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[download and install Docker Desktop] for your operating system.\n- If you're using Microsoft Windows, then install https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)].\n\n==== Trial license\nThis setup comes with a one-month trial license that includes all Elastic features.\n\nAfter the trial period, the license reverts to *Free and open - Basic*.\nRefer to https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions[Elastic subscriptions] for more information.\n\n==== Run `start-local`\n\nTo set up Elasticsearch and Kibana locally, run the `start-local` script:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\ncurl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh\n----\n// NOTCONSOLE\n\nThis script creates an `elastic-start-local` folder containing configuration files and starts both Elasticsearch and Kibana using Docker.\n\nAfter running the script, you can access Elastic services at the following endpoints:\n\n* *Elasticsearch*: http://localhost:9200\n* *Kibana*: http://localhost:5601\n\nThe script generates a random password for the `elastic` user, which is displayed at the end of the installation and stored in the `.env` file.\n\n[CAUTION]\n====\nThis setup is for local testing only. HTTPS is disabled, and Basic authentication is used for Elasticsearch. For security, Elasticsearch and Kibana are accessible only through `localhost`.\n====\n\n==== API access\n\nAn API key for Elasticsearch is generated and stored in the `.env` file as `ES_LOCAL_API_KEY`.\nUse this key to connect to Elasticsearch with a https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[programming language client] or the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html[REST API].\n\nFrom the `elastic-start-local` folder, check the connection to Elasticsearch using `curl`:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\nsource .env\ncurl $ES_LOCAL_URL -H \"Authorization: ApiKey ${ES_LOCAL_API_KEY}\"\n----\n\nTo use the password for the `elastic` user, set and export the `ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD` environment variable. For example:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\nsource .env\nexport ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD\n----\n\n// NOTCONSOLE\n\n=== Send requests to Elasticsearch\n\nYou send data and other requests to Elasticsearch through REST APIs.\nYou can interact with Elasticsearch using any client that sends HTTP requests,\nsuch as the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html[Elasticsearch\nlanguage clients] and https://curl.se[curl].\n\n==== Using curl\n\nHere's an example curl command to create a new Elasticsearch index, using basic auth:\n\n[source,sh]\n----\ncurl -u elastic:$ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD \\\n  -X PUT \\\n  http://localhost:9200/my-new-index \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n----\n\n// NOTCONSOLE\n\n==== Using a language client\n\nTo connect to your local dev Elasticsearch cluster with a language client, you can use basic authentication with the `elastic` username and the password stored in the `ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD` environment variable.\n\nYou'll use the following connection details:\n\n* **Elasticsearch endpoint**: `http://localhost:9200`\n* **Username**: `elastic`\n* **Password**: `$ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD` (Value you set in the environment variable)\n\nFor example, to connect with the Python `elasticsearch` client:\n\n[source,python]\n----\nimport os\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n\nusername = 'elastic'\npassword = os.getenv('ES_LOCAL_PASSWORD') # Value you set in the environment variable\n\nclient = Elasticsearch(\n    \"http://localhost:9200\",\n    basic_auth=(username, password)\n)\n\nprint(client.info())\n----\n\n==== Using the Dev Tools Console\n\nKibana's developer console provides an easy way to experiment and test requests.\nTo access the console, open Kibana, then go to **Management** > **Dev Tools**.\n\n**Add data**\n\nYou index data into Elasticsearch by sending JSON objects (documents) through the REST APIs.\nWhether you have structured or unstructured text, numerical data, or geospatial data,\nElasticsearch efficiently stores and indexes it in a way that supports fast searches.\n\nFor timestamped data such as logs and metrics, you typically add documents to a\ndata stream made up of multiple auto-generated backing indices.\n\nTo add a single document to an index, submit an HTTP post request that targets the index.\n\n----\nPOST /customer/_doc/1\n{\n  \"firstname\": \"Jennifer\",\n  \"lastname\": \"Walters\"\n}\n----\n\nThis request automatically creates the `customer` index if it doesn't exist,\nadds a new document that has an ID of 1, and\nstores and indexes the `firstname` and `lastname` fields.\n\nThe new document is available immediately from any node in the cluster.\nYou can retrieve it with a GET request that specifies its document ID:\n\n----\nGET /customer/_doc/1\n----\n\nTo add multiple documents in one request, use the `_bulk` API.\nBulk data must be newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON).\nEach line must end in a newline character (`\\n`), including the last line.\n\n----\nPUT customer/_bulk\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Monica\",\"lastname\":\"Rambeau\"}\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Carol\",\"lastname\":\"Danvers\"}\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Wanda\",\"lastname\":\"Maximoff\"}\n{ \"create\": { } }\n{ \"firstname\": \"Jennifer\",\"lastname\":\"Takeda\"}\n----\n\n**Search**\n\nIndexed documents are available for search in near real-time.\nThe following search matches all customers with a first name of _Jennifer_\nin the `customer` index.\n\n----\nGET customer/_search\n{\n  \"query\" : {\n    \"match\" : { \"firstname\": \"Jennifer\" }\n  }\n}\n----\n\n**Explore**\n\nYou can use Discover in Kibana to interactively search and filter your data.\nFrom there, you can start creating visualizations and building and sharing dashboards.\n\nTo get started, create a _data view_ that connects to one or more Elasticsearch indices,\ndata streams, or index aliases.\n\n. Go to **Management > Stack Management > Kibana > Data Views**.\n. Select **Create data view**.\n. Enter a name for the data view and a pattern that matches one or more indices,\nsuch as _customer_.\n. Select **Save data view to Kibana**.\n\nTo start exploring, go to **Analytics > Discover**.\n\n[[upgrade]]\n== Upgrade\n\nTo upgrade from an earlier version of Elasticsearch, see the\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html[Elasticsearch upgrade\ndocumentation].\n\n[[build-source]]\n== Build from source\n\nElasticsearch uses https://gradle.org[Gradle] for its build system.\n\nTo build a distribution for your local OS and print its output location upon\ncompletion, run:\n----\n./gradlew localDistro\n----\n\nTo build a distribution for another platform, run the related command:\n----\n./gradlew :distribution:archives:linux-tar:assemble\n./gradlew :distribution:archives:darwin-tar:assemble\n./gradlew :distribution:archives:windows-zip:assemble\n----\n\nDistributions are output to `distribution/archives`.\n\nTo run the test suite, see xref:TESTING.asciidoc[TESTING].\n\n[[docs]]\n== Documentation\n\nFor the complete Elasticsearch documentation visit\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html[elastic.co].\n\nFor information about our documentation processes, see the\nxref:https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/docs/README.md[docs README].\n\n[[examples]]\n== Examples and guides\n\nThe https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs[`elasticsearch-labs`] repo contains executable Python notebooks, sample apps, and resources to test out Elasticsearch for vector search, hybrid search and generative AI use cases.\n\n\n[[contribute]]\n== Contribute\n\nFor contribution guidelines, see xref:CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING].\n\n[[questions]]\n== Questions? Problems? Suggestions?\n\n* To report a bug or request a feature, create a\nhttps://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/new/choose[GitHub Issue]. Please\nensure someone else hasn't created an issue for the same topic.\n\n* Need help using Elasticsearch? Reach out on the\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co[Elastic Forum] or https://ela.st/slack[Slack]. A\nfellow community member or Elastic engineer will be happy to help you out.\n",

On some platforms OpenTTD will be available via your OS package manager or a similar service.\n\n## 1.2) OpenTTD gameplay manual\n\nOpenTTD has a [community-maintained wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/), including a gameplay manual and tips.\n\n## 1.3) Supported platforms\n\nOpenTTD has been ported to several platforms and operating systems.\n\nThe currently supported platforms are:\n\n- Linux (SDL (OpenGL and non-OpenGL))\n- macOS (universal) (Cocoa)\n- Windows (Win32 GDI / OpenGL)\n\nOther platforms may also work (in particular various BSD systems), but we don't actively test or maintain these.\n\n### 1.3.1) Legacy support\n\nPlatforms, languages and compilers change.\nWe'll keep support going on old platforms as long as someone is interested in supporting them, except where it means the project can't move forward to keep up with language and compiler features.\n\nWe guarantee that every revision of OpenTTD will be able to load savegames from every older revision (excepting where the savegame is corrupt).\nPlease report a bug if you find a save that doesn't load.\n\n## 1.4) Installing and running OpenTTD\n\nOpenTTD is usually straightforward to install, but for more help the wiki [includes an installation guide](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Installation).\n\nOpenTTD needs some additional graphics and sound files to run.\n\nFor some platforms these will be downloaded during the installation process if required.\n\nFor some platforms, you will need to refer to [the installation guide](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Installation).\n\n### 1.4.1) Free graphics and sound files\n\nThe free data files, split into OpenGFX for graphics, OpenSFX for sounds and\nOpenMSX for music can be found at:\n\n- [OpenGFX](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/opengfx-releases/latest)\n- [OpenSFX](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/opensfx-releases/latest)\n- [OpenMSX](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openmsx-releases/latest)\n\nPlease follow the readme of these packages about the installation procedure.\nThe Windows installer can optionally download and install these packages.\n\n### 1.4.2) Original Transport Tycoon Deluxe graphics and sound files\n\nIf you want to play with the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files you have to copy the data files from the CD-ROM into the baseset/ directory.\nIt does not matter whether you copy them from the DOS or Windows version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe.\nThe Windows install can optionally copy these files.\n\nYou need to copy the following files:\n- sample.cat\n- trg1r.grf or TRG1.GRF\n- trgcr.grf or TRGC.GRF\n- trghr.grf or TRGH.GRF\n- trgir.grf or TRGI.GRF\n- trgtr.grf or TRGT.GRF\n\n### 1.4.3) Original Transport Tycoon Deluxe music\n\nIf you want the Transport Tycoon Deluxe music, copy the appropriate files from the original game into the baseset folder.\n- TTD for Windows: All files in the gm/ folder (gm_tt00.gm up to gm_tt21.gm)\n- TTD for DOS: The GM.CAT file\n- Transport Tycoon Original: The GM.CAT file, but rename it to GM-TTO.CAT\n\n## 1.5) Add-on content / mods\n\nOpenTTD features multiple types of add-on content, which modify gameplay in different ways.\n\nMost types of add-on content can be downloaded within OpenTTD via the 'Check Online Content' button in the main menu.\n\nAdd-on content can also be installed manually, but that's more complicated; the [OpenTTD wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/) may offer help with that, or the [OpenTTD directory structure guide](./docs/directory_structure.md).\n\n### 1.5.1) Social Integration\n\nOpenTTD has the ability to load plugins to integrate with Social Platforms like Steam, Discord, etc.\n\nTo enable such integration, the plugin for the specific platform has to be downloaded and stored in the `social_integration` folder.\n\nSee [OpenTTD's website](https://www.openttd.org), under Downloads, for what plugins are available.\n\n### 1.6) OpenTTD directories\n\nOpenTTD uses its own directory structure to store game data, add-on content etc.\n\nFor more information, see the [directory structure guide](./docs/directory_structure.md).\n\n### 1.7) Compiling OpenTTD\n\nIf you want to compile OpenTTD from source, instructions can be found in [COMPILING.md](./COMPILING.md).\n\n## 2.0) Contact and Community\n\n'Official' channels\n\n- [OpenTTD website](https://www.openttd.org)\n- [OpenTTD official Discord](https://discord.gg/openttd)\n- IRC chat using #openttd on irc.oftc.net [more info about our irc channel](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Development/IRC%20channel)\n- [OpenTTD on Github](https://github.com/OpenTTD/) for code repositories and for reporting issues\n- [forum.openttd.org](https://forum.openttd.org/) - the primary community forum site for discussing OpenTTD and related games\n- [OpenTTD wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/) community-maintained wiki, including topics like gameplay guide, detailed explanation of some game mechanics, how to use add-on content (mods) and much more\n\n'Unofficial' channels\n\n- the OpenTTD wiki has a [page listing OpenTTD communities](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Community/Community) including some in languages other than English\n\n\n### 2.1) Multiplayer games\n\nYou can play OpenTTD with others, either cooperatively or competitively.\n\nSee the [multiplayer documentation](./docs/multiplayer.md) for more details.\n\n### 2.2) Contributing to OpenTTD\n\nWe welcome contributors to OpenTTD.  More information for contributors can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### 2.3) Reporting bugs\n\nGood bug reports are very helpful.  We have a [guide to reporting bugs](./CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports) to help with this.\n\nDesyncs in multiplayer are complex to debug and report (some software development skils are required).\nInstructions can be found in [debugging and reporting desyncs](./docs/debugging_desyncs.md).\n\n### 2.4) Translating\n\nOpenTTD is translated into many languages.  Translations are added and updated via the [online translation tool](https://translator.openttd.org).\n\n## 3.0) Licensing\n\nOpenTTD is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0.\nFor the complete license text, see the file '[COPYING.md](./COPYING.md)'.\nThis license applies to all files in this distribution, except as noted below.\n\nThe squirrel implementation in `src/3rdparty/squirrel` is licensed under the Zlib license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/squirrel/COPYRIGHT` for the complete license text.\n\nThe md5 implementation in `src/3rdparty/md5` is licensed under the Zlib license.\nSee the comments in the source files in `src/3rdparty/md5` for the complete license text.\n\nThe fmt implementation in `src/3rdparty/fmt` is licensed under the MIT license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/fmt/LICENSE.rst` for the complete license text.\n\nThe nlohmann json implementation in `src/3rdparty/nlohmann` is licensed under the MIT license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/nlohmann/LICENSE.MIT` for the complete license text.\n\nThe OpenGL API in `src/3rdparty/opengl` is licensed under the MIT license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/opengl/khrplatform.h` for the complete license text.\n\nThe catch2 implementation in `src/3rdparty/catch2` is licensed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0.\nSee `src/3rdparty/catch2/LICENSE.txt` for the complete license text.\n\nThe icu scriptrun implementation in `src/3rdparty/icu` is licensed under the Unicode license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/icu/LICENSE` for the complete license text.\n\nThe monocypher implementation in `src/3rdparty/monocypher` is licensed under the 2-clause BSD and CC-0 license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/monocypher/LICENSE.md` for the complete license text.\n\nThe OpenTTD Social Integration API in `src/3rdparty/openttd_social_integration_api` is licensed under the MIT license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/openttd_social_integration_api/LICENSE` for the complete license text.\n\nThe atomic datatype support detection in `cmake/3rdparty/llvm/CheckAtomic.cmake` is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.\nSee `cmake/3rdparty/llvm/LICENSE.txt` for the complete license text.\n\n## 4.0) Credits\n\nSee [CREDITS.md](./CREDITS.md)\n",

Mirrors the design of [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/blob/master/README.md).\n\n* Documentation: [https://supabase.com/docs/reference/swift/introduction](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/swift/introduction)\n\n## Usage\n\n### Requirements\n- iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+ / tvOS 13+ / watchOS 6+ / visionOS 1+\n- Xcode 15.3+\n- Swift 5.10+\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Check the [Support Policy](#support-policy) to learn when dropping Xcode, Swift, and platform versions will not be considered a **breaking change**.\n\n### Installation\nInstall the library using the Swift Package Manager.\n\n```swift\nlet package = Package(\n    ...\n    dependencies: [\n        ...\n        .package(\n            url: \"https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift.git\",\n            from: \"2.0.0\"\n        ),\n    ],\n    targets: [\n        .target(\n            name: \"YourTargetName\",\n            dependencies: [\n                .product(name: \"Supabase\", package: \"supabase-swift\") // Add as a dependency\n            ]\n        )\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nIf you're using Xcode, [use this guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) to add `supabase-swift` to your project. Use `https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-swift.git` for the url when Xcode asks.\n\nIf you don't want the full Supabase environment, you can also add individual packages, such as `Functions`, `Auth`, `Realtime`, `Storage`, or `PostgREST`.\n\nThen you're able to import the package and establish the connection with the database.\n\n```swift\n/// Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database\nlet client = SupabaseClient(\n    supabaseURL: URL(string: \"https://xyzcompany.supabase.co\")!,\n    supabaseKey: \"public-anon-key\"\n)\n```\n\n### Initialize with custom options\n\n```swift\nlet client = SupabaseClient(\n    supabaseURL: URL(string: \"https://xyzcompany.supabase.co\")!, \n    supabaseKey: \"public-anon-key\",\n    options: SupabaseClientOptions(\n        db: .init(\n            schema: \"public\"\n        ),\n        auth: .init(\n            storage: MyCustomLocalStorage(),\n            flowType: .pkce\n        ),\n        global: .init(\n            headers: [\"x-my-custom-header\": \"my-app-name\"],\n            session: URLSession.myCustomSession\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\nAdditional examples are available [here](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift/tree/main/Examples).\n\n## Support Policy\n\nThis document outlines the scope of support for Xcode, Swift, and the various platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS) in Supabase.\n\n### Xcode\nWe only support Xcode versions that are currently eligible for submitting apps to the App Store. Once a specific version of Xcode is no longer supported, its removal from Supabase **won't be treated as a breaking change** and will occur in a minor release.\n\n### Swift\nThe minimum supported Swift version corresponds to the minor version released with the oldest-supported Xcode version. When a Swift version reaches its end of support, it will be dropped from Supabase in a **minor release**, and **this won't be considered a breaking change**.\n\n### Platforms\nWe maintain support for the four latest major versions of each platform, including the current version.\n\nWhen a platform version is no longer supported, Supabase will drop it in a **minor release**, and **this won't count as a breaking change**. For instance, iOS 14 will no longer be supported after the release of iOS 18, allowing its removal in a minor update.\n\nFor macOS, the named yearly releases are treated as major versions for this policy, regardless of their version numbers.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Android, Linux and Windows works but aren't supported, and may stop working on future versions of the library.\n\n## Contributing\n\n- Fork the repo on GitHub\n- Clone the project to your own machine\n- Commit changes to your own branch\n- Push your work back up to your fork\n- Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes and merge\n\n## Sponsors\n\nWe are building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. We support existing communities wherever possible, and if the products don’t exist we build them and open source them ourselves. Thanks to these sponsors who are making the OSS ecosystem better for everyone.\n\n[![New Sponsor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10214025/90518111-e74bbb00-e198-11ea-8f88-c9e3c1aa4b5b.png)](https://github.com/sponsors/supabase)\n",

The code may not appear exactly as it does in the text, as additional comments and modifications may have been added since publication.\n\n\n## Getting started ##\n\nThe code in this book relies on several R libraries.  Two libraries, `RCurl` and `XML` require additional software to be installed:\n\n - [http://curl.haxx.se/](curl) (for `RCurl`)\n - [http://xmlsoft.org/](libxml2-dev) (for `XML`)\n\nTo make sure you have all of the requite libraries run the `package_installer.R` script. In your R console type the following:\n\n\t> source(\"package_installer.R\")\n\nWhen running the installer inside R you will be asked where to save the library files.  If you'd like to install the libraries globally, you can run script at the command-line with admin privileges:\n\n\t$ sudo RScript package_installer.R\n\n\n\n## Authors ##\n\n - Drew Conway, Department of Politics, New York University [http://drewconway.com/](http://drewconway.com/)\n - John Myles White, Data Science, Facebook [http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/)\n\n## License ##\n\nAll source code is copyright (c) 2012, under the Simplified BSD License.  \nFor more information on FreeBSD see: [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)\n\nAll images and materials produced by this code are licensed under the Creative Commons \nAttribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License: [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/)\n",

It exposes numerous tools from core Ghidra functionality to MCP clients.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36080514-f227-44bd-af84-78e29ee1d7f9\n\n\n# Features\nMCP Server + Ghidra Plugin\n\n- Decompile and analyze binaries in Ghidra\n- Automatically rename methods and data\n- List methods, classes, imports, and exports\n\n# Installation\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Install [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org)\n- Python3\n- MCP [SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)\n\n## Ghidra\nFirst, download the latest [release](https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP/releases) from this repository. This contains the Ghidra plugin and Python MCP client. Then, you can directly import the plugin into Ghidra.\n\n1. Run Ghidra\n2. Select `File` -> `Install Extensions`\n3. Click the `+` button\n4. Select the `GhidraMCP-1-2.zip` (or your chosen version) from the downloaded release\n5. Restart Ghidra\n6. Make sure the GhidraMCPPlugin is enabled in `File` -> `Configure` -> `Developer`\n7. *Optional*: Configure the port in Ghidra with `Edit` -> `Tool Options` -> `GhidraMCP HTTP Server`\n\nVideo Installation Guide:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75f0c176-6da1-48dc-ad96-c182eb4648c3\n\n\n\n## MCP Clients\n\nTheoretically, any MCP client should work with ghidraMCP.  Three examples are given below.\n\n## Example 1: Claude Desktop\nTo set up Claude Desktop as a Ghidra MCP client, go to `Claude` -> `Settings` -> `Developer` -> `Edit Config` -> `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"ghidra\": {\n      \"command\": \"python\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py\",\n        \"--ghidra-server\",\n        \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, edit this file directly:\n```\n/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json\n```\n\nThe server IP and port are configurable and should be set to point to the target Ghidra instance. If not set, both will default to localhost:8080.\n\n## Example 2: Cline\nTo use GhidraMCP with [Cline](https://cline.bot), this requires manually running the MCP server as well. First run the following command:\n\n```\npython bridge_mcp_ghidra.py --transport sse --mcp-host 127.0.0.1 --mcp-port 8081 --ghidra-server http://127.0.0.1:8080/\n```\n\nThe only *required* argument is the transport. If all other arguments are unspecified, they will default to the above. Once the MCP server is running, open up Cline and select `MCP Servers` at the top.\n\n![Cline select](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88e1f336-4729-46ee-9b81-53271e9c0ce0)\n\nThen select `Remote Servers` and add the following, ensuring that the url matches the MCP host and port:\n\n1. Server Name: GhidraMCP\n2. Server URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8081/sse`\n\n## Example 3: 5ire\nAnother MCP client that supports multiple models on the backend is [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire). To set up GhidraMCP, open 5ire and go to `Tools` -> `New` and set the following configurations:\n\n1. Tool Key: ghidra\n2. Name: GhidraMCP\n3. Command: `python /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py`\n\n# Building from Source\n1. Copy the following files from your Ghidra directory to this project's `lib/` directory:\n- `Ghidra/Features/Base/lib/Base.jar`\n- `Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/lib/Decompiler.jar`\n- `Ghidra/Framework/Docking/lib/Docking.jar`\n- `Ghidra/Framework/Generic/lib/Generic.jar`\n- `Ghidra/Framework/Project/lib/Project.jar`\n- `Ghidra/Framework/SoftwareModeling/lib/SoftwareModeling.jar`\n- `Ghidra/Framework/Utility/lib/Utility.jar`\n- `Ghidra/Framework/Gui/lib/Gui.jar`\n2. Build with Maven by running:\n\n`mvn clean package assembly:single`\n\nThe generated zip file includes the built Ghidra plugin and its resources. These files are required for Ghidra to recognize the new extension.\n\n- lib/GhidraMCP.jar\n- extensions.properties\n- Module.manifest\n",

You can see them [here](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryBuilds/releases).\n\nIf you'd rather compile on your own, follow these instructions.\nFirst, make sure you have [JDK 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=any&arch=any&version=17) installed. **Other JDK versions will not work.** Open a terminal in the Mindustry directory and run the following commands:\n\n### Windows\n\n_Running:_ `gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `gradlew desktop:dist`  \n_Sprite Packing:_ `gradlew tools:pack`\n\n### Linux/Mac OS\n\n_Running:_ `./gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `./gradlew desktop:dist`  \n_Sprite Packing:_ `./gradlew tools:pack`\n\n### Server\n\nServer builds are bundled with each released build (in Releases). If you'd rather compile on your own, replace 'desktop' with 'server', e.g. `gradlew server:dist`.\n\n### Android\n\n1. Install the Android SDK [here.](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools) Make sure you're downloading the \"Command line tools only\", as Android Studio is not required.\n2. In the unzipped Android SDK folder, find the cmdline-tools directory. Then create a folder inside of it called `latest` and put all of its contents into the newly created folder.\n3. In the same directory run the command `sdkmanager --licenses` (or `./sdkmanager --licenses` if on linux/mac)\n4. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to your unzipped Android SDK directory.\n5. Enable developer mode on your device/emulator. If you are on testing on a phone you can follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling), otherwise you need to google how to enable your emulator's developer mode specifically.\n6. Run `gradlew android:assembleDebug` (or `./gradlew` if on linux/mac). This will create an unsigned APK in `android/build/outputs/apk`.\n\nTo debug the application on a connected device/emulator, run `gradlew android:installDebug android:run`.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Permission Denied\n\nIf the terminal returns `Permission denied` or `Command not found` on Mac/Linux, run `chmod +x ./gradlew` before running `./gradlew`. *This is a one-time procedure.*\n\n#### Where is the `mindustry.gen` package?\n\nAs the name implies, `mindustry.gen` is generated *at build time* based on other code. You will not find source code for this package in the repository, and it should not be edited by hand.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of the \"source\" of generated code in `mindustry.gen`:\n\n- `Call`, `*Packet` classes: Generated from methods marked with `@Remote`.\n- All entity classes (`Unit`, `EffectState`, `Posc`, etc): Generated from component classes in the `mindustry.entities.comp` package, and combined using definitions in `mindustry.content.UnitTypes`.\n- `Sounds`, `Musics`, `Tex`, `Icon`, etc: Generated based on files in the respective asset folders.\n\n---\n\nGradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. <br>\nAfter building, the output .JAR file should be in `/desktop/build/libs/Mindustry.jar` for desktop builds, and in `/server/build/libs/server-release.jar` for server builds.\n\n## Feature Requests\n\nPost feature requests and feedback [here](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Downloads\n\n| [![](https://static.itch.io/images/badge.svg)](https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry)    |    [![](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en-play-badge.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.anuke.mindustry)   |    [![](https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png)](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.anuke.mindustry)\t| [![](https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.svg)](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.Anuken.Mindustry)  \n|---\t|---\t|---\t|---\t|\n",

We refer to these as \"libretro cores\".\n\n![XMB menu driver](docs/XMB-main-menu.jpg \"XMB menu driver\")\n\n![rgui menu driver](docs/rgui-main-menu.jpg \"rgui menu driver\")\n\n![glui menu driver](docs/glui-main-menu.jpg \"glui menu driver\")\n\n![ozone menu driver](docs/ozone-main-menu.jpg \"ozone menu driver\")\n\n## libretro\n\n[libretro](https://www.libretro.com) is an API that exposes generic audio/video/input callbacks.\nA frontend for libretro (such as RetroArch) handles video output, audio output, input and application lifecycle.\nA libretro core written in portable C or C++ can run seamlessly on many platforms with very little to no porting effort.\n\nWhile RetroArch is the reference frontend for libretro, several other projects have used the libretro\ninterface to include support for emulators and/or game engines. libretro is completely open and free for anyone to use.\n\n[libretro API header](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/blob/master/libretro-common/include/libretro.h)\n\n## Binaries\n\nLatest binaries are currently hosted on the [buildbot](http://buildbot.libretro.com/).\n\n## Support\n\nTo reach developers, either make an issue here on GitHub, make a thread on the [forum](https://www.libretro.com/forums/), chat on [discord](https://discord.gg/C4amCeV), or visit our IRC channel: #retroarch @ irc.freenode.org. You could create a post in [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroArch/) with *Technical Support* flair.\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee our [Documentation Center](https://docs.libretro.com/). On Unix, man-pages are provided.\nMore developer-centric stuff is found [here](https://docs.libretro.com/development/libretro-overview/).\n\n## Related projects\n\n   - Cg/HLSL shaders: [common-shaders](https://github.com/libretro/common-shaders)\n   - slang shaders: [slang-shaders](https://github.com/libretro/slang-shaders)\n   - GLSL shaders: [glsl-shaders](https://github.com/libretro/glsl-shaders)\n   - Helper scripts to build libretro implementations: [libretro-super](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-super)\n   - GitHub mirrors of projects, useful for generating diff files: [libretro-mirrors](https://github.com/libretro-mirrors/)\n\n## Philosophy\n\nRetroArch attempts to be small and lean\nwhile still having all the useful core features expected from an emulator.\nIt is designed to be very portable and features a gamepad-centric and touchscreen UI.\nIt also has a full-featured command-line interface.\n\nIn some areas, RetroArch goes beyond and emphasizes on not-so-common technical features such as multi-pass shader support,\nreal-time rewind (Braid-style), video recording (using FFmpeg), run-ahead input latency removal, etc.\n\nRetroArch also emphasizes being easy to integrate into various launcher frontends.\n\n## Platforms\n\nRetroArch has been ported to the following platforms:\n   - Android (2.x to most recent version)\n   - Apple iOS\n   - Apple macOS (PPC, x86-32 and x86-64)\n   - Apple tvOS\n   - Blackberry\n   - DOS\n   - Emscripten (WebAssembly and JavaScript)\n   - FreeBSD\n   - Haiku\n   - LG webOS\n   - Linux\n   - Original Microsoft Xbox\n   - Microsoft Xbox 360 (Libxenon/XeXDK)\n   - Microsoft Xbox One\n   - Microsoft Xbox Series S/X\n   - Miyoo\n   - NetBSD\n   - Nintendo NES/SNES Classic Edition\n   - Nintendo GameCube\n   - Nintendo Wii\n   - Nintendo Switch\n   - Nintendo Wii U\n   - Nintendo 3DS/2DS\n   - OpenBSD\n   - OpenDingux\n   - PlayStation2\n   - PlayStation3\n   - PlayStation4\n   - PlayStation Portable\n   - PlayStation Vita\n   - Raspberry Pi\n   - ReactOS\n   - Redox OS\n   - RetroFW\n   - RS90\n   - SerenityOS\n   - Solaris\n   - Windows NT 3.5\n   - Windows 95\n   - Windows 98\n   - Windows 2000\n   - Windows XP\n   - Windows Millennium\n   - Windows Vista\n   - Windows 7\n   - Windows 8\n   - Windows 10\n   - Windows 11\n\n## Dependencies (PC)\n\nThere are no true hard dependencies per se.\n\nOn Windows, RetroArch can run with only Win32 as dependency.\n\nOn Linux, there are no true dependencies. For optimal usage, the\nfollowing dependencies come as recommended:\n\n   - GL headers / Vulkan headers\n   - X11 headers and libs, or EGL/KMS/GBM\n\nOSX port of RetroArch requires latest versions of Xcode to build.\n\nRetroArch can utilize these libraries if enabled:\n\n   - nvidia-cg-toolkit\n   - libfreetype2 (TTF font rendering on screen)\n\nRetroArch needs at least one of these audio driver libraries:\n\n   - ALSA\n   - OSS\n   - RoarAudio\n   - RSound\n   - OpenAL\n   - JACK\n   - SDL\n   - PulseAudio\n   - PipeWire\n   - XAudio2 (Win32, Xbox 360)\n   - DirectSound (Win32, Xbox 1)\n   - CoreAudio (OSX, iOS)\n\nTo run properly, RetroArch requires a libretro implementation present; however, as it's typically loaded\ndynamically, it's not required at build time.\n\n## Dependencies (Console ports, mobile)\n\nConsole ports have their own dependencies, but generally do not require\nanything other than what the respective SDKs provide.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### OpenGL1 ###\nYour videocard needs to at least support the OpenGL 1.1 spec.\n\n***Shaders***: N/A\n\n**Menu driver support**: MaterialUI, XMB, Ozone and RGUI should all work correctly.\nXMB won't have shader pipeline effects because of the aforementioned lack of shader\nsupport.\n\n### OpenGL2 ###\nYour videocard needs to at least support the OpenGL 2.1 spec.\n\n***Shaders:*** You can choose between either NVIDIA Cg shaders (deprecated, requires separate runtime\nto be installed on your system), or GLSL shaders.\n\n***Menu driver support:*** MaterialUI, XMB, Ozone and RGUI should all work correctly.\n\n### OpenGL3 ###\nYour videocard needs to at least support the OpenGL 3.2 core feature spec.\n\n***Shaders:*** You will be able to use modern Slang shaders with this driver.\n\n***Menu driver support:*** MaterialUI, XMB, Ozone and RGUI should all work correctly.\n\n### Direct3D 11 ###\nYour videocard needs to at least support the Direct3D11 11.0 spec. The card\nalso needs to support at least the Shader Model 4.0.\n\n***Shaders:*** You will be able to use modern Slang shaders with this driver.\n\n***Menu driver support:*** MaterialUI, XMB, Ozone and RGUI should all work correctly.\n\n### Vulkan ###\nYour videocard needs to at least support the Vulkan 1.0 spec.\n\n***Shaders:*** You will be able to use modern Slang shaders with this driver.\n\n***Menu driver support:*** MaterialUI, XMB, Ozone and RGUI should all work correctly.\n\n## Configuring\n\nThe default configuration is defined in `config.def.h`.\nIt is not recommended to change this unless you know what you're doing.\nThese can later be tweaked by using a config file.\nA sample configuration file is installed to `/etc/retroarch.cfg`. This is the system-wide config file.\n\nRetroArch will on startup create a config file in `$XDG\\_CONFIG\\_HOME/retroarch/retroarch.cfg` if it does not exist.\nUsers only need to configure a certain option if the desired value deviates from the value defined in config.def.h.\n\nTo configure joypads, use the built-in menu or manually configure them in `retroarch.cfg`.\n\n## Compiling and installing\n\nInstructions for compiling and installing RetroArch can be found in the [Libretro/RetroArch Documentation Center](https://docs.libretro.com/).\n\n## CRT 15Khz Resolution Switching\n\nCRT SwitchRes will turn on, on the fly. However, you will need to restart RetroArch to disable it. With CRT SwitchRes enable RetroArch will start in 2560 x 480 @ 60.\n\nIf you are running Windows, before enabling the CRT SwitchRes options please make sure you have installed CRTEmudriver and installed some modelines. The minimum modelines for all games to switch correctly are:\n\n- 2560 x 192 @ 60.000000\n- 2560 x 200 @ 60.000000\n- 2560 x 240 @ 60.000000\n- 2560 x 224 @ 60.000000\n- 2560 x 237 @ 60.000000\n- 2560 x 256 @ 50.000000\n- 2560 x 254 @ 55.000000\n- 2560 x 448 @ 60.000000\n- 2560 x 480 @ 60.000000\n\nInstall these modelines replacing 2560 with your desired super resolution. The above resolutions are NTSC only so if you would be playing any PAL content please add PAL modelines:\n\n- 2560 x 192 @ 50.000000\n- 2560 x 200 @ 50.000000\n- 2560 x 240 @ 50.000000\n- 2560 x 224 @ 50.000000\n- 2560 x 288 @ 50.000000\n- 2560 x 237 @ 50.000000\n- 2560 x 254 @ 55.000000\n- 2560 x 448 @ 50.000000\n- 2560 x 480 @ 50.000000\n\nSome games will require higher PAL resolutions which should also be installed:\n\n- 2560 x 512 @ 50.000000\n- 2560 x 576 @ 50.000000\n\nIdeally install all these modelines and everything will work great.\n\n## Super Resolutions\n\nThe default super resolution is 2560. It is displayed just under the CRT switch option, which can be found in video settings. This can be changed within the retroarch.cfg. The only compatible resolutions are 1920, 2560 and 3840. Any other resolutions will be ignored and native switching will be activated.\n\n## Native Resolutions\n\nIf native resolutions are activated you will need a whole new set of modelines:\n\n- 256 x 240 @ 50.006977 SNESpal\n- 256 x 448 @ 50.006977 SNESpal\n- 512 x 224 @ 50.006977 SNESpal\n- 512 x 240 @ 50.006977 SNESpal\n- 512 x 448 @ 50.006977 SNESpal\n- 256 x 240 @ 60.098812 SNESntsc\n- 256 x 448 @ 60.098812 SNESntsc\n- 512 x 240 @ 60.098812 SNESntsc\n- 512 x 224 @ 60.098812 SNESntsc\n- 512 x 448 @ 60.098812 SNESntsc\n- 256 x 192 @ 59.922745 MDntsc\n- 256 x 224 @ 59.922745 MDntsc\n- 320 x 224 @ 59.922745 MDntsc\n- 320 x 240 @ 59.922745 MDntsc\n- 320 x 448 @ 59.922745 MDntsc\n- 320 x 480 @ 59.922745 MDntsc\n- 256 x 192 @ 49.701458 MDpal\n- 256 x 224 @ 49.701458 MDpal\n- 320 x 224 @ 49.701458 MDpal\n- 320 x 240 @ 49.701458 MDpal\n- 320 x 288 @ 49.701458 MDpal\n- 320 x 448 @ 49.701458 MDpal\n- 320 x 480 @ 49.701458 MDpal\n- 320 x 576 @ 49.701458 MDpal\n- 256 x 288 @ 49.701458 MSYSpal\n- 256 x 240 @ 60.098812 NESntsc\n- 256 x 240 @ 50.006977 NESpal\n\n- 640 x 237 @ 60.130001 N64ntsc\n- 640 x 240 @ 60.130001 N64ntsc\n- 640 x 480 @ 60.130001 N64ntsc\n- 640 x 288 @ 50.000000 N64pal\n- 640 x 480 @ 50.000000 N64pal\n- 640 x 576 @ 50.000000 N64pal\n\n- 256 x 252 @ 49.759998 PSXpal\n- 320 x 252 @ 49.759998 PSXpal\n- 384 x 252 @ 49.759998 PSXpal\n- 640 x 252 @ 49.759998 PSXpal\n- 640 x 540 @ 49.759998 PSXpal\n\n- 384 x 240 @ 59.941002 PSXntsc\n- 256 x 480 @ 59.941002 PSXntsc\n\n- 352 x 240 @ 59.820000 Saturn/SGFX_NTSCp\n- 704 x 240 @ 59.820000 SaturnNTSCp\n- 352 x 480 @ 59.820000 SaturnNTSCi\n- 704 x 480 @ 59.820000 SaturnNTSCi\n- 352 x 288 @ 49.701458 SaturnPALp\n- 704 x 288 @ 49.701458 SaturnPALp\n- 352 x 576 @ 49.701458 SaturnPALi\n- 704 x 576 @ 49.701458 SaturnPALi\n\n- 240 x 160 @ 59.730000 GBA\n- 320 x 200 @ 60.000000 Doom\n\n// Arcade\n\n- 400 x 254 @ 54.706841 MK\n- 384 x 224 @ 59.637405 CPS1\n\nThese modelines are more accurate giving exact hz. However, some games may have unwanted results. This is due to mid-scanline resolution changes on the original hardware. For the best results super resolutions are the way to go.\n\n## CRT resolution switching & MAME\n\nSome arcade resolutions can be very different from consumer CRTs. There is resolution detection to ensure MAME games will be displayed in the closest available resolution but drawn at their native resolution within this resolution. Meaning that the MAME game will look just like the original hardware.\n\nMAME ROMs that run in a vertical aspect like DoDonPachi need to be rotated within MAME before resolution switching and aspect correction will work. Do this before enabling CRT SwitchRes so that RetroArch will run in your desktop resolution. Once you have rotated any games that may need it turn CRT SwitchRes on.\n\n## Socials\n\nThe links below belong to our official channels.

      "readme": "# Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM)\n\nThe Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) of the Pacific \nNorthwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is the home and primary \ndevelopment institution for GCAM, a multisector model for exploring \nconsequences of and responses to global to local changes and stressors. \nRegional energy, water, land, and economic systems are connected to the\nrest of the globe through trade and interactions with environmental systems.\nThese systems are also connected with each other.\nMultisector models such as GCAM capture these \ninterconnected impacts in an economic framework in order to explore \nthese dynamic interactions and feedbacks between regions and sectors.\n\nGCAM has been developed at PNNL-JGCRI for over 20 years and is a freely\navailable community model and documented online (See below). The team\nat JGCRI is comprised of physical scientists, engineers, economists, energy\nexperts, forest ecologists, agricultural scientists, and environmental system\nscientists who develop the model and apply it to a range of research questions.\nThe JGCRI team works closely with the developers of other Earth system and\necosystem models to integrate the effects of human actions modeled in GCAM\ninto their research.\n\n## Model Overview\n\nGCAM is a dynamic-recursive model with technology-rich representations\nof the economy, energy sector, land use, and water linked to a reduced complexity\nEarth system model that can be used to explore many science and decision-relevant\nquestions including the effects of changes in trade patterns, critical minerals\n& materials availability, and deployment of energy technologies on human and\nEarth systems. Regional population and labor productivity growth assumptions\ndrive the energy and land-use systems, employing numerous technology options to\nproduce, transform, and provide energy services, as well as to produce\nagriculture and forest products, and to determine land use and land cover.\nUsing a run period extending from 1990 – 2100 (historical years through 2021)\nwith annual results computed at 1-5 year intervals, GCAM has been used to\nexplore the potential role of emerging energy supply technologies and\nthe consequences of specific measures or energy technology adoption, including\nbioenergy; critical minerals & materials; hydrogen systems; nuclear energy;\nrenewable energy technologies; carbon capture, storage, and utilization and\nenergy use technology in buildings, industry, and the transportation\nsectors. GCAM outputs include projections of future energy and critical mineral\nsupply, trade, and demand and the resulting radiative forcing and other effects\nof 16 greenhouse gases, aerosols, and short-lived species at 0.5×0.5 degree\nresolution, contingent on assumptions about future population, economy, technology,\ntrade and other polices.\n\n## Community guidelines for peer-reviewed journal articles using GCAM\n\nThis section outlines some suggested language which the GCAM user community \ncan employ to describe GCAM in papers in peer-reviewed journal articles,\nreports, or other public documents using GCAM or versions of GCAM. GCAM is\nunder continuous development. The suggested language for the opening paragraphs\nof a methodology or introduction section of a paper describing GCAM is as\nfollows:\n\n\"The Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) is a multisector model developed and maintained at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI, 2023) _\\<include additional citations to previous GCAM studies as relevant\\>_. GCAM is an open-source community model. In this study, we use GCAM v NN. The documentation of the model is available at the GCAM documentation page ([http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc](http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc)) and the description below is a summary. GCAM includes representations of: economy, energy, agriculture, and water supply in 32 geopolitical regions across the globe; their GHG and air pollutant emissions and global GHG concentrations, radiative forcing, and temperature change; and the associated land allocation, water use, and agriculture production across 396 land sub-regions and 235 water basins.  _\\<If using GCAM-USA, include without quotes: \"This study uses a U.S.-focused version of GCAM called GCAM-USA that includes representation of energy, economy, and water systems for the fifty states and the District of Columbia in addition to 31 regions outside of the United States.”\\>_. The version of GCAM used in this study is available – along with full source code and instructions for use – in a public repository _\\<include citation including link to the GCAM repository with doi used in paper\\>_. \n\nSubsequent paragraphs of the description might expound on particular capabilities, systems, or sectors of focus in the paper. Details in the GCAM documentation page can be used as a reference to develop these paragraphs.\n\nCommunity users of GCAM might also undertake their own model developments and/or assumptions for papers. It is recommended that these departures from the publicly available version of the model be clearly described.

While all programs have been implemented, some\noptions might be missing or different behavior might be experienced.\n\n<div class=\"oranda-hide\">\n\nWe provide prebuilt binaries at https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/releases/latest .\nIt is recommended to install from main branch if you install from source.\n\n</div>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 -->\n\n## Goals\n\nuutils coreutils aims to be a drop-in replacement for the GNU utils. Differences with GNU\nare treated as bugs.\n\nOur key objectives include:\n- Matching GNU's output (stdout and error code) exactly\n- Better error messages\n- Providing comprehensive internationalization support (UTF-8)\n- Improved performances\n- [Extensions](docs/src/extensions.md) when relevant (example: --progress)\n\nuutils aims to work on as many platforms as possible, to be able to use the same\nutils on Linux, macOS, Windows and other platforms. This ensures, for example,\nthat scripts can be easily transferred between platforms.\n\n<div class=\"oranda-hide\">\n\n## Documentation\nuutils has both user and developer documentation available:\n\n- [User Manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/)\n- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/coreutils/)\n\nBoth can also be generated locally, the instructions for that can be found in\nthe [coreutils docs](https://github.com/uutils/uutils.github.io) repository.\n\nUse [weblate/rust-coreutils](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/rust-coreutils/) to translate the Rust coreutils into your language.\n\n<!-- ANCHOR: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) -->\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Rust (`cargo`, `rustc`)\n- GNU Make (optional)\n\n### Rust Version\n\nuutils follows Rust's release channels and is tested against stable, beta and\nnightly. The current Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is `1.85.0`.\n\n## Building\n\nThere are currently two methods to build the uutils binaries: either Cargo or\nGNU Make.\n\n> Building the full package, including all documentation, requires both Cargo\n> and GNU Make on a Unix platform.\n\nFor either method, we first need to fetch the repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/uutils/coreutils\ncd coreutils\n```\n\n### Cargo\n\nBuilding uutils using Cargo is easy because the process is the same as for every\nother Rust program:\n\n```shell\ncargo build --release\n```\n\nReplace `--release` with `--profile=release-fast` or `--profile=release-small` to use all optimizations or save binary size.\n\nThis command builds the most portable common core set of uutils into a multicall\n(BusyBox-type) binary, named 'coreutils', on most Rust-supported platforms.\n\nAdditional platform-specific uutils are often available. Building these expanded\nsets of uutils for a platform (on that platform) is as simple as specifying it\nas a feature:\n\n```shell\ncargo build --release --features macos\n# or ...\ncargo build --release --features windows\n# or ...\ncargo build --release --features unix\n```\n\nTo build SELinux-specific features, including `chcon` and `runcon`, ensure that `libselinux` \nand `libclang` are installed on your system. Then, run the following command:\n```\ncargo build --release --features unix,feat_selinux\n```\n\nIf you don't want to build every utility available on your platform into the\nfinal binary, you can also specify which ones you want to build manually. For\nexample:\n\n```shell\ncargo build --features \"base32 cat echo rm\" --no-default-features\n```\n\nIf you want to build the utilities as individual binaries, that is also possible:\n\n```shell\ncargo build --release --bins --workspace --exclude coreutils --exclude uu_runcon --exclude uu_chcon\n```\nEach utility is contained in its own package within the main repository, named \"uu_UTILNAME\". To\nbuild selected individual utilities, use the `--package` [aka `-p`] option. For example:\n\n```shell\ncargo build -p uu_base32 -p uu_cat -p uu_echo -p uu_rm\n```\n\n### GNU Make\n\nBuilding using `make` is a simple process as well.\n\nTo simply build all available utilities (with debug profile):\n\n```shell\nmake\n```\n\nIn release-fast mode:\n\n```shell\nmake PROFILE=release-fast\n```\n\nTo build all but a few of the available utilities:\n\n```shell\nmake SKIP_UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2'\n```\n\nTo build only a few of the available utilities:\n\n```shell\nmake UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2'\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n### Install with Cargo\n\nLikewise, installing can simply be done using:\n\n```shell\ncargo install --path . --locked\n```\n\nThis command will install uutils into Cargo's _bin_ folder (_e.g._\n`$HOME/.cargo/bin`).\n\nThis does not install files necessary for shell completion or manpages. For\nmanpages or shell completion to work, use `GNU Make` or see\n`Manually install shell completions`/`Manually install manpages`.\n\n### Install with GNU Make\n\nTo install all available utilities:\n\n```shell\nmake install\n```\n\nTo install all utilities with all possible optimizations:\n\n```shell\nmake PROFILE=release-fast install\n```\n\nTo install using `sudo` switch `-E` must be used:\n\n```shell\nsudo -E make install\n```\n\nTo install all but a few of the available utilities:\n\n```shell\nmake SKIP_UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' install\n```\n\nTo install only a few of the available utilities:\n\n```shell\nmake UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' install\n```\n\nTo install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):\n\n```shell\nmake PROG_PREFIX=uu- install\n```\n\n`PROG_PREFIX` requires separator `-`, `_`, or `=`.\n\nTo install the multicall binary:\n\n```shell\nmake MULTICALL=y install\n```\n\nSet install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):\n\n```shell\n# DESTDIR is also supported\nmake PREFIX=/my/path install\n```\n\nInstalling with `make` installs shell completions for all installed utilities\nfor `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`. Completions for `elvish` and `powershell` can also\nbe generated; See `Manually install shell completions`.\n\nTo skip installation of completions and manpages:\n\n```shell\nmake COMPLETIONS=n MANPAGES=n install\n```\n\n### Manually install shell completions\n\nThe `uudoc` binary generates completions for the `bash`, `elvish`,\n`fish`, `powershell` and `zsh` shells to stdout.\n\nInstall `uudoc` by\n```shell\ncargo install --bin uudoc --features uudoc --path .\n```\n\nThen use the installed binary:\n```shell\nuudoc completion <utility> <shell>\n```\n\nSo, to install completions for `ls` on `bash` to\n`/usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls`, run:\n\n```shell\nuudoc completion ls bash > /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions/ls.bash\n```\n\nCompletion for prefixed `cp` with `uu-` on `zsh` is generated by\n```shell\nenv PROG_PREFIX=uu- uudoc completion cp zsh\n```\n\n### Manually install manpages\n\nTo generate manpages, the syntax is:\n\n```bash\nuudoc manpage <utility>\n```\n\nSo, to install the manpage for `ls` to `/usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1` run:\n\n```bash\nuudoc manpage ls > /usr/local/share/man/man1/ls.1\n```\n\n## Un-installation\n\nUn-installation differs depending on how you have installed uutils. If you used\nCargo to install, use Cargo to uninstall. If you used GNU Make to install, use\nMake to uninstall.\n\n### Uninstall with Cargo\n\nTo uninstall uutils:\n\n```shell\ncargo uninstall coreutils\n```\n\n### Uninstall with GNU Make\n\nTo uninstall all utilities:\n\n```shell\nmake uninstall\n```\n\nTo uninstall every program with a set prefix:\n\n```shell\nmake PROG_PREFIX=uu- uninstall\n```\n\nTo uninstall the multicall binary:\n\n```shell\nmake MULTICALL=y uninstall\n```\n\nTo uninstall from a custom parent directory:\n\n```shell\n# DESTDIR is also supported\nmake PREFIX=/my/path uninstall\n```\n\n<!-- ANCHOR_END: build (this mark is needed for mdbook) -->\n\n## GNU test suite compatibility\n\nBelow is the evolution of how many GNU tests uutils passes. A more detailed\nbreakdown of the GNU test results of the main branch can be found\n[in the user manual](https://uutils.github.io/coreutils/docs/test_coverage.html).\n\nSee <https://github.com/orgs/uutils/projects/1> for the main meta bugs\n(many are missing).\n\n![Evolution over time](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils-tracking/blob/main/gnu-results.svg?raw=true)\n\n</div> <!-- close oranda-hide div -->\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to uutils, please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\nuutils is licensed under the MIT License - see the `LICENSE` file for details\n\nGNU Coreutils is licensed under the GPL 3.0 or later.\n",

Change batch sizes, precision, model architectures and see how latency, memory, and accuracy shift.\n- **BUILD** teaches *how* — Understand internals. Implement autograd, optimizers, and attention from scratch to see how TensorFlow and PyTorch actually work.\n- **DEPLOY** teaches *where* — Understand constraints. Face real memory limits, power budgets, and latency requirements on actual hardware.\n\n---\n\n## What You Will Learn\n\nThis textbook teaches you to think at the intersection of machine learning and systems engineering. Each chapter bridges algorithmic concepts with the infrastructure that makes them work in practice.\n\n### The ML ↔ Systems Bridge\n\n| ML Concept | Systems Concept | What You Learn |\n|------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Model parameters | Memory constraints | How to fit large models on resource-limited devices |\n| Inference latency | Hardware acceleration | How GPUs, TPUs, and accelerators execute neural networks |\n| Training convergence | Compute efficiency | How mixed-precision and optimization techniques reduce cost |\n| Model accuracy | Quantization and pruning | How to compress models while preserving performance |\n| Data requirements | Pipeline infrastructure | How to build efficient data loading and preprocessing |\n| Model deployment | MLOps practices | How to monitor, version, and update models in production |\n| Privacy constraints | On-device learning | How to train and adapt models without sending data to the cloud |\n\n### Book Structure\n\n| Part | Focus | Chapters |\n|------|-------|----------|\n| **I. Foundations** | Core concepts | Introduction, ML Systems, DL Primer, Architectures |\n| **II. Design** | Building blocks | Workflow, Data Engineering, Frameworks, Training |\n| **III. Performance** | Making it fast | Efficient AI, Optimizations, HW Acceleration, Benchmarking |\n| **IV. Deployment** | Making it work | MLOps, On-device Learning, Privacy, Robustness |\n| **V. Trust** | Making it right | Responsible AI, Sustainable AI, AI for Good |\n| **VI. Frontiers** | What's next | Emerging trends and future directions |\n\n---\n\n## What Makes This Different\n\nThis is a living textbook. We keep it updated as the field grows, with community input along the way.\n\nAI may feel like it is moving at lightning speed, but the engineering building blocks that make it work do not change as quickly as the headlines. This project is built around those stable foundations.\n\nThink of it like LEGO. New sets arrive all the time, but the bricks themselves stay the same. Once you learn how the bricks fit together, you can build anything. Here, those \"AI bricks\" are the solid systems principles that make AI work.\n\nWhether you are reading a chapter, running a lab, or sharing feedback, you are helping make these ideas more accessible to the next learner.\n\n### Research to Teaching Loop\n\nWe use the same loop for research and teaching: define the system problem, build a reference implementation, benchmark it, then turn it into curriculum and tooling so others can reproduce and extend it.\n\n| Loop Step | Research Artifacts | Teaching Artifacts |\n|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Measure** | Benchmarks, suites, metrics | Benchmarking chapter, assignments |\n| **Build** | Reference systems, compilers, runtimes | TinyTorch modules, co-labs |\n| **Deploy** | Hardware targets, constraints, reliability | Hardware labs, kits |\n\n---\n\n## Support This Work\n\nWe are working toward **1 million learners by 2030** so that AI engineering becomes a shared, teachable discipline, not a collection of isolated practices. Every star, share, and contribution helps move this effort forward.\n\n### Why GitHub Stars Matter\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n*What gets measured gets improved.*\n\nEach star is a learner, educator, or supporter who believes AI systems should be engineered with rigor and real world constraints in mind.\n\n[![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/harvard-edge/cs249r_book?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&color=gold)](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/stargazers)\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=harvard-edge/cs249r_book&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#harvard-edge/cs249r_book&Date)\n\n1 learner → 10 learners → 100 learners → 1,000 learners → **10,000 learners** → 100,000 learners → **1M learners**\n\n</div>\n\nStars are not the goal. They are a signal.\n\nA visible, growing community makes it easier for universities, foundations, and industry partners to adopt this material, donate hardware, and fund workshops. That momentum lowers the barrier for the next institution, the next classroom, and the next cohort of learners.\n\nSupport raised through this signal flows into [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook) and funds concrete outcomes such as TinyML4D workshops, hardware kits for underserved classrooms, and the infrastructure required to keep this resource free and open.\n\nOne click can unlock the next classroom, the next contributor, and the next generation of AI engineers.\n\n### Fund the Mission\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\nAll contributions go to [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook), a transparent fund that supports educational outreach.\n\n[![Open Collective](https://img.shields.io/badge/💝%20Support%20AI%20Education-Open%20Collective-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://opencollective.com/mlsysbook)\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Community and Resources\n\n| Resource | Description |\n|---|---|\n| [📖 **Textbook**](https://mlsysbook.ai) | Interactive online textbook |\n| [🔥 **TinyTorch**](https://mlsysbook.ai/tinytorch) | Build ML frameworks from scratch |\n| [🔧 **Hardware Kits**](https://mlsysbook.ai/kits) | Deploy to Arduino, Raspberry Pi, edge devices |\n| [🌐 **Ecosystem**](https://mlsysbook.org) | Resources, workshops, and community |\n| [💬 **Discussions**](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/discussions) | Questions and ideas |\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to the book, TinyTorch, and hardware kits!\n\n| I want to... | Go here |\n|--------------|---------|\n| Fix a typo or improve a chapter | [book/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](book/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) |\n| Add a TinyTorch module or fix a bug | [tinytorch/CONTRIBUTING.md](tinytorch/CONTRIBUTING.md) |\n| Improve hardware labs | [kits/README.md](kits/README.md) |\n| Report an issue | [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/issues) |\n| Ask a question | [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book/discussions) |\n\n---\n\n## Citation & License\n\n### Citation\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{reddi2024mlsysbook,\n  title        = {MLSysBook.AI: Principles and Practices of Machine Learning Systems Engineering},\n  author       = {Reddi, Vijay Janapa},\n  booktitle    = {2024 International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ ISSS)},\n  pages        = {41--42},\n  year         = {2024},\n  organization = {IEEE},\n  url          = {https://mlsysbook.org}\n}\n```\n\n### License\n\nThis project uses a dual-license structure:\n\n| Component | License | What It Means |\n|-----------|---------|---------------|\n| **Book content** | [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](LICENSE.md) | Share freely with attribution; no commercial use; no derivatives |\n| **TinyTorch code** | [Apache 2.0](tinytorch/LICENSE) | Use, modify, and distribute freely; includes patent protection |\n\nThe textbook content (chapters, figures, explanations) is educational material that should circulate with attribution and without commercial exploitation.

      "readme": "<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"assets/feature-graphic.png\" alt=\"DNSNet feature graphic\" width=\"50%\"/>\n</div>\n\nBased on DNS66, DNSNet aims to continue the goals of the original\napp with modern Android development practices.\n\nThis is a DNS-based host blocker for Android. In the default configuration,\nseveral widely-respected host files are used to block ads, malware, and other\nweird stuff.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/dnsnet/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/dnsnet/287x66-black.png\" alt=\"Translation status\" height=\"80\" />\n</a>\n</div>\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"metadata/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/start.png\" width=\"20%\" /> <img src=\"metadata/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/filters.png\" width=\"20%\" /> <img src=\"metadata/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/apps.png\" width=\"20%\" /> <img src=\"metadata/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/dns.png\" width=\"20%\" />\n</div>\n\nInstalling\n----------\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.clombardo.dnsnet/\">\n<img src=\"https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png\" alt=\"Get it on F-Droid\" height=\"80\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.clombardo.dnsnet\">\n<img src=\"https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en-play-badge.png\" alt=\"Get it on Google Play\" height=\"80\">\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://accrescent.app/app/dev.clombardo.dnsnet\">\n<img src=\"https://accrescent.app/badges/get-it-on.png\" alt=\"Get it on Accrescent\" height=\"80\">\n</a>\n</div>\n\nOr download the latest APK from the [Releases Section](https://github.com/t895/DNSNet/releases/latest).\n\nHow it works\n------------\nThe app establishes a \"VPN (Virtual Private Network) service.\" Traditionally, these are intended to\nsend internet traffic from your device to a remote server with the intent of anonymizing the source\nof your requests. In the case of DNSNet, this is not the case.\n\nDNSNet uses Android's \"VPN service\" API as a way to read and filter your internet traffic entirely\non-device. It starts by getting access to a \"tunnel\" that provides your network requests. Then, it\nreads the hostname (e.g. google.com) of each DNS request. Finally, it blocks or allows each request\nbased on the configuration as seen in the \"Filters\" screen of the app.\n\nIt's important to note that this approach is not perfect and has some notable downsides:\n* While this app has been tuned to be as efficient as possible, it is still a service that must run\nconstantly and will have some battery cost over alternate methods of blocking through services like\nAdAway with root, Rethink, and others.\n* Since this runs as a \"VPN service,\" you will be unable to run another \"VPN service\" alongside it\nsince Android only allows for one at a time.\n\nFor further information, see the [FAQ](https://github.com/t895/DNSNet/wiki/FAQ).\n\nPrivacy Guarantee\n-----------------\nPrivacy is the most important aspect of DNSNet. Currently, DNSNet is strictly\ndata reducing: Running it can only reduce the amount of data leaving your\ndevice, not increase it (except for fetching hosts files, obviously), as for\neach request, we will either allow it to leave your device or not - we will\nnot send other requests or add other information to the request.\n\nContributing\n------------\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nBuilding\n--------\nYou'll need a few things installed to get up and running\n- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n- Java 17+\n- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (Optionally)\n\nBuilding on Windows is currently broken due to issues with compiling quiche, the crate I use for making HTTP/3 requests.\nHere's the related issue - https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/issues/2020\n\nAdd all of the Rust build targets\n```bash\nrustup target add x86_64-linux-android aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi\n```\n\nAdd a `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable that points to `.../<Current NDK version>`\n\nAndroid Studio *will* be picky about where you declare the variable. On Ubuntu I added it to my\n`/etc/environment` file and on macOS I added it to my `~/.zprofile` file.\n\nInstall `cmake` and `make`\n\nThen run this in the root of the project to build the app\n```bash\n./gradlew assembleDebug\n```\n\nNote - Android Studio Ladybug on macOS has an issue where it won't be able to find \"rustc\" and \"cargo\" when building.\nYou'll need to build via the command line in order for things to work properly.\n\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/377339196?pli=1\n\nAlternatively, you can launch Android Studio with this command to workaround the issue.\n```bash\nopen -na \"Android Studio.app\"\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the [License](COPYING), or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nCode of Conduct\n---------------\nPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of\nConduct.

Meticulously architected from the ground-up for low-latency (<50ms) instant searches.\n- **Tunable Ranking:** Easy to tailor your search results to perfection.\n- **Sorting:** Dynamically sort results based on a particular field at query time (helpful for features like \"Sort by Price (asc)\").\n- **Faceting & Filtering:** Drill down and refine results.\n- **Grouping & Distinct:** Group similar results together to show more variety.\n- **Federated Search:** Search across multiple collections (indices) in a single HTTP request.\n- **Geo Search:** Search and sort by results around a latitude/longitude or within a bounding box.\n- **Vector Search:** Index embeddings from your machine learning models in Typesense and do a nearest-neighbor search. Can be used to build similarity search, semantic search, visual search, recommendations, etc.\n- **Semantic / Hybrid Search:** Automatically generate embeddings from within Typesense using built-in models like S-BERT, E-5, etc or use OpenAI, PaLM API, etc, for both queries and indexed data. This allows you to send JSON data into Typesense and build an out-of-the-box semantic search + keyword search experience.\n- **Conversational Search (Built-in RAG):** Send questions to Typesense and have the response be a fully-formed sentence, based on the data you've indexed in Typesense. Think ChatGPT, but over your own data.\n- **Natural Language Search:** LLM-powered intent detection & query understanding, that converts any free-form natural language phrases into structured filters, sorts and queries.\n- **Image Search:** Search through images using text descriptions of their contents, or perform similarity searches, using the CLIP model.\n- **Voice Search:** Capture and send query via voice recordings - Typesense will transcribe (via Whisper model) and provide search results.\n- **Scoped API Keys:** Generate API keys that only allow access to certain records, for multi-tenant applications.\n- **JOINs:** Connect one or more collections via common reference fields and join them during query time. This allows you to model SQL-like relationships elegantly.\n- **Synonyms:** Define words as equivalents of each other, so searching for a word will also return results for the synonyms defined.\n- **Curation & Merchandizing:** Boost particular records to a fixed position in the search results, to feature them.\n- **Raft-based Clustering:** Setup a distributed cluster that is highly available.\n- **Seamless Version Upgrades:** As new versions of Typesense come out, upgrading is as simple as swapping out the binary and restarting Typesense.\n- **No Runtime Dependencies:** Typesense is a single binary that you can run locally or in production with a single command.\n\n**Don't see a feature on this list?** Search our issue tracker if someone has already requested it and add a comment to it explaining your use-case, or open a new issue if not. We prioritize our roadmap based on user feedback, so we'd love to hear from you.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nHere's Typesense's public roadmap: [https://typesense.link/roadmap](https://typesense.link/roadmap).\n\nThe first column also explains how we prioritize features, how you can influence prioritization and our release cadence. \n\n## Benchmarks\n\n- A dataset containing **2.2 Million recipes** (recipe names and ingredients):\n  - Took up about 900MB of RAM when indexed in Typesense\n  - Took 3.6mins to index all 2.2M records\n  - On a server with 4vCPUs, Typesense was able to handle a concurrency of **104 concurrent search queries per second**, with an average search processing time of **11ms**.\n- A dataset containing **28 Million books** (book titles, authors and categories):\n  - Took up about 14GB of RAM when indexed in Typesense\n  - Took 78mins to index all 28M records\n  - On a server with 4vCPUs, Typesense was able to handle a concurrency of **46 concurrent search queries per second**, with an average search processing time of **28ms**.\n- With a dataset containing **3 Million products** (Amazon product data), Typesense was able to handle a throughput of **250 concurrent search queries per second** on an 8-vCPU 3-node Highly Available Typesense cluster.\n\nWe'd love to benchmark with larger datasets, if we can find large ones in the public domain. If you have any suggestions for structured datasets that are open, please let us know by opening an issue. We'd also be delighted if you're able to share benchmarks from your own large datasets. Please send us a PR! \n\n## Who's using this?\n\nTypesense is used by a range of users across different domains and verticals.\n\nOn Typesense Cloud we serve more than **10 BILLION** searches per month. Typesense's Docker images have been downloaded over 12M times.\n\nWe've recently started documenting who's using it in our [Showcase](SHOWCASE.md).\nIf you'd like to be included in the list, please feel free to edit [SHOWCASE.md](SHOWCASE.md) and send us a PR.\n\nYou'll also see a list of user logos on the [Typesense Cloud](https://cloud.typesense.org) home page.\n\n## Install\n\n**Option 1:** You can download the [binary packages](https://typesense.org/downloads) that we publish for \nLinux (x86_64 & arm64) and Mac (x86_64).\n\n**Option 2:** You can also run Typesense from our [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/typesense/typesense).\n\n**Option 3:** Spin up a managed cluster with [Typesense Cloud](https://cloud.typesense.org):\n\n<a href=\"https://cloud.typesense.org\"><img src=\"assets/deploy_with_typesense_cloud.svg?raw=true\" alt=\"Deploy with Typesense Cloud\" height=\"60\" /></a> \n\n## Quick Start\n\nHere's a quick example showcasing how you can create a collection, index a document and search it on Typesense.\n \nLet's begin by starting the Typesense server via Docker:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8108:8108 -v/tmp/data:/data typesense/typesense:29.0 --data-dir /data --api-key=Hu52dwsas2AdxdE\n```\n\nWe have [API Clients](#api-clients) in a couple of languages, but let's use the Python client for this example.\n\nInstall the Python client for Typesense:\n \n```\npip install typesense\n```\n\nWe can now initialize the client and create a `companies` collection:\n\n```python\nimport typesense\n\nclient = typesense.Client({\n  'api_key': 'Hu52dwsas2AdxdE',\n  'nodes': [{\n    'host': 'localhost',\n    'port': '8108',\n    'protocol': 'http'\n  }],\n  'connection_timeout_seconds': 2\n})\n\ncreate_response = client.collections.create({\n  \"name\": \"companies\",\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\"name\": \"company_name\", \"type\": \"string\" },\n    {\"name\": \"num_employees\", \"type\": \"int32\" },\n    {\"name\": \"country\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": True }\n  ],\n  \"default_sorting_field\": \"num_employees\"\n})\n```\n\nNow, let's add a document to the collection we just created:\n\n```python\ndocument = {\n \"id\": \"124\",\n \"company_name\": \"Stark Industries\",\n \"num_employees\": 5215,\n \"country\": \"USA\"\n}\n\nclient.collections['companies'].documents.create(document)\n```\n\nFinally, let's search for the document we just indexed:\n\n```python\nsearch_parameters = {\n  'q'         : 'stork',\n  'query_by'  : 'company_name',\n  'filter_by' : 'num_employees:>100',\n  'sort_by'   : 'num_employees:desc'\n}\n\nclient.collections['companies'].documents.search(search_parameters)\n```\n\n**Did you notice the typo in the query text?** No big deal. Typesense handles typographic errors out-of-the-box!\n\n## Step-by-step Walk-through\n\nA step-by-step walk-through is available on our website [here](https://typesense.org/guide). \n\nThis will guide you through the process of starting up a Typesense server, indexing data in it and querying the data set. \n\n## API Documentation\n\nHere's our official API documentation, available on our website: [https://typesense.org/api](https://typesense.org/api).\n\nIf you notice any issues with the documentation or walk-through, please let us know or send us a PR here: [https://github.com/typesense/typesense-website](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-website).\n\n## API Clients\n\nWhile you can definitely use CURL to interact with Typesense Server directly, we offer official API clients to simplify using Typesense from your language of choice. The API Clients come built-in with a smart retry strategy to ensure that API calls made via them are resilient, especially in an HA setup.\n\n- [JavaScript](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-js)\n- [PHP](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-php)\n- [Python](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-python)\n- [Ruby](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-ruby)\n\nIf we don't offer an API client in your language, you can still use any popular HTTP client library to access Typesense's APIs directly. \n\nHere are some community-contributed clients and integrations:\n\n- [Go](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-go)\n- [.Net](https://github.com/DAXGRID/typesense-dotnet)\n- [Java](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-java)\n- [Rust](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-rust)\n- [Dart](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-dart)\n- [Perl](https://github.com/Ovid/Search-Typesense)\n- [Swift](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-swift)\n- [Clojure](https://github.com/runeanielsen/typesense-clj)\n- [python orm client](https://github.com/RedSnail/typesense_orm)\n- [PHP SEAL Adapter](https://github.com/schranz-search/seal-typesense-adapter)\n- [Elixir](https://github.com/jaeyson/ex_typesense)\n\nWe welcome community contributions to add more official client libraries and integrations. Please reach out to us at contact@typsense.org or open an issue on GitHub to collaborate with us on the architecture. 🙏\n\n### Framework Integrations\n\nWe also have the following framework integrations:\n\n- [Laravel](https://github.com/typesense/laravel-scout-typesense-engine)\n- [Firebase](https://github.com/typesense/firestore-typesense-search)\n- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-typesense/)\n- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search-with-typesense/?ref=typesense)\n- [WooCommerce](https://www.codemanas.com/downloads/typesense-search-for-woocommerce/?ref=typesense)\n- [Symfony](https://github.com/acseo/TypesenseBundle)\n- [InstantSearch](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-instantsearch-adapter)\n- [DocSearch](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/docsearch.html)\n- [Docusaurus](https://github.com/typesense/docusaurus-theme-search-typesense)\n- [ToolJet](https://tooljet.com/?ref=typesense)\n- [Plone CMS](https://pypi.org/project/zopyx.typesense/)\n- [Craft CMS](https://plugins.craftcms.com/typesense)\n- [SEAL](https://github.com/schranz-search/schranz-search) provides integrations of Typesense in Laravel, Symfony, Spiral, Yii and Laminas Mezzio PHP Framework\n\n### Postman Collection\n\nWe have a community-maintained Postman Collection here: [https://github.com/typesense/postman](https://github.com/typesense/postman).\n\n[Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) is an app that let's you perform HTTP requests by pointing and clicking, instead of having to type them out in the terminal.\nThe Postman Collection above gives you template requests that you can import into Postman, to quickly make API calls to Typesense.\n\n## Search UI Components\n\nYou can use our [InstantSearch.js adapter](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-instantsearch-adapter) \nto quickly build powerful search experiences, complete with filtering, sorting, pagination and more.\n\nHere's how: [https://typesense.org/docs/guide/search-ui-components.html](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/search-ui-components.html) \n\n## FAQ\n\n### How does this differ from Elasticsearch?\n\nElasticsearch is a large piece of software, that takes non-trivial amount of effort to setup, administer, scale and fine-tune. \nIt offers you a few thousand configuration parameters to get to your ideal configuration. So it's better suited for large teams \nwho have the bandwidth to get it production-ready, regularly monitor it and scale it, especially when they have a need to store \nbillions of documents and petabytes of data (eg: logs).\n\nTypesense is built specifically for decreasing the \"time to market\" for a delightful search experience. It's a light-weight\nyet powerful & scaleable alternative that focuses on Developer Happiness and Experience with a clean well-documented API, clear semantics \nand smart defaults so it just works well out-of-the-box, without you having to turn many knobs.\n\nElasticsearch also runs on the JVM, which by itself can be quite an effort to tune to run optimally. Typesense, on the other hand, \nis a single light-weight self-contained native binary, so it's simple to setup and operate.\n\nSee a side-by-side feature comparison [here](https://typesense.org/typesense-vs-algolia-vs-elasticsearch-vs-meilisearch/).\n\n### How does this differ from Algolia?\n\nAlgolia is a proprietary, hosted, search-as-a-service product that works well, when cost is not an issue. From our experience,\nfast growing sites and apps quickly run into search & indexing limits, accompanied by expensive plan upgrades as they scale.\n\nTypesense on the other hand is an open-source product that you can run on your own infrastructure or\nuse our managed SaaS offering - [Typesense Cloud](https://cloud.typesense.org). \nThe open source version is free to use (besides of course your own infra costs). \nWith Typesense Cloud we don't charge by records or search operations. Instead, you get a dedicated cluster\nand you can throw as much data and traffic at it as it can handle. You only pay a fixed hourly cost & bandwidth charges \nfor it, depending on the configuration your choose, similar to most modern cloud platforms. \n\nFrom a product perspective, Typesense is closer in spirit to Algolia than Elasticsearch. \nHowever, we've addressed some important limitations with Algolia: \n\nAlgolia requires separate indices for each sort order, which counts towards your plan limits. Most of the index settings like \nfields to search, fields to facet, fields to group by, ranking settings, etc \nare defined upfront when the index is created vs being able to set them on the fly at query time.\n\nWith Typesense, these settings can be configured at search time via query parameters which makes it very flexible\nand unlocks new use cases. Typesense is also able to give you sorted results with a single index, vs having to create multiple.\nThis helps reduce memory consumption.\n\nAlgolia offers the following features that Typesense does not have currently: personalization & server-based search analytics. For analytics, you can still instrument your search on the client-side and send search metrics to your web analytics tool of choice. \n\nWe intend to bridge this gap in Typesense, but in the meantime, please let us know\nif any of these are a show stopper for your use case by creating a feature request in our issue tracker. \n\nSee a side-by-side feature comparison [here](https://typesense.org/typesense-vs-algolia-vs-elasticsearch-vs-meilisearch/).\n\n### Speed is great, but what about the memory footprint?\n\nA fresh Typesense server will consume about 30 MB of memory. As you start indexing documents, the memory use will \nincrease correspondingly. How much it increases depends on the number and type of fields you index. \n\nWe've strived to keep the in-memory data structures lean. To give you a rough idea: when 1 million \nHacker News titles are indexed along with their points, Typesense consumes 165 MB of memory. The same size of that data \non disk in JSON format is 88 MB. If you have any numbers from your own datasets that we can add to this section, please send us a PR!\n\n### Why the GPL license?\n\nFrom our experience companies are generally concerned when **libraries** they use are GPL licensed, since library code is directly integrated into their code and will lead to derivative work and trigger GPL compliance. However, Typesense Server is **server software** and we expect users to typically run it as a separate daemon, and not integrate it with their own code. GPL covers and allows for this use case generously **(eg: Linux is GPL licensed)**. Now, AGPL is what makes server software accessed over a network result in derivative work and not GPL. And for that reason we’ve opted to not use AGPL for Typesense. \n\nNow, if someone makes modifications to Typesense server, GPL actually allows you to still keep the modifications to yourself as long as you don't distribute the modified code. So a company can for example modify Typesense server and run the modified code internally and still not have to open source their modifications, as long as they make the modified code available to everyone who has access to the modified software.\n\nNow, if someone makes modifications to Typesense server and distributes the modifications, that's where GPL kicks in. Given that we’ve published our work to the community, we'd like for others' modifications to also be made open to the community in the spirit of open source. **We use GPL for this purpose.** Other licenses would allow our open source work to be modified, made closed source and distributed, which we want to avoid with Typesense for the project’s long term sustainability.\n\nHere's more background on why GPL, as described by Discourse: https://meta.discourse.org/t/why-gnu-license/2531. Many of the points mentioned there resonate with us.\n\nNow, all of the above only apply to Typesense Server. Our client libraries are indeed meant to be integrated into our users’ code and so they use Apache license.\n\nSo in summary, AGPL is what is usually problematic for server software and we’ve opted not to use it. We believe GPL for Typesense Server captures the essence of what we want for this open source project. GPL has a long history of successfully being used by popular open source projects. Our libraries are still Apache licensed.\n\nIf you have specifics that prevent you from using Typesense due to a licensing issue, we're happy to explore this topic further with you.

Open it and move the app to the application folder.\n\n### Homebrew\nTo install it using Homebrew, open the Terminal app and type:\n```bash\nbrew install stats\n```\n\n### Legacy version\nLegacy version for older systems could be found [here](https://mac-stats.com/downloads).\n\n## Requirements\nStats is supported on the released macOS version starting from macOS 10.15 (Catalina).\n\n## Features\nStats is an application that allows you to monitor your macOS system.\n\n - CPU utilization\n - GPU utilization\n - Memory usage\n - Disk utilization\n - Network usage\n - Battery level\n - Fan's control (not maintained)\n - Sensors information (Temperature/Voltage/Power)\n - Bluetooth devices\n - Multiple time zone clock\n\n## FAQs\n\n### How do you change the order of the menu bar icons?\nmacOS decides the order of the menu bar items not `Stats` - it may change after the first reboot after installing Stats.\n\nTo change the order of any menu bar icon - macOS Mojave (version 10.14) and up.\n\n1. Hold down ⌘ (command key).\n2. Drag the icon to the desired position on the menu bar.\n3. Release ⌘ (command key)\n\n### How to reduce energy impact or CPU usage of Stats?\nStats tries to be efficient as it's possible. But reading some data periodically is not a cheap task. Each module has its own \"price\". So, if you want to reduce energy impact from the Stats you need to disable some Stats modules. The most inefficient modules are Sensors and Bluetooth. Disabling these modules could reduce CPU usage and power efficiency by up to 50% in some cases.\n\n### Fan control\nFan control is in legacy mode. It does not receive any updates or fixes. It's not dropped from the app just because in the old Macs it works pretty acceptable. I'm open to accepting fixed or improvements (via PR) for this feature in case someone would like to help with that. But have no option and time to provide support for this feature.\n\n### Sensors show incorrect CPU/GPU core count\nCPU/GPU sensors are simply thermal zones (sensors) on the CPU/GPU. They have no relation to the number of cores or specific cores.\nFor example, a CPU is typically divided into two clusters: efficiency and performance. Each cluster contains multiple temperature sensors, and Stats simply displays these sensors. However, \"CPU Efficient Core 1\" does not represent the temperature of a single efficient core—it only indicates one of the temperature sensors within the efficiency core cluster.\nAdditionally, with each new SoC, Apple changes the sensor keys. As a result, it takes time to determine which SMC values correspond to the appropriate sensors. If anyone knows how to accurately match the sensors for Apple Silicon, please contact me.\n\n### App crash – what to do?\nFirst, ensure that you are using the latest version of Stats. There is a high chance that a fix preventing the crash has already been released. If you are already running the latest version, check the open issues. Only if none of the existing issues address your problem should you open a new issue.\n\n### Why my issue was closed without any response?\nMost probably because it's a duplicated issue and there is an answer to the question, report, or proposition. Please use a search by closed issues to get an answer.\nSo, if your issue was closed without any response, most probably it already has a response.\n\n### External API\nStats uses some external APIs, such as:\n\n- https://api.mac-stats.com – For update checks and retrieving the public IP address\n- https://api.github.com – Fallback for update checks\n\nBoth of these APIs are used to check for updates. Additionally, an external request is required to obtain the public IP address. I do not want to use any third-party providers for retrieving the public IP address, so I use my own server for this purpose.\n\nIf you have concerns about these requests, you have a few options:\n\n- propose a PR that allows these features to work without an external server\n- block both of these servers using any network filtering app (if you're reading this, you're likely using something like Little Snitch, so you can easily do this). In this case do not expect to receive any updates or see your public IP in the network module.\n\n\n## Supported languages\n- English\n- Polski\n- Українська\n- Русский\n- 中文 (简体) (thanks to [chenguokai](https://github.com/chenguokai), [Tai-Zhou](https://github.com/Tai-Zhou), and [Jerry](https://github.com/Jerry23011))\n- Türkçe (thanks to [yusufozgul](https://github.com/yusufozgul) and [setanarut](https://github.com/setanarut))\n- 한국어 (thanks to [escapeanaemia](https://github.com/escapeanaemia) and [iamhslee](https://github.com/iamhslee))\n- German (thanks to [natterstefan](https://github.com/natterstefan) and [aneitel](https://github.com/aneitel))\n- 中文 (繁體) (thanks to [iamch15542](https://github.com/iamch15542) and [jrthsr700tmax](https://github.com/jrthsr700tmax))\n- Spanish (thanks to [jcconca](https://github.com/jcconca))\n- Vietnamese (thanks to [HXD.VN](https://github.com/xuandung38))\n- French (thanks to [RomainLt](https://github.com/RomainLt))\n- Italian (thanks to [gmcinalli](https://github.com/gmcinalli))\n- Portuguese (Brazil) (thanks to [marcelochaves95](https://github.com/marcelochaves95) and [pedroserigatto](https://github.com/pedroserigatto))\n- Norwegian Bokmål (thanks to [rubjo](https://github.com/rubjo))\n- 日本語 (thanks to [treastrain](https://github.com/treastrain))\n- Portuguese (Portugal) (thanks to [AdamModus](https://github.com/AdamModus))\n- Czech (thanks to [mpl75](https://github.com/mpl75))\n- Magyar (thanks to [moriczr](https://github.com/moriczr))\n- Bulgarian (thanks to [zbrox](https://github.com/zbrox))\n- Romanian (thanks to [razluta](https://github.com/razluta))\n- Dutch (thanks to [ngohungphuc](https://github.com/ngohungphuc))\n- Hrvatski (thanks to [milotype](https://github.com/milotype))\n- Danish (thanks to [casperes1996](https://github.com/casperes1996) and [aleksanderbl29](https://github.com/aleksanderbl29))\n- Catalan (thanks to [davidalonso](https://github.com/davidalonso))\n- Indonesian (thanks to [yooody](https://github.com/yooody))\n- Hebrew (thanks to [BadSugar](https://github.com/BadSugar))\n- Slovenian (thanks to [zigapovhe](https://github.com/zigapovhe))\n- Greek (thanks to [sudoxcess](https://github.com/sudoxcess) and [vaionicle](https://github.com/vaionicle))\n- Persian (thanks to [ShawnAlisson](https://github.com/ShawnAlisson))\n- Slovenský (thanks to [martinbernat](https://github.com/martinbernat))\n- Thai (thanks to [apiphoomchu](https://github.com/apiphoomchu))\n- Estonian (thanks to [postylem](https://github.com/postylem))\n- Hindi (thanks to [patiljignesh](https://github.com/patiljignesh))\n- Finnish (thanks to [eightscrow](https://github.com/eightscrow))\n\nYou can help by adding a new language or improving the existing translation.\n\n## License\n[MIT License](https://github.com/exelban/stats/blob/master/LICENSE)\n",

For the packages installable inside the app, see [termux/termux-packages](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages).\n\nQuick how-to about Termux package management is available at [Package Management](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Package-Management). It also has info on how to fix **`repository is under maintenance or down`** errors when running `apt` or `pkg` commands.\n\n**We are looking for Termux Android application maintainers.**\n\n***\n\n**NOTICE: Termux may be unstable on Android 12+.** Android OS will kill any (phantom) processes greater than 32 (limit is for all apps combined) and also kill any processes using excessive CPU. You may get `[Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter]` message in the terminal without actually exiting the shell process yourself. Check the related issue [#2366](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366), [issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/205156966), [phantom cached and empty processes docs](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/Android-Docs/blob/master/en/docs/apps/processes/phantom-cached-and-empty-processes.md) and [this TLDR comment](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366#issuecomment-1237468220) on how to disable trimming of phantom and excessive cpu usage processes. A proper docs page will be added later. An option to disable the killing should be available in Android 12L or 13, so upgrade at your own risk if you are on Android 11, specially if you are not rooted.\n\n***\n\n## Contents\n- [Termux App and Plugins](#termux-app-and-plugins)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Uninstallation](#uninstallation)\n- [Important Links](#important-links)\n- [Debugging](#debugging)\n- [For Maintainers and Contributors](#for-maintainers-and-contributors)\n- [Forking](#forking)\n- [Sponsors and Funders](#sponsors-and-funders)\n##\n\n\n\n## Termux App and Plugins\n\nThe core [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) app comes with the following optional plugin apps.\n\n- [Termux:API](https://github.com/termux/termux-api)\n- [Termux:Boot](https://github.com/termux/termux-boot)\n- [Termux:Float](https://github.com/termux/termux-float)\n- [Termux:Styling](https://github.com/termux/termux-styling)\n- [Termux:Tasker](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker)\n- [Termux:Widget](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget)\n##\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\nLatest version is `v0.118.3`.\n\n**NOTICE: It is highly recommended that you update to `v0.118.0` or higher ASAP for various bug fixes, including a critical world-readable vulnerability reported [here](https://termux.github.io/general/2022/02/15/termux-apps-vulnerability-disclosures.html). See [below](#google-play-store-experimental-branch) for information regarding Termux on Google Play.**\n\nTermux can be obtained through various sources listed below for **only** Android `>= 7` with full support for apps and packages.\n\nSupport for both app and packages was dropped for Android `5` and `6` on [2020-01-01](https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/dnzdbs/end_of_android56_support_on_20200101/) at `v0.83`, however it was re-added just for the app *without any support for package updates* on [2022-05-24](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/2740) via the [GitHub](#github) sources. Check [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-on-android-5-or-6) for the details.\n\nThe APK files of different sources are signed with different signature keys. The `Termux` app and all its plugins use the same [`sharedUserId`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element) `com.termux` and so all their APKs installed on a device must have been signed with the same signature key to work together and so they must all be installed from the same source. Do not attempt to mix them together, i.e do not try to install an app or plugin from `F-Droid` and another one from a different source like `GitHub`. Android Package Manager will also normally not allow installation of APKs with different signatures and you will get errors on installation like `App not installed`, `Failed to install due to an unknown error`, `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`, `INSTALL_FAILED_SHARED_USER_INCOMPATIBLE`, `signatures do not match previously installed version`, etc. This restriction can be bypassed with root or with custom roms.\n\nIf you wish to install from a different source, then you must **uninstall any and all existing Termux or its plugin app APKs** from your device first, then install all new APKs from the same new source. Check [Uninstallation](#uninstallation) section for details. You may also want to consider [Backing up Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux) before the uninstallation so that you can restore it after re-installing from Termux different source.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, *\"bootstrap\"* refers to the minimal packages that are shipped with the `termux-app` itself to start a working shell environment. Its zips are built and released [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/releases).\n\n### F-Droid\n\nTermux application can be obtained from `F-Droid` from [here](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).\n\nYou **do not** need to download the `F-Droid` app (via the `Download F-Droid` link) to install Termux. You can download the Termux APK directly from the site by clicking the `Download APK` link at the bottom of each version section.\n\nIt usually takes a few days (or even a week or more) for updates to be available on `F-Droid` once an update has been released on `GitHub`. The `F-Droid` releases are built and published by `F-Droid` once they [detect](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/com.termux.yml) a new `GitHub` release. The Termux maintainers **do not** have any control over the building and publishing of the Termux apps on `F-Droid`. Moreover, the Termux maintainers also do not have access to the APK signing keys of `F-Droid` releases, so we cannot release an APK ourselves on `GitHub` that would be compatible with `F-Droid` releases.\n\nThe `F-Droid` app often may not notify you of updates and you will manually have to do a pull down swipe action in the `Updates` tab of the app for it to check updates. Make sure battery optimizations are disabled for the app, check https://dontkillmyapp.com/ for details on how to do that.\n\nOnly a universal APK is released, which will work on all supported architectures. The APK and bootstrap installation size will be `~180MB`. `F-Droid` does [not support](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/1904) architecture specific APKs.\n\n### GitHub\n\nTermux application can be obtained on `GitHub` either from [`GitHub Releases`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases) for version `>= 0.118.0` or from [`GitHub Build Action`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/actions/workflows/debug_build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush) workflows. **For android `>= 7`, only install `apt-android-7` variants. For android `5` and `6`, only install `apt-android-5` variants.**\n\nThe APKs for `GitHub Releases` will be listed under `Assets` drop-down of a release. These are automatically attached when a new version is released.\n\nThe APKs for `GitHub Build` action workflows will be listed under `Artifacts` section of a workflow run. These are created for each commit/push done to the repository and can be used by users who don't want to wait for releases and want to try out the latest features immediately or want to test their pull requests. Note that for action workflows, you need to be [**logged into a `GitHub` account**](https://github.com/login) for the `Artifacts` links to be enabled/clickable. If you are using the [`GitHub` app](https://github.com/mobile), then make sure to open workflow link in a browser like Chrome or Firefox that has your GitHub account logged in since the in-app browser may not be logged in.\n\nThe APKs for both of these are [`debuggable`](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug) and are compatible with each other but they are not compatible with other sources.\n\nBoth universal and architecture specific APKs are released. The APK and bootstrap installation size will be `~180MB` if using universal and `~120MB` if using architecture specific. Check [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2153) for details.\n\n**Security warning**: APK files on GitHub are signed with a test key that has been [shared with community](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks). This IS NOT an official developer key and everyone can use it to generate releases for own testing. Be very careful when using Termux GitHub builds obtained elsewhere except https://github.com/termux/termux-app. Everyone is able to use it to forge a malicious Termux update installable over the GitHub build. Think twice about installing Termux builds distributed via Telegram or other social media. If your device get caught by malware, we will not be able to help you.\n\nThe [test key](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks) shall not be used to impersonate @termux and can't be used for this anyway. This key is not trusted by us and it is quite easy to detect its use in user generated content.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Keystore information</summary>\n\n```\nAlias name: alias\nCreation date: Oct 4, 2019\nEntry type: PrivateKeyEntry\nCertificate chain length: 1\nCertificate[1]:\nOwner: CN=APK Signer, OU=Earth, O=Earth\nIssuer: CN=APK Signer, OU=Earth, O=Earth\nSerial number: 29be297b\nValid from: Wed Sep 04 02:03:24 EEST 2019 until: Tue Oct 26 02:03:24 EEST 2049\nCertificate fingerprints:\n         SHA1: 51:79:55:EA:BF:69:FC:05:7C:41:C7:D3:79:DB:BC:EF:20:AD:85:F2\n         SHA256: B6:DA:01:48:0E:EF:D5:FB:F2:CD:37:71:B8:D1:02:1E:C7:91:30:4B:DD:6C:4B:F4:1D:3F:AA:BA:D4:8E:E5:E1\nSignature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA (disabled)\nSubject Public Key Algorithm: 2048-bit RSA key\nVersion: 3\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Google Play Store **(Experimental branch)**\n\nThere is currently a build of Termux available on Google Play for Android 11+ devices, with extensive adjustments in order to pass policy requirements there. This is under development and has missing functionality and bugs (see [here](https://github.com/termux-play-store/) for status updates) compared to the stable F-Droid build, which is why most users who can should still use F-Droid or GitHub build as mentioned above.\n\nCurrently, Google Play will try to update installations away from F-Droid ones. Updating will still fail as [sharedUserId](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element#uid) has been removed. A planned 0.118.1 F-Droid release will fix this by setting a higher version code than used for the PlayStore app. Meanwhile, to prevent Google Play from attempting to download and then fail to install the Google Play releases over existing installations, you can open the Termux apps pages on Google Play and then click on the 3 dots options button in the top right and then disable the Enable auto update toggle. However, the Termux apps updates will still show in the PlayStore app updates list.\n\nIf you want to help out with testing the Google Play build (or cannot install Termux from other sources), be aware that it's built from a separate repository (https://github.com/termux-play-store/) - be sure to report issues [there](https://github.com/termux-play-store/termux-issues/issues/new/choose), as any issues encountered might very well be specific to that repository.\n\n## Uninstallation\n\nUninstallation may be required if a user doesn't want Termux installed in their device anymore or is switching to a different [install source](#installation). You may also want to consider [Backing up Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux) before the uninstallation.\n\nTo uninstall Termux completely, you must uninstall **any and all existing Termux or its plugin app APKs** listed in [Termux App and Plugins](#termux-app-and-plugins).\n\nGo to `Android Settings` -> `Applications` and then look for those apps. You can also use the search feature if it’s available on your device and search `termux` in the applications list.\n\nEven if you think you have not installed any of the plugins, it's strongly suggested to go through the application list in Android settings and double-check.\n##\n\n\n\n## Important Links\n\n### Community\nAll community links are available [here](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Community).\n\nThe main ones are the following.\n\n- [Termux Reddit community](https://reddit.com/r/termux)\n- [Termux User Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#termux_termux:gitter.im) ([Gitter](https://gitter.im/termux/termux))\n- [Termux Dev Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#termux_dev:gitter.im) ([Gitter](https://gitter.im/termux/dev))\n- [Termux X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/termuxdevs)\n- [Termux Support Email](mailto:support@termux.dev)\n\n### Wikis\n\n- [Termux Wiki](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/)\n- [Termux App Wiki](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki)\n- [Termux Packages Wiki](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- [FAQ](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/FAQ)\n- [Termux File System Layout](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-file-system-layout)\n- [Differences From Linux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux)\n- [Package Management](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Package_Management)\n- [Remote Access](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access)\n- [Backing up Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux)\n- [Terminal Settings](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Terminal_Settings)\n- [Touch Keyboard](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard)\n- [Android Storage and Sharing Data with Other Apps](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Internal_and_external_storage)\n- [Android APIs](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API)\n- [Moved Termux Packages Hosting From Bintray to IPFS](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/6348)\n- [Running Commands in Termux From Other Apps via `RUN_COMMAND` intent](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent)\n- [Termux and Android 10](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-and-Android-10)\n\n\n### Terminal\n\n<details>\n<summary></summary>\n\n### Terminal resources\n\n- [XTerm control sequences](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html)\n- [vt100.net](https://vt100.net/)\n- [Terminal codes (ANSI and terminfo equivalents)](https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes)\n\n### Terminal emulators\n\n- VTE (libvte): Terminal emulator widget for GTK+, mainly used in gnome-terminal.

The `Log Level` defaults to `Normal` and log level `Verbose` currently logs additional information. Its best to revert log level to `Normal` after you have finished debugging since private data may otherwise be passed to `logcat` during normal operation and moreover, additional logging increases execution time.\n\nThe plugin apps **do not execute the commands themselves** but send execution intents to `Termux` app, which has its own log level which can be set in `Termux` app settings -> `Termux` -> `Debugging` -> `Log Level`. So you must set log level for both `Termux` and the respective plugin app settings to get all the info.\n\nOnce log levels have been set, you can run the `logcat` command in `Termux` app terminal to view the logs in realtime (`Ctrl+c` to stop) or use `logcat -d > logcat.txt` to take a dump of the log. You can also view the logs from a PC over `ADB`. For more information, check official android `logcat` guide [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat).\n\nMoreover, users can generate termux files `stat` info and `logcat` dump automatically too with terminal's long hold options menu `More` -> `Report Issue` option and selecting `YES` in the prompt shown to add debug info. This can be helpful for reporting and debugging other issues. If the report generated is too large, then `Save To File` option in context menu (3 dots on top right) of `ReportActivity` can be used and the file viewed/shared instead.\n\nUsers must post complete report (optionally without sensitive info) when reporting issues. Issues opened with **(partial) screenshots of error reports** instead of text will likely be automatically closed/deleted.\n\n##### Log Levels\n\n- `Off` - Log nothing.\n- `Normal` - Start logging error, warn and info messages and stacktraces.\n- `Debug` - Start logging debug messages.\n- `Verbose` - Start logging verbose messages.\n##\n\n\n\n## For Maintainers and Contributors\n\nThe [termux-shared](termux-shared) library was added in [`v0.109`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.109). It defines shared constants and utils of the Termux app and its plugins. It was created to allow for the removal of all hardcoded paths in the Termux app. Some of the termux plugins are using this as well and rest will in future. If you are contributing code that is using a constant or a util that may be shared, then define it in `termux-shared` library if it currently doesn't exist and reference it from there. Update the relevant changelogs as well. Pull requests using hardcoded values **will/should not** be accepted. Termux app and plugin specific classes must be added under `com.termux.shared.termux` package and general classes outside it. The [`termux-shared` `LICENSE`](termux-shared/LICENSE.md) must also be checked and updated if necessary when contributing code. The licenses of any external library or code must be honoured.\n\nThe main Termux constants are defined by [`TermuxConstants`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java) class. It also contains information on how to fork Termux or build it with your own package name. Changing the package name will require building the bootstrap zip packages and other packages with the new `$PREFIX`, check [Building Packages](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Building-packages) for more info.\n\nCheck [Termux Libraries](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries) for how to import termux libraries in plugin apps and [Forking and Local Development](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries#forking-and-local-development) for how to update termux libraries for plugins.\n\nThe `versionName` in `build.gradle` files of Termux and its plugin apps must follow the [semantic version `2.0.0` spec](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) in the format `major.minor.patch(-prerelease)(+buildmetadata)`. When bumping `versionName` in `build.gradle` files and when creating a tag for new releases on GitHub, make sure to include the patch number as well, like `v0.1.0` instead of just `v0.1`. The `build.gradle` files and `attach_debug_apks_to_release` workflow validates the version as well and the build/attachment will fail if `versionName` does not follow the spec.\n\n### Commit Messages Guidelines\n\nCommit messages **must** use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) spec so that chagelogs as per the [Keep a Changelog](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog) spec can automatically be generated by the [`create-conventional-changelog`](https://github.com/termux/create-conventional-changelog) script, check its repo for further details on the spec. **The first letter for `type` and `description` must be capital and description should be in the present tense.** The space after the colon `:` is necessary. For a breaking change, add an exclamation mark `!` before the colon `:`, so that it is highlighted in the chagelog automatically.\n\n```\n<type>[optional scope]: <description>\n\n[optional body]\n\n[optional footer(s)]\n```\n\n**Only the `types` listed below must be used exactly as they are used in the changelog headings.** For example, `Added: Add foo`, `Added|Fixed: Add foo and fix bar`, `Changed!: Change baz as a breaking change`, etc. You can optionally add a scope as well, like `Fixed(terminal): Fix some bug`. **Do not use anything else as type, like `add` instead of `Added`, etc.**\n\n- **Added** for new features.\n- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.\n- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features.\n- **Removed** for now removed features.\n- **Fixed** for any bug fixes.\n- **Security** in case of vulnerabilities.\n##\n\n\n\n## Forking\n\n- Check [`TermuxConstants`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java) javadocs for instructions on what changes to make in the app to change package name.\n- You also need to recompile bootstrap zip for the new package name. Check [building bootstrap](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/For-maintainers#build-bootstrap-archives), [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/1983) and [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2081#issuecomment-865280111).\n- Currently, not all plugins use `TermuxConstants` from `termux-shared` library and have hardcoded `com.termux` values and will need to be manually patched.\n- If forking termux plugins, check [Forking and Local Development](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries#forking-and-local-development) for info on how to use termux libraries for plugins.\n##\n\n\n\n## Sponsors and Funders\n\n[<img alt=\"GitHub Accelerator\" width=\"25%\" src=\"site/assets/sponsors/github.png\" />](https://github.com)  \n*[GitHub Accelerator](https://github.com/accelerator) ([1](https://github.blog/2023-04-12-github-accelerator-our-first-cohort-and-whats-next))*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[<img alt=\"GitHub Secure Open Source Fund\" width=\"25%\" src=\"site/assets/sponsors/github.png\" />](https://github.com)  \n*[GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://resources.github.com/github-secure-open-source-fund) ([1](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/securing-the-supply-chain-at-scale-starting-with-71-important-open-source-projects), [2](https://termux.dev/en/posts/general/2025/08/11/termux-selected-for-github-secure-open-source-fund-session-2.html))*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[<img alt=\"NLnet NGI Mobifree\" width=\"25%\" src=\"site/assets/sponsors/nlnet-ngi-mobifree.png\" />](https://nlnet.nl/mobifree)  \n*[NLnet NGI Mobifree](https://nlnet.nl/mobifree) ([1](https://nlnet.nl/news/2024/20241111-NGI-Mobifree-grants.html), [2](https://termux.dev/en/posts/general/2024/11/11/termux-selected-for-nlnet-ngi-mobifree-grant.html))*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[<img alt=\"Cloudflare\" width=\"25%\" src=\"site/assets/sponsors/cloudflare.png\" />](https://www.cloudflare.com)  \n*[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) ([1](https://packages-cf.termux.dev))*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[<img alt=\"Warp\" width=\"25%\" src=\"https://github.com/warpdotdev/brand-assets/blob/640dffd347439bbcb535321ab36b7281cf4446c0/Github/Sponsor/Warp-Github-LG-03.png\" />](https://www.warp.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=termux)  \n[*Warp, built for coding with multiple AI agents*](https://www.warp.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=termux)\n",

      "readme": "# Domain list community\n\nThis project manages a list of domains, to be used as geosites for routing purpose in Project V.\n\n## Purpose of this project\n\nThis project is not opinionated. In other words, it does NOT endorse, claim or imply that a domain should be blocked or proxied. It can be used to generate routing rules on demand.\n\n## Download links\n\n- **dlc.dat**：[https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat)\n- **dlc.dat.sha256sum**：[https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat.sha256sum](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/releases/latest/download/dlc.dat.sha256sum)\n\n## Usage example\n\nEach file in the `data` directory can be used as a rule in this format: `geosite:filename`.\n\n```json\n\"routing\": {\n  \"domainStrategy\": \"IPIfNonMatch\",\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"field\",\n      \"outboundTag\": \"Reject\",\n      \"domain\": [\n        \"geosite:category-ads-all\",\n        \"geosite:category-porn\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"field\",\n      \"outboundTag\": \"Direct\",\n      \"domain\": [\n        \"domain:icloud.com\",\n        \"domain:icloud-content.com\",\n        \"domain:cdn-apple.com\",\n        \"geosite:cn\",\n        \"geosite:private\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"field\",\n      \"outboundTag\": \"Proxy-1\",\n      \"domain\": [\n        \"geosite:category-anticensorship\",\n        \"geosite:category-media\",\n        \"geosite:category-vpnservices\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"field\",\n      \"outboundTag\": \"Proxy-2\",\n      \"domain\": [\n        \"geosite:category-dev\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"field\",\n      \"outboundTag\": \"Proxy-3\",\n      \"domain\": [\n        \"geosite:geolocation-!cn\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Generate `dlc.dat` manually\n\n- Install `golang` and `git`\n- Clone project code: `git clone https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community.git`\n- Navigate to project root directory: `cd domain-list-community`\n- Install project dependencies: `go mod download`\n- Generate `dlc.dat` (without `datapath` option means to use domain lists in `data` directory of current working directory):\n  - `go run ./`\n  - `go run ./ --datapath=/path/to/your/custom/data/directory`\n\nRun `go run ./ --help` for more usage information.\n\n## Structure of data\n\nAll data are under `data` directory. Each file in the directory represents a sub-list of domains, named by the file name. File content is in the following format.\n\n```\n# comments\ninclude:another-file\ndomain:google.com @attr1 @attr2\nkeyword:google\nregexp:www\\.google\\.com$\nfull:www.google.com\n```\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n> The following types of rules are **NOT** fully compatible with the ones that defined by user in V2Ray config file. Do **Not** copy and paste directly.\n\n- Comment begins with `#`. It may begin anywhere in the file. The content in the line after `#` is treated as comment and ignored in production.\n- Inclusion begins with `include:`, followed by the file name of an existing file in the same directory.\n- Subdomain begins with `domain:`, followed by a valid domain name. The prefix `domain:` may be omitted.\n- Keyword begins with `keyword:`, followed by a string.\n- Regular expression begins with `regexp:`, followed by a valid regular expression (per Golang's standard).\n- Full domain begins with `full:`, followed by a complete and valid domain name.\n- Domains (including `domain`, `keyword`, `regexp` and `full`) may have one or more attributes. Each attribute begins with `@` and followed by the name of the attribute.\n\n> **Note:** Adding new `regexp` and `keyword` rules is discouraged because it is easy to use them incorrectly, and proxy software cannot efficiently match these types of rules.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe entire `data` directory will be built into an external `geosite` file for Project V. Each file in the directory represents a section in the generated file.\n\nTo generate a section:\n\n1. Remove all the comments in the file.\n2. Replace `include:` lines with the actual content of the file.\n3. Omit all empty lines.\n4. Generate each `domain:` line into a [sub-domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/routercommon/common.proto#L21).\n5. Generate each `full:` line into a [full domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/routercommon/common.proto#L23).\n6. Generate each `keyword:` line into a [plain domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/routercommon/common.proto#L17).\n7. Generate each `regexp:` line into a [regex domain routing rule](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core/blob/master/app/router/routercommon/common.proto#L19).\n\n## How to organize domains\n\n### File name\n\nTheoretically any string can be used as the name, as long as it is a valid file name. In practice, we prefer names for determinic group of domains, such as the owner (usually a company name) of the domains, e.g., \"google\", \"netflix\". Names with unclear scope are generally unrecommended, such as \"evil\", or \"local\".\n\n### Attributes\n\nAttribute is useful for sub-group of domains, especially for filtering purpose. For example, the list of `google` domains may contains its main domains, as well as domains that serve ads. The ads domains may be marked by attribute `@ads`, and can be used as `geosite:google@ads` in V2Ray routing.\n\n## Contribution guideline\n\n- Fork this repo, make modifications to your own repo, file a PR.\n- Please begin with small size PRs, say modification in a single file.\n- A PR must be reviewed and approved by another member.\n- A script will verify your pull request to test whether your PR is correct or not every time you update the PR.

Clear **insights at a glance**, no complexity.\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>All heroes have a great origin story. Click to discover ours.</strong></summary>\n  <br/>\n\nIn 2013, at the company where Costa Tsaousis was COO, a significant percentage of their cloud-based transactions failed silently, severely impacting business performance.\n\nCosta and his team tried every troubleshooting tool available at the time. None could identify the root cause. As Costa later wrote:\n\n“*I couldn’t believe that monitoring systems provide so few metrics and with such low resolution, scale so badly, and cost so much to run.*”\n\nFrustrated, he decided to build his own monitoring tool, starting from scratch.\n\nThat decision led to countless late nights and weekends. It also sparked a fundamental shift in how infrastructure monitoring and troubleshooting are approached, both in method and in cost.\n</details>\n\n### Most Energy-Efficient Monitoring Tool\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://www.ivanomalavolta.com/files/papers/ICSOC_2023.pdf#gh-dark-mode-only\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/netdata/netdata/assets/139226121/7118757a-38fb-48d7-b12a-53e709a8e8c0\" alt=\"Energy Efficiency\" width=\"800\"/>\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.ivanomalavolta.com/files/papers/ICSOC_2023.pdf#gh-light-mode-only\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/netdata/netdata/assets/139226121/4f64cbb6-05e4-48e3-b7c0-d1b79e37e219\" alt=\"Energy efficiency\" width=\"800\"/>\n</a>\n</p>\n\nAccording to the [University of Amsterdam study](https://www.ivanomalavolta.com/files/papers/ICSOC_2023.pdf), Netdata is the most energy-efficient tool for monitoring Docker-based systems. The study also shows Netdata excels in CPU usage, RAM usage, and execution time compared to other monitoring solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Key Features\n\n| Feature                    | Description                               | What Makes It Unique                                     |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Real-Time**              | Per-second data collection and processing | Works in a beat – click and see results instantly        |\n| **Zero-Configuration**     | Automatic detection and discovery         | Auto-discovers everything on the nodes it runs           |\n| **ML-Powered**             | Unsupervised anomaly detection            | Trains multiple ML models per metric at the edge         |\n| **Long-Term Retention**    | High-performance storage                  | ~0.5 bytes per sample with tiered storage for archiving  |\n| **Advanced Visualization** | Rich, interactive dashboards              | Slice and dice data without query language               |\n| **Extreme Scalability**    | Native horizontal scaling                 | Parent-Child centralization with multi-million samples/s |\n| **Complete Visibility**    | From infrastructure to applications       | Simplifies operations and eliminates silos               |\n| **Edge-Based**             | Processing at your premises               | Distributes code instead of centralizing data            |\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Want to put Netdata to the test against Prometheus?\n> Explore the [full comparison](https://www.netdata.cloud/blog/netdata-vs-prometheus-2025/).\n\n---\n\n## Netdata Ecosystem\n\nThis three-part architecture enables you to scale from single nodes to complex multi-cloud environments:\n\n| Component         | Description                                                                                                                                                 | License                                         |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Netdata Agent** | • Core monitoring engine<br>• Handles collection, storage, ML, alerts, exports<br>• Runs on servers, cloud, K8s, IoT<br>• Zero production impact            | [GPL v3+](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0) |\n| **Netdata Cloud** | • Enterprise features<br>• User management, RBAC, horizontal scaling<br>• Centralized alerts<br>• Free community tier<br>• No metric storage centralization |                                                 |\n| **Netdata UI**    | • Dashboards and visualizations<br>• Free to use<br>• Included in standard packages<br>• Latest version via CDN                                             | [NCUL1](https://app.netdata.cloud/LICENSE.txt)  |\n\n## What You Can Monitor\n\nWith Netdata you can monitor all these components across platforms:\n\n|                                                                                                   Component |              Linux               | FreeBSD | macOS |                      Windows                      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:-------:|:-----:|:-------------------------------------------------:|\n|                             **System Resources**<small><br/>CPU, Memory and system shared resources</small> |               Full               |   Yes   |  Yes  |                        Yes                        |\n|                                **Storage**<small><br/>Disks, Mount points, Filesystems, RAID arrays</small> |               Full               |   Yes   |  Yes  |                        Yes                        |\n|                                 **Network**<small><br/>Network Interfaces, Protocols, Firewall, etc</small> |               Full               |   Yes   |  Yes  |                        Yes                        |\n|                        **Hardware & Sensors**<small><br/>Fans, Temperatures, Controllers, GPUs, etc</small> |               Full               |  Some   | Some  |                       Some                        |\n|                                       **O/S Services**<small><br/>Resources, Performance and Status</small> | Yes<small><br/>`systemd`</small> |    -

systems, containers, apps, logs, APIs, and synthetic checks.\n2. **Store** – Save metrics to a high-efficiency, tiered time-series database.\n3. **Learn** – Train ML models per metric using recent behavior.\n4. **Detect** – Identify anomalies using trained ML models.\n5. **Check** – Evaluate metrics against pre-set or custom alert rules.\n6. **Stream** – Send metrics to Netdata Parents in real time.\n7. **Archive** – Export metrics to Prometheus, InfluxDB, OpenTSDB, Graphite, and others.\n8. **Query** – Access metrics via an API for dashboards or third-party tools.\n9. **Score** – Use a scoring engine to find patterns and correlations across metrics.\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Learn more: [Netdata's

Legal Information](#v-legal-information)\n\n[VI. Further Information](#vi-further-information)\n\n# I. Windows\n\n## Requirements for Building VeraCrypt for Windows:\n\nA detailed guide on how to build VeraCrypt on Windows can be found in\nthe [documentation](./doc/html/CompilingGuidelineWin.html) in the repository and\nit is also available [online](https://veracrypt.jp/en/CompilingGuidelineWin.html) or on the [mirror](https://veracrypt.io/en/CompilingGuidelineWin.html).\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nThe 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, and in\nsome cases (e.g. playback of HD DVD content) also the 32-bit editions do not\nallow the VeraCrypt driver to run without an appropriate digital signature.\nTherefore, all .sys files in official VeraCrypt binary packages are digitally\nsigned with the digital certificate of the IDRIX, which was issued by\nGlobalSign certification authority. At the end of each official .exe and\n.sys file, there are embedded digital signatures and all related certificates\n(i.e. all certificates in the relevant certification chain, such as the\ncertification authority certificates, CA-MS cross-certificate, and the\nIDRIX certificate).\n\nKeep this in mind if you compile VeraCrypt and compare your binaries with the\nofficial binaries. If your binaries are unsigned, the sizes of the official\nbinaries will usually be approximately 10 KiB greater than the sizes of your\nbinaries (there may be further differences if you use a different version of\nthe compiler, or if you install a different or no service pack for Visual\nStudio, or different hotfixes for it, or if you use different versions of\nthe required SDKs).\n\n## Instructions for Signing and Packaging VeraCrypt for Windows:\n\nFirst, create an environment variable 'WSDK81' pointing to the Windows SDK\nfor Windows 8.1 installation directory.\n\nThe folder \"Signing\" contains a batch file (sign.bat) that will sign all\nVeraCrypt components using a code signing certificate present on the\ncertificate store and build the final installation setup and MSI package.\nThe batch file assumes that the code signing certificate is issued by\nGlobalSign. This is the case for IDRIX's certificate. If yours is issued by\nanother CA, then you should put its intermediate certificates in the \"Signing\"\nfolder and modify sign.bat accordingly.\n\nTo generate MSI packages, WiX Toolset v3.11 must be installed.\n\n## VeraCrypt EFI Boot Loader:\n\nVeraCrypt source code contains pre-built EFI binaries under src\\Boot\\EFI.\nThe source code of VeraCrypt EFI Boot Loader is licensed under LGPL and\nit is available at https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt-DCS.\nFor build instructions, please refer to the file src\\Boot\\EFI\\Readme.txt.\n\n# II. Linux and Mac OS X\n\nA detailed guide on how to build VeraCrypt on Linux can be found in\nthe [documentation](./doc/html/CompilingGuidelineLinux.html) in the repository and\nit is also available [online](https://veracrypt.jp/en/CompilingGuidelineLinux.html) or on the [mirror](https://veracrypt.io/en/CompilingGuidelineLinux.html).\n\n## Requirements for Building VeraCrypt for Linux and Mac OS X:\n\n- GNU Make\n- GNU C++ Compiler 4.0 or compatible\n- Apple Xcode or Xcode command line tools (Mac OS X only)\n- YASM 1.3.0 or newer (Linux only, x86/x64 architecture only)\n- pkg-config\n- wxWidgets 3.0 shared library and header files installed or\n  wxWidgets 3.0 library source code (available at https://www.wxwidgets.org)\n- FUSE library and header files (available at https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse\n  and https://macfuse.github.io/)\n- PCSC-lite library and header files (available at https://github.com/LudovicRousseau/PCSC)\n\n## Instructions for Building VeraCrypt for Linux and Mac OS X:\n\n1. Change the current directory to the root of the VeraCrypt source code.\n\n2. If you have no wxWidgets shared library installed, run the following\n   command to configure the wxWidgets static library for VeraCrypt and to\n   build it:\n\n   `$ make WXSTATIC=1 WX_ROOT=/usr/src/wxWidgets wxbuild`\n\n   The variable `WX_ROOT` must point to the location of the source code of the\n   wxWidgets library. Output files will be placed in the './wxrelease/'\n   directory.\n\n3. To build VeraCrypt, run the following command:\n\n   `$ make`\n\n   or if you have no wxWidgets shared library installed:\n\n   `$ make WXSTATIC=1`\n\n4. If successful, the VeraCrypt executable should be located in the directory\n   'Main'.\n\nBy default, a universal executable supporting both graphical and text user\ninterface (through the switch --text) is built.\nOn Linux, a console-only executable, which requires no GUI library, can be\nbuilt using the 'NOGUI' parameter:\n\n`$ make NOGUI=1 WXSTATIC=1 WX_ROOT=/usr/src/wxWidgets wxbuild`\n\n`$ make NOGUI=1 WXSTATIC=1`\n\nOn MacOSX, building a console-only executable is not supported.\n\n## Mac OS X specifics:\n\nUnder MacOSX, the latest installed SDK is used by default. To use a different version\nof the SDK when building using make, you can export the environment variable VC_OSX_SDK:\n\n`$ export VC_OSX_SDK=13.0`\n\nFor development dependencies management, you can use [homebrew](https://brew.sh).\n\n`$ brew install pkg-config yasm wxwidgets`\n\nYou also need system dependencies\n\n`$ brew install --cask macfuse packages`\n\nAfter installing dependencies via brew, you can build a local development build\n\n`$ ./src/Build/build_veracrypt_macosx.sh -b`\n\nIf you want to build the package, you must pass `-p` to the build script above. The built\nexecutable will be in `.src/Main`\n\nIf you prefer to build from sources, or without homebrew, pkg-config and packages must be installed.\n\nGet pkg-config from https://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.29.2.tar.gz and\ncompile using the following commands:\n\n`$ CFLAGS=\"-Wno-int-conversion\" CXXFLAGS=\"-Wno-int-conversion\" ./configure --with-internal-glib`\n\n`$ make`\n\n`$ sudo make install`\n\nAfter making sure pkg-config is available, download and install macFUSE from\nhttps://macfuse.github.io/\n\nThe [build_veracrypt_macosx.sh](./src/Build/build_veracrypt_macosx.sh) script performs the\nfull build of VeraCrypt including the creation of the installer pkg. It expects\nto find the wxWidgets 3.2.5 sources at the same level as where you put\nVeraCrypt sources (i.e. if \"src\" path is \"/Users/joe/Projects/VeraCrypt/src\"\nthen wxWidgets should be at \"/Users/joe/Projects/wxWidgets-3.2.5\")\n\nThe make build process uses Code Signing certificates whose ID is specified in\nsrc/Main/Main.make (look for lines containing \"Developer ID Application\" and\n\"Developer ID Installer\"). You'll have to modify these lines to put the ID of\nyour Code Signing certificates or comment them out if you don't have one.\n\nBecause of incompatibility issues with macFUSE, the SDK 10.9 generates a\nVeraCrypt binary that has issues communicating with the macFUSE kernel extension.\nThus, we recommend using a different macOS SDK version for building VeraCrypt.\n\nThe Packages installer that is used for the VeraCrypt official build has been notarized by IDRIX and it is available at\nhttps://github.com/idrassi/packages/releases\n\n# III. FreeBSD\n\nFreeBSD is supported starting from version 11.\nThe build requirements and instructions are the same as Linux except that gmake\nshould be used instead of make.\n\n# IV. Third-Party Developers (Contributors)\n\nIf you intend to implement a feature, please contact us first to make sure:\n\n1. That the feature has not been implemented (we may have already implemented\n   it, but haven't released the code yet).\n2. That the feature is acceptable.\n3.

Because it's written in C, it can be made available to any\nother programming language through \"bindings\", so you can use it in\n[Ruby](https://github.com/libgit2/rugged),\n[.NET](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp),\n[Python](http://www.pygit2.org/),\n[Node.js](http://nodegit.org),\n[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs), and more.\n\n`libgit2` is licensed under a **very permissive license** (GPLv2 with\na special Linking Exception). This means that you can link against\nthe library with any kind of software without making that software\nfall under the GPL.

If you're _not_ using C,\nand you're writing in a different language or platform like .NET,\nNode.js, or Ruby, then there is probably a\n\"[language binding](#language-bindings)\" that you can use to take care\nof the messy tasks of calling into native code.\n\nBut if you _do_ want to use libgit2 directly - because you're building\nan application in C - then you may be able use an existing binary.\nThere are packages for the\n[vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) and\n[conan](https://conan.io/center/recipes/libgit2)\npackage managers.  And libgit2 is available in \n[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libgit2) and most Linux\ndistributions.\n\nHowever, these versions _may_ be outdated and we recommend using the\nlatest version if possible.  Thankfully libgit2 is not hard to compile.\n\nQuick Start\n===========\n\n**Prerequisites** for building libgit2:\n\n1. [CMake](https://cmake.org/), and is recommended to be installed into\n   your `PATH`.\n2. [Python](https://www.python.org) is used by our test framework, and\n   should be installed into your `PATH`.\n3. C compiler: libgit2 is C90 and should compile on most compilers.\n   * Windows: Visual Studio is recommended\n   * Mac: Xcode is recommended\n   * Unix: gcc or clang is recommended.\n\n**Build**\n\n1. Create a build directory beneath the libgit2 source directory,\n   and change into it: `mkdir build && cd build`\n2. Create the cmake build environment: `cmake ..`\n3. Build libgit2: `cmake --build .`\n\nTrouble with these steps?  Read our [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).\nMore detailed build guidance is available below.\n\nGetting Help\n============\n\n**Chat with us**\n\n- via IRC: join [#libgit2](https://web.libera.chat/#libgit2) on\n  [libera](https://libera.chat).\n- via Slack: visit [slack.libgit2.org](http://slack.libgit2.org/)\n  to sign up, then join us in `#libgit2`\n\n**Getting Help**\n\nIf you have questions about the library, please be sure to check out the\n[API documentation](https://libgit2.org/libgit2/).  If you still have\nquestions, reach out to us on Slack or post a question on \n[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/libgit2)\n(with the `libgit2` tag).\n\n**Reporting Bugs**\n\nPlease open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/issues)\nand include as much information as possible.  If possible, provide\nsample code that illustrates the problem you're seeing.  If you're\nseeing a bug only on a specific repository, please provide a link to\nit if possible.\n\nWe ask that you not open a GitHub Issue for help, only for bug reports.\n\n**Reporting Security Issues**\n\nPlease have a look at SECURITY.md.\n\nWhat It Can Do\n==============\n\nlibgit2 provides you with the ability to manage Git repositories in the\nprogramming language of your choice.  It's used in production to power many\napplications including GitHub.com, Plastic SCM and Azure DevOps.\n\nIt does not aim to replace the git tool or its user-facing commands. Some\nAPIs resemble the plumbing commands as those align closely with the\nconcepts of the Git system, but most commands a user would type are out\nof scope for this library to implement directly.\n\nThe library provides:\n\n* SHA conversions, formatting and shortening\n* abstracted ODB backend system\n* commit, tag, tree and blob parsing, editing, and write-back\n* tree traversal\n* revision walking\n* index file (staging area) manipulation\n* reference management (including packed references)\n* config file management\n* high level repository management\n* thread safety and reentrancy\n* descriptive and detailed error messages\n* ...and more (over 175 different API calls)\n\nAs libgit2 is purely a consumer of the Git system, we have to\nadjust to changes made upstream. This has two major consequences:\n\n* Some changes may require us to change provided interfaces. While\n  we try to implement functions in a generic way so that no future\n  changes are required, we cannot promise a completely stable API.\n* As we have to keep up with changes in behavior made upstream, we\n  may lag behind in some areas. We usually to document these\n  incompatibilities in our issue tracker with the label \"git change\".\n\nOptional dependencies\n=====================\n\nWhile the library provides git functionality with very few\ndependencies, some recommended dependencies are used for performance\nor complete functionality.\n\n- Hash generation: Git uses SHA1DC (collision detecting SHA1) for\n  its default hash generation. SHA256 support is experimental, and\n  optimized support is provided by system libraries on macOS and\n  Windows, or by the HTTPS library on Unix systems when available.\n- Threading: is provided by the system libraries on Windows, and\n  pthreads on Unix systems.\n- HTTPS: is provided by the system libraries on macOS and Windows,\n  or by OpenSSL or mbedTLS on other Unix systems.\n- SSH: is provided by [libssh2](https://libssh2.org/) or by invoking\n  [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com).\n- Unicode: is provided by the system libraries on Windows and macOS.\n\nInitialization\n===============\n\nThe library needs to keep track of some global state. Call\n\n    git_libgit2_init();\n\nbefore calling any other libgit2 functions. You can call this function many times. A matching number of calls to\n\n    git_libgit2_shutdown();\n\nwill free the resources.  Note that if you have worker threads, you should\ncall `git_libgit2_shutdown` *after* those threads have exited.  If you\nrequire assistance coordinating this, simply have the worker threads call\n`git_libgit2_init` at startup and `git_libgit2_shutdown` at shutdown.\n\nThreading\n=========\n\nSee [threading](docs/threading.md) for information\n\nConventions\n===========\n\nSee [conventions](docs/conventions.md) for an overview of the external\nand internal API/coding conventions we use.\n\nBuilding libgit2 - Using CMake\n==============================\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\n`libgit2` builds cleanly on most platforms without any external\ndependencies as a requirement. `libgit2` is built using\n[CMake](<https://cmake.org/>) (version 2.8 or newer) on all platforms.\n\nOn most systems you can build the library using the following commands\n\n\t$ mkdir build && cd build\n\t$ cmake ..\n\t$ cmake --build .\n\nTo include the examples in the build, use `cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..`\ninstead of `cmake ..`. The built executable for the examples can then\nbe found in `build/examples`, relative to the toplevel directory.\n\nAlternatively you can point the CMake GUI tool to the CMakeLists.txt file and generate platform specific build project or IDE workspace.\n\nIf you're not familiar with CMake, [a more detailed explanation](https://preshing.com/20170511/how-to-build-a-cmake-based-project/) may be helpful.\n\nAdvanced Options\n----------------\n\nYou can specify a number of options to `cmake` that will change the\nway `libgit2` is built. To use this, specify `-Doption=value` during\nthe initial `cmake` configuration. For example, to enable SHA256\ncompatibility:\n\n\t$ mkdir build && cd build\n\t$ cmake -DEXPERIMENTAL_SHA256=ON ..\n\t$ cmake --build .\n\nlibgit2 options:\n\n* `EXPERIMENTAL_SHA256=ON`: turns on SHA256 compatibility; note that\n  this is an API-incompatible change, hence why it is labeled\n  \"experimental\"\n\nBuild options:\n\n* `BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`: builds the suite of example code\n* `BUILD_FUZZERS=ON`: builds the fuzzing suite\n* `ENABLE_WERROR=ON`: build with `-Werror` or the equivalent, which turns\n  compiler warnings into errors in the libgit2 codebase (but not its\n  dependencies)\n\nDependency options:\n\n* `USE_SSH=type`: enables SSH support and optionally selects the provider;\n  `type` can be set to `libssh2` or `exec` (which will execute an external\n  OpenSSH command). `ON` implies `libssh2`; defaults to `OFF`.\n* `USE_HTTPS=type`: enables HTTPS support and optionally selects the\n  provider; `type` can be set to `OpenSSL`, `OpenSSL-Dynamic` (to not\n  link against OpenSSL, but load it dynamically), `SecureTransport`,\n  `Schannel` or `WinHTTP`; the default is `SecureTransport` on macOS,\n  `WinHTTP` on Windows, and whichever of `OpenSSL` or `mbedTLS` is\n  detected on other platforms. Defaults to `ON`.\n* `USE_SHA1=type`: selects the SHA1 mechanism to use; `type` can be set\n  to `CollisionDetection`, `HTTPS` to use the system or HTTPS provider,\n  or one of `OpenSSL`, `OpenSSL-Dynamic`, `OpenSSL-FIPS` (to use FIPS\n  compliant routines in OpenSSL), `CommonCrypto`, or `Schannel`.\n  Defaults to `CollisionDetection`. This option is retained for\n  backward compatibility and should not be changed.\n* `USE_SHA256=type`: selects the SHA256 mechanism to use; `type` can be\n  set to `HTTPS` to use the system or HTTPS driver, `builtin`, or one of\n  `OpenSSL`, `OpenSSL-Dynamic`, `OpenSSL-FIPS` (to use FIPS compliant\n  routines in OpenSSL), `CommonCrypto`, or `Schannel`. Defaults to `HTTPS`.\n* `USE_GSSAPI=<on/off>`: enables GSSAPI for SPNEGO authentication on\n  Unix. Defaults to `OFF`.\n* `USE_HTTP_PARSER=type`: selects the HTTP Parser; either `http-parser`\n  for an external\n  [`http-parser`](https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser) dependency,\n  `llhttp` for an external [`llhttp`](https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp)\n  dependency, or `builtin`. Defaults to `builtin`.\n* `REGEX_BACKEND=type`: selects the regular expression backend to use;\n  one of `regcomp_l`, `pcre2`, `pcre`, `regcomp`, or `builtin`. The\n  default is to use `regcomp_l` where available, PCRE if found, otherwise,\n  to use the builtin.\n* `USE_BUNDLED_ZLIB=type`: selects the bundled zlib; either `ON` or `OFF`.\n  Defaults to using the system zlib if available, falling back to the\n  bundled zlib.\n\nLocating Dependencies\n---------------------\n\nThe `libgit2` project uses `cmake` since it helps with cross-platform\nprojects, especially those with many dependencies. If your dependencies\nare in non-standard places, you may want to use the `_ROOT_DIR` options\nto specify their location. For example, to specify an OpenSSL location:\n\n\t$ cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/tmp/openssl-3.3.2 ..\n\nSince these options are general to CMake, their\n[documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/) may be helpful. If\nyou have questions about dependencies, please [contact us](#getting-help).\n\nRunning Tests\n-------------\n\nOnce built, you can run the tests from the `build` directory with the command\n\n\t$ ctest -V\n\nAlternatively you can run the test suite directly using,\n\n\t$ ./libgit2_tests\n\nInvoking the test suite directly is useful because it allows you to execute\nindividual tests, or groups of tests using the `-s` flag.  For example, to\nrun the index tests:\n\n\t$ ./libgit2_tests -sindex\n\nTo run a single test named `index::racy::diff`, which corresponds to\nthe test function\n[`test_index_racy__diff`](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/blob/main/tests/libgit2/index/racy.c#L22):\n\n\t$ ./libgit2_tests -sindex::racy::diff\n\nThe test suite will print a `.` for every passing test, and an `F` for any\nfailing test.  An `S` indicates that a test was skipped because it is not\napplicable to your platform or is particularly expensive.\n\n**Note:** There should be _no_ failing tests when you build an unmodified\nsource tree from a [release](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/releases),\nor from the [main branch](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/tree/main).\nPlease contact us or\n[open an issue](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/issues)\nif you see test failures.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install the library you can specify the install prefix by setting:\n\n\t$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/prefix\n\t$ cmake --build . --target install\n\nAdvanced Usage\n--------------\n\nFor more advanced use or questions about CMake please read the\n[CMake FAQ](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ).\n\nThe following CMake variables are declared:\n\n- `CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR`: Where to install binaries to.\n- `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`: Where to install libraries to.\n- `CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR`: Where to install headers to.\n- `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`: Build libgit2 as a Shared Library (defaults to ON)\n- `BUILD_TESTS`: Build the unit and integration test suites (defaults to ON)\n- `USE_THREADS`: Build libgit2 with threading support (defaults to ON)\n\nTo list all build options and their current value, you can do the\nfollowing:\n\n\t# Create and set up a build directory\n\t$ mkdir build && cd build\n\t$ cmake ..\n\n\t# List all build options and their values\n\t$ cmake -L\n\nCompiler and linker options\n---------------------------\n\nThere are several options that control the behavior of the compiler and\nlinker. These flags may be useful for cross-compilation or specialized\nsetups.\n\n- `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`: Set your own compiler flags\n- `CMAKE_C_STANDARD`: the C standard to compile against; defaults to `C90`\n- `CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS`: whether compiler extensions are supported; defaults to `OFF`\n- `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`: Override the search path for libraries\n- `ZLIB_LIBRARY`, `OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY` AND `OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY`:\nTell CMake where to find those specific libraries\n- `LINK_WITH_STATIC_LIBRARIES`: Link only with static versions of\nsystem libraries\n\nmacOS\n-------\n\nIf you'd like to work with Xcode, you can generate an Xcode project with \"-G Xcode\".\n\n\t# Create and set up a build directory\n\t$ mkdir build && cd build\n\t$ cmake -G Xcode ..\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Universal binary support:\n> \n> If you want to build a universal binary for macOS 11.0+, CMake sets it\n> all up for you if you use `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"x86_64;arm64\"`\n> when configuring.\n> \n> [Deprecated] If you want to build a universal binary for Mac OS X\n> (10.4.4 ~ 10.6), CMake sets it all up for you if you use\n> `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"i386;x86_64\"` when configuring.\n\niOS\n-------\n\n1. Get an iOS cmake toolchain File:\n\nYou can use a pre-existing toolchain file like [ios-cmake](https://github.com/leetal/ios-cmake) or write your own.\n\n2. Specify the toolchain and system Name:\n\n- The CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable points to the toolchain file for iOS.\n- The CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME should be set to iOS.\n\n3. Example Command:\n\nAssuming you're using the ios-cmake toolchain, the command might look like this:\n\n```\ncmake -G Xcode -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/ios.toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DPLATFORM=OS64 ..\n```\n\n4. Build the Project:\n\nAfter generating the project, open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode, select your iOS device or simulator as the target, and build your project.\n\nAndroid\n-------\n\nExtract toolchain from NDK using, `make-standalone-toolchain.sh` script.\nOptionally, crosscompile and install OpenSSL inside of it. Then create CMake\ntoolchain file that configures paths to your crosscompiler (substitute `{PATH}`\nwith full path to the toolchain):\n\n\tSET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)\n\tSET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION Android)\n\n\tSET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   {PATH}/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc)\n\tSET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER {PATH}/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-g++)\n\tSET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH {PATH}/sysroot/)\n\n\tSET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)\n\tSET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)\n\tSET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)\n\nAdd `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE={pathToToolchainFile}` to cmake command\nwhen configuring.\n\nMinGW\n-----\n\nIf you want to build the library in MinGW environment with SSH support\nenabled, you may need to pass\n`-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=\"${MINGW_PREFIX}/${MINGW_CHOST}/lib/\"` flag\nto CMake when configuring. This is because CMake cannot find the\nWin32 libraries in MinGW folders by default and you might see an\nerror message stating that CMake could not resolve `ws2_32` library\nduring configuration.\n\nAnother option would be to install `msys2-w32api-runtime` package before\nconfiguring. This package installs the Win32 libraries into `/usr/lib`\nfolder which is by default recognized as the library path by CMake.\nPlease note though that this package is meant for MSYS subsystem which\nis different from MinGW.\n\nLanguage Bindings\n==================================\n\nHere are the bindings to libgit2 that are currently available:\n\n* C++\n    * libqgit2, Qt bindings <https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/libs/libqgit2/repository/>\n* Chicken Scheme\n    * chicken-git <https://wiki.call-cc.org/egg/git>\n* D\n    * dlibgit <https://github.com/s-ludwig/dlibgit>\n* Delphi\n    * GitForDelphi <https://github.com/libgit2/GitForDelphi>\n    * libgit2-delphi <https://github.com/todaysoftware/libgit2-delphi>\n* Erlang\n    * Geef <https://github.com/carlosmn/geef>\n* Go\n    * git2go <https://github.com/libgit2/git2go>\n* GObject\n    * libgit2-glib <https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libgit2-glib>\n* Guile\n\t* Guile-Git <https://gitlab.com/guile-git/guile-git>\n* Haskell\n    * hgit2 <https://github.com/jwiegley/gitlib>\n* Java\n    * Jagged <https://github.com/ethomson/jagged>\n    * Git24j <https://github.com/git24j/git24j>\n* Javascript / WebAssembly ( browser and nodejs )\n    * WASM-git <https://github.com/petersalomonsen/wasm-git>\n* Julia\n    * LibGit2.jl <https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/tree/master/stdlib/LibGit2>\n* Lua\n    * luagit2 <https://github.com/libgit2/luagit2>\n* .NET\n    * libgit2sharp <https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp>\n* Node.js\n    * nodegit <https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit>\n* Objective-C\n    * objective-git <https://github.com/libgit2/objective-git>\n* OCaml\n    * ocaml-libgit2 <https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-libgit2>\n* Parrot Virtual Machine\n    * parrot-libgit2 <https://github.com/letolabs/parrot-libgit2>\n* Perl\n    * Git-Raw <https://github.com/jacquesg/p5-Git-Raw>\n* Pharo Smalltalk\n    * libgit2-pharo-bindings <https://github.com/pharo-vcs/libgit2-pharo-bindings>\n* PHP\n    * php-git2 <https://github.com/RogerGee/php-git2>\n* Python\n    * pygit2 <https://github.com/libgit2/pygit2>\n* R\n    * gert <https://docs.ropensci.org/gert>\n    * git2r <https://github.com/ropensci/git2r>\n* Ruby\n    * Rugged <https://github.com/libgit2/rugged>\n* Rust\n    * git2-rs <https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs>\n* Swift\n    * SwiftGit2 <https://github.com/SwiftGit2/SwiftGit2>\n    * SwiftGitX <https://github.com/ibrahimcetin/SwiftGitX>\n* Tcl\n    * lg2 <https://github.com/apnadkarni/tcl-libgit2>\n* Vala\n    * libgit2.vapi <https://github.com/apmasell/vapis/blob/master/libgit2.vapi>\n\nIf you start another language binding to libgit2, please let us know so\nwe can add it to the list.\n\nHow Can I Contribute?\n==================================\n\nWe welcome new contributors!
